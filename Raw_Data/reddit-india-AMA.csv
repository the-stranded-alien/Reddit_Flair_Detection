You can check the [video by The Wire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6RJPJMKplE) where they ask many **actual** citizens (not days old) of Kashmir their perception. Perception of majority is that they want fee Kashmir, but what they always fail to answer is about what will they do after freedom and what will be policy and laws given that 3 nuclear countries live next to you.

Posting it here as Reddit in general, and this community in particular, have been a refuge over the last year as I shunned the rest of social media to prepare for civil services. It's great to know that so many level headed and witty people are out here, rising above the petty politics and crass humour that otherwise dominates our discourse.

Keep doing you, y'all.

Edit: Well they did tell me I will get some gold if I clear this exam /s :D

Thank you for the gold internet strangers and everyone else for the heartwarming wishes. Forever in your service, starting this August.

I want to start preparing right after my BSc in Physics.

When I clear Mains and get called for interview, will the panel mind that I am very young and don't have any job experience?
Can you please give me any input on that?

Edit: I have already began my preparation, in a manner. I am reading Indian Express everyday, started reading Indian history and economics (finished 9th standard). Do you think hard work + smart work is enough to crack UPSC? Isn't there a lot of luck involved considering only around 300 general students get selected out of around 10k+ seriously studying for it. Do you feel you got lucky in the first attempt? Wow. Happy for you. Congratulations!  Do an AMA if possible. Please marry me? Also, congratulations. Waiting for your AMA. r/Indian_Academia Ama please Congratulations op.

How your life have changed before starting the preparation and after finishing the prep? i mean, what is the effect of this exam on ones personality? Our civil administration does need some psedo liberals.
 Bahut Badhaiyan!
Will be waiting for AMA. *Matrimonial sites want to know your location* Congrats, OP. Hope you will serve the nation to the best of your ability. Congrats liberandu 🏆 People asking about how to clear upsc, use Quora, har jagah shuru hojate ho Congratulations! Please add basic info like optional subject, coaching centre etc. in the original post.  Hey so can u tell me if is it possible to compete UPSC through arts stream or do I have to take science? My parents say science makes it much easier. I don't know how but I guess u can shower some knowledge on it. DO REPLY PLEASE!!!!! Congrats bro, hope you will not convert into some  grumpy ""sir"" very soon. chalo, let's get married. I'm doing MBBS, so we can be the couple of every indian middle class household's dreams Congratulations and welcome to ‘the fellowship’ 😄 I just hope op remembers us when time cometh. congrats bro , hope to see your blog up at insights/forumias soon , all the best  Thanks I hate it. My parents have been telling me stories of kids who cleared UPSC all day.

Seriously though, congratulations brother. Hey... Remember this day whenever you feel depressed or demotivated somewhere along your work. Remember that you have the power to help the needy, do the right thing and stand up against people who do our society bad.

Congratulations. Congrats and most important question.  Do you have a girlfriend?  Congrats Buddy! Dont become one of those 'file sign' sahib. Try to take initiatives and most importantly lower rank officers are one who are corrupted state civil officers/tehsildar etc...so maybe try to bring honesty in department. All the best we need more young officers like you. Proud OP, the score in written part is in my control, I get based on how well I write. Now coming to the interview, how does the panel look at candidates who didn't give up, like let's say I have been at civils for 4 years after my graduation, doesn't that create a bad impression as in the candidate should have done something else rather than putting eggs in one basket?  Ay my man Mark Antony Congratulations  Congratulations! I never thought the day will ever come when an Indian redditor gets to go inside the heart of the national 'system'. Kudos to you.

On a different note (Not trying to be a party pooper or anything),  I feel it's my duty to bring the following up. 

Now the reality of the country's governance, working for the smug senior bureaucrats, swallowing one's pride and principles at the orders of our unethical, poorly literate and absolutely ruthless political masters should hit you after your training.

Don't let these things get you down. Stick to your principles. You will learn to 'adapt' to the system ( but don't do it too much!). At all times, please remember Gandhiji's Talisman. That should make your dilemma easier.

Much respect and well wishes from a concerned citizen. Legalize marijuana when you get there Congratulations!!!!!


Now, How much are you gonna charge to get job done?  

 Well apparently not all of us randians are useless it seems lol...Btw congratulations on your success, I too aspire to join the services someday Congratulations! You're now in a position to make a difference. Don't shun your values and don't become corrupted. Congratulations to you!! 

Overwhelmed to see a fellow redditor get into the Services, so freaking happy and inspired!! 

56 more days to 2019 Prelims and I really hope I get to post here the good news next year!  Another corrupt Government Employee.  Congratulations!!! Congratulations.

Have a great time, ahead :) Congratulations, please do an AMA. Congrats Mate.  Congratulations!!  Congratulations! Hope you will do great to this country. Congrats brother! Treat? Congratulations, how old are you?  Congratulations! Congratulations on your achievement. I hope you serve the country well.  Yes Congratulations OP Congratulations, dude.

Please do an AMA!  Toh kya kren bc Congratulations! Try to be not corrupt!  Dude other services means?? I thought UPSC was for IAS only. Congrats on the exam clearance. But what really makes you exited to be a bureaucrat? You will literally be a cog in the wheel your whole life now. Are you that Kataria guy? Congrats buddy. I wish you the best of luck. Let's clean up and better our country together. 👊 Congratulations!! Congratulation man!! Go and do good.... Acha bath hai Hey that's some positive news to hear today. Good luck with your tenure and be true to yourself and the country. God Bless your journey and your intentions... Congratulations.  You are the unrequited fulfilment of many of the India's citizens. Congrats stranger ! I will also write a post like this someday :) My cousin cleared the same and now my life will becomes hell, a whole lifetime of “why you couldn’t be more like him” non sense its good for you though sure congratulations but it sucks for the rest of your cousins and siblings unless they’re all ias too Congratulations! Hope you have a successful career and you make a big impact wherever you go. There is lots to be done in the country and it is time for our generation to be the change was have always wanted. 

 Super Congratulations to you!

I want to prepare as well, but can't leave the current job for financial responsibilities. Will jot down a plan for doing so over a two year period, let's see how it turns out. Congrats mate! ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" You beauty! Congrats, my brother! I don't know why but I feel very happy and proud! :) Do an AMA please! Congratulations dude!! Now do the good work!  You cleared i  first attempt. That's great. Can you shed some light how to clear this exam. How to prepare ? How much hours you studied ?   Congrats. UPSC isn't my cup of tea. I'll be trying for ESE soon. Let's hope I am able to cope up with entirely different stream :V My dear brother, as much as I want to clear UPSE, I am afraid I am a bit weak in history and geography. I have a decent public sector job and I am trying to clear one of the major exams of 2019. Wish me luck as well. I will hit you up this time around next year with my results. Saving your post for future communication ease. You give me inspiration. 

Also, congratulations are well in order! Please do not get corrupted and do not waste your time like Dipak Rawat raiding small businessmen. I honestly think doing service to the poor should be the top priority. Hope you do us some justice and I hope you do not get pressured politically much. My best wishes are with you.  Congrats, but this isn't facebook. Indian parents want to know your location!! So you browsed reddit and cleared UPSC? KAISE?  Congratulations. Thank you for striving to make India a better place Wish you all the very best in your career.  ""Forever in your service, starting this August"" are seriously going to work for the people or for the ministers or just for the sake of perks you will enjoy rest of your life.

Source: Wikipedia
""In India's parliamentary democracy, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the people's elected representatives—cabinet ministers. But a handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and it is for the civil servants, who serve at the pleasure of the President of India, to carry it out.""

I never understood the concept of working for minister who don't have a degree but want a professional who had cracked objective questions in seconds, penned downed his thoughts flawlessly on holycow and ofcourse his interview rounds.

Would love hear the real reason behind to go for civil services of India.

I am sure the one who has so much knowledge with degree can lay polices also. Clear this dilemma please. Noice Congratulations man

I hope this one feat. Makes you leave a mark of honesty and integrity in india
I love my country but at the same time the petty politics and sheer corruption at every end makes me feel like an alien 
.i wish you propel to change whatever you can under your limits

All the best for your future

Jai Hind! What do you plan to join? Congratulations OP!  Now you have a chance to make a difference. Keep it up my boy..u can do it.

If you don't mind me asking, exactly how many months/years of study you put into preparation?

Also, do you have any bad habits, like smoking, drinking, girls, etc? Congrats, welcome to the services. Look me up if u r allotted maharashtra cadre. Congrats Man.  Happy Future of oppressing the poor and getting corrupted.  Congratulations 🎊  Congrats bro!!! Good to know that u are from general category 👍👍 (read a comment below) Many many congratulations mate! Just 2 Questions -

* At what age did you start preparation for UPSC?

* Did you take *any* coaching?

I'm an aspirant myself. Congratulations! No offence , but are you sc/st or OBC ? As they have quotas , it's easy for them. it is extremely sad to see that indians in 2019 have dreams of working for the indian government and see it as the pinnacle of achievement.

It is very, very sad to see that the oppressive Raj has been replaced with indian rulers. That the population is blind to this is even more discouraging. The incentives of the Raj are almost exactly the same as that of the indian bureaucrat: exploitation and self-enrichment. They have not changed one bit. There are honest people in the bureaucracy but they are few and far between.

It should give us pause that we are celebrating someone joining the single largest organisation responsible for the loot of the nation on a daily basis: the government and bureaucracy. So, what is so appealing in civil services? I am sorry guys, if this sounds offensive to the post. But, I have not been in my country for about 9 years now. And had I known that I can also give civil services and end up in a good position in India, I would have definitely tried. Again, please don’t think I am undermining anything that the OP has done. And, another question is, can this exam be given by a person of any age? Like me, I am 31. Can I also give this exam and get into a good position in India? Thanks for listening patiently guys. Again, I repeat, no offense to the original poster. Peace! 

Comgrats to OP!!!! Sorry, my bad... Good, now lick Mudi kaka's arse 😂",AMA,2019-04-06 14:44:18
So this happened yesterday [R],613,bcz7em,https://imgur.com/DJXElBz,77,,High24x7," the fact that they are acknowledging the problem and giving you a refund instead of a 50 rupees coupon is surprisingly good So after chain snatching, food snatching is common now. Recently zomato delivery guy was also skeptical about giving me my order until I showed him the app and the order. He said people have been snatching orders recently. Which city is this? 

Happened to me once in Gurgaon. Two guys snatched a couple of pizzas from the delivery boy. He was very apologetic about it but I had to tell him not to worry. I don't expect him to fight with two burly guys over a fucking pizza. #justgurgaonthings :P Wtf? Is food order snatching a thing now? He's said it so calmly ,like this is a common thing that happens every now and then [removed] ""... delivery agent has *confirmed* that somebody snatched the order..""

He had to check twice to make sure they just wouldn't run around the block and give it back :D

It's pretty hilarious but I guess it's also worth noting that it's dangerous to be a food delivery person at 12:00am.

Edit: Fix Quote and typos This is hilarious ! The next time make sure to snatch the order yourself. :D FIR file kro. Cctv recordings check kro. We live in a society OP is ordering at 1230 am with 9% battery . Bad luck indeed ! Not sure if reddiquette is the appropriate tag here. Were you expecting to kickstart a conversation on prevalence of forcible dispossession of packaged sustenance from mobile vehicle-mounted agents in Indian urban spheres? Pretty sure this must be in NCR Lmao [removed] He took exactly 2 more minutes lol Happened with me on uber eats, turns out there was a strike among drivers so they were the ones who attacked 🤦‍♂️ After reading the comments now I realized why Zomato delivery guys started asking me from which name the order was placed. It all makes sense now r/uselessgreencircle Which city? Pretty common occurrence where I live in Gurgaon.. :/ r/wellthatsucks Man..! I need to keep an eye on my lunch box. Wow that's crazy This is apparently very common. There are 'black zones' in every city where such things happen. Delivery guys get kidnapped into the house, their wallets and food stolen and they are beaten before they are let go. Not sure if police cases get filed in such cases. Loool!!! love the honesty",AMA,2019-04-14 12:27:08

AMA Request: A Kashmiri Pandit over 30 years old.,70,cnhzlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cnhzlf/ama_request_a_kashmiri_pandit_over_30_years_old/,74,"Now that 370 and 35A have been abolished, a few questions:

1. How do you perceive the Law and Order situation to evolve over the short term?

2. What are your expectations regarding returning to Kashmir?

3. Do you wish to return back to your ancestral house?

4. Would you be willing to pay back all the facilities that have been provided to you by the government for the past 30 years? For example, would you be willing to give up the housing that you got if you get your old house back?

5. Should reservation for Kashmiri Pandits be withdrawn now?",contraryview," I know one but he's 20. I'll try to contact his father. One of my closest school friends is KP, but I don't think he's on Reddit

His entire family is very happy about the decision of course My ex gf was, but eh, we don't talk any more. Got another opinion from a friend: 

""Answering as Kashmiri Pandit (KP) born in 1990, we lost our home, business, identity, culture, health and became refugee in our own country. No amount of  compensation can make KPs to go back because of one simple reason we lost trust in other community. My generation has heard and read horror stories of migration and how our kashmiri brothers watched while we were butchered. We don't know what future holds but exodus of my community will always be darkest chapter in the history of Kashmir. I dont know about others but I wont be able to ever go back. Its not to the point and emotions get in the way. Getting government assigned flats and houses is a good deal but it doesn't change the fact we lost our heritage and culture.""

Also he suggested you google Girja tickoo and Satish tickoo and read ""Our moon has blood clots"" I foresee the situation to worsen in Kashmir while it will get better in Jammu and Ladakh. This will predominantly be because of separatists and other locals who might have been rendered slightly powerless. There is a reason why PM sent more armed forces into the state.
As for my return, i can list out a few reasons why i do not want to return:
1. Highly volatile atmosphere with frequent disruptions due to militancy, army. 
2. Not many opportunities work wise
3. Presence of radical islamists and separatists in the valley makes me believe that it’s very easy for 1990 to repeat itself . There is a reason why extra army is present in Kashmir at the moment
4. sold off the only house we had in Srinagar for peanuts after finally giving up the idea of returning. Some of my cousins’ houses were burnt down or squatters simply moved in. In short, there is no neighborhood I can think of returning to.
5. Younger cousins and the generation after has grown up outside of Kashmir with only language or food binding them to Kashmir. No point thrusting them into this chaos. 

Your question #4 does not make sense at all. How can you quantify someone’s loss that too after 30 years? Keep in mind, people did not only lose house or property, but whole lives were uprooted. The community has nearly lost its identity outside of JK and will essentially be non existent with in next 50 -100 years. Can you put a $ figure on it?

I am also not sure what reservations are you referring to in question #5. Kashmiri here, however, under 30.  
I will try to get someone to get your questions answered. I asked someone who is Kashmiri and above 30 years. Below is  his view :

""I  think everyone has his view point. One has to answer these questions today or tomorrow as these are the relevant questions. We still do not understand our position yet and what government of India has decided for us. Are we still migrants or that tag has been removed from us ? The situation says wait and watch."" Ama request. Rahul Pandita. KP was old enough to understand what was going on in 90s and Young enough to say us his opinions. RemindMe! 1 day Can we get anupam kher to do an ama? I'm 26 and from the Kashmiri Pandit community. Given my age, I agree that I'm not in the best position to answer OP's questions but I can take a stab if they're still interested. But below are some general thoughts if anyone's interested:

My parents were forced to leave Kashmir in 1989-90 and move to a place at the other end of the country where I grew up. They haven't been back since - just briefly for a week on vacation to show me what it's like about 15 years ago. And it's sad and terrible. But, it's possible to recognize the plight of Kashmiri Hindus that had their lives uprooted overnight 30 years ago while also recognizing that what's happening right now is upsetting, undemocratic and unconstitutional. 

Unfortunately, Indians (and the KP community to a large degree) has been consumed by bloodlust and it's fucking saddening. What's worse - and I find bewildering - is how none from the KP community were in support of repealing 370 until Modi showed up in 2014 and they realized this would be a way to unleash a fresh hell in Kashmir under the garb of ""patriotism"" and ""unification"" (perhaps I'm projecting too much malice on to their intentions when I should chalk it up to stupidity and propaganda). I don't think the community itself stands to gain a lot from this. 

The most honest analysis is that historically, a lot of parties - including those suffering the most today - fucked up but no one took ownership then and now it's just spiraled out of control after how oppressive the Indian government has been there. You expect States to be reasonable actors in these situations and not stoop to the level of terrorists because either way, it's the common person who's affected the most. And, as things stand today, while the Kashmiri Hindus have been rehabilitated elsewhere to a reasonable degree, more than two generations of Kashmiris who stayed in Kashmir (primarily Muslims and Sikh) grew up in the world's most militarized zone. I'm extremely pessimistic about the situation. I am quite certain that we're living through the creation of another West Bank here. I am a Kashmiri Pandit, I turn 30 in a few months. I know many Kashmir Pandits over 30, including my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles.

1. I am of the opinion that Kashmir will be violent in the short term. Extremist violence is common in Kashmir, why should this situation be any different?
2. We will never return to Kashmir, outside of the occasional very short trip. I have been to Kashmir once in my life, despite my father begging me not to go, for my safety. I had to see the place that haunts my entire family, at least once. My father has been back once since the 1980s. The handful of elderly relatives that remained are slowly dying off. 
3. Our ancestral house was sold under duress while my family was in exile. Our neighbors are the onces who forced us to sell, under threat of violence. The bones still exist, but it was turned into a shopping mall. We won't return because we'll never feel safe. 
4. My family was not provided housing by the government of India. We were privileged enough to pay for our own housing. Many family members settled in the Delhi area and have done well for themselves since. Some family members  have moved to the US, Dubai, Singapore and elsewhere and have also done quite well for themselves. I know that my family is not the kind of Pandit you're asking the question about, but it is true that the Kashmiri diaspora has very little incentive to come back as they have rather good lives outside of Kashmir. Of course, those who are still refugees are different, but come on - Kashmri Pandits who have a modicum of success aren't moving back to a remote valley with poor infrastructure and a majority of inhabitants that could want us dead at any moment. 
5. Yes. The reservation was an ill-intentioned policy that failed Kashmiris and prevented the proper integration of Kashmir with India.

I am by no means a Hindu nationalist and I think the Indian government deserves plenty of blame for the situation in Kashmir as well as the plight of Kashmiri Pandits (as does the Pakistini government, and Kashmiri Muslims).

Frankly, I think Kashmiri Pandits are beside the point in this discussion, because Kashmiri Muslims succeeded in exterminating our culture. Without anchoring to the homeland, there aren't enough of us to carry it forward and those numbers continue to dwindle as we marry non-Kashmiris. In a generation or two, Kashmiri Pandits will cease to exist in any meaningful way and no policy will save that so policy making shouldn't consider ""our plight""

Policy making should have considered our plight 30 years ago, but now it's too late. Without internet and swarm of Bharat ke garam naujawan in reddit. I think I can see if no one turns up. In past perspective from Kashmiris were not well received by virath Bharat ke veer on this sub. [removed] [removed]",AMA,2019-08-08 14:53:43

Is this Indian Hogwarts? 9¾? But there no such thing as 9¾..is there? Try going into the paper and see if you end up in the Hogwarts train. 😁 .5 marks for Delhi instead of New Delhi ? I really liked how the paper was very secular , gave you information about somr major religions which most people I know don't know about Where are you now? It’s interesting that most of the questions are about religion. Why is the country obsessed with religion? You are one year senior to me.

I am an Indian getting married to a Pakistani girl later this summer. AMA!,263,c0hmag,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c0hmag/i_am_an_indian_getting_married_to_a_pakistani/,255,"As controversial as it seems, this journey has been extremely difficult for both of us. Amidst recent tensions between both the countries and general temperament of the people, it was a challenge to get people to agree to this arrangement. The only thing that made it easier is the fact that we are both muslim. I am a proud Indian and love my country, however, this marriage arrangement is being faced with alot of criticism from friends, families and colleagues. It has been highly stressful psychologically as well.

I wanted to share this experience that I endured for a year and the troubles we both faced in the light of modern politics and peoples mindsets. To give you some background: I am from Bangalore, born and bought up and she is from Lahore, we both met in London at uni where we fell In love and decided to get married. Go ahead, ask me anything!",muaazkhn," So, reverse Sania Mirza!

Congrats! Which side has better Biryani? Also congratulations op! Who will your kids support during Ind vs Pak?
**Congratulations anyway** I just want to congratulate you! Wish you a very happy married life!! Name you're kid Kashmir. Do play Lahore by Guru Randhawa on your wedding if you can. It would be fun. [deleted] Wow, British are finally making amends! Congrats op! How hot are her friends man? Please seek blessings from Mudikaka. What were your parents reaction when you told the about the marriage? 
Also, what religion will you be teaching your children if at all you want to. Unless you plan to stay internationally you're bound to face huge problems in bringing her to India and her going back to Pakistan for visits etc.given the tense situation which can blow up anytime into a war like one.

How'd you plan to handle it? Congratulations! Punjaban, good luck man. What did her parents and relatives have to say about the arrangement? Congratulations man! God bless you both! Dating a Pakistani was fun when I was in London, but I wouldn’t have had the balls to marry one. Kudos!

Just remember one thing, even if you guys end up getting British citizenship, Indian govt for the purpose of immigration when you enter the country won’t allow her a visa on arrival that other Brit citizens are eligible for since she would be an ex-Pakistani citizen. 

However, that is atleast about 7 years away, so meanwhile she would be getting these short term visas. And by short term I’m talking in days and not months. Max my Pakistani friend who got married to an Indian from WB has gotten is 45 days. He is a  green card holder, she has American passport with PIO. 

Don’t let these small irritants deter you from celebrating the glory of your marriage. 

God bless you two again! Congrats!

Do both of u plan on changing your citizenship to become UK citizens?

Also which university did both of u go to?😂 Are you planning to introduce your wife to some nice Idly/Chutney from SLV and Masala Dosa from CTR? was she da bomb though? (no offense xd) Congratulations dude!

Out of curiosity

&#x200B;

\>however, this marriage arrangement is being faced with alot of criticism from friends, families and colleagues

&#x200B;

is this due to political differences between india/pak ie nationalism (If so more from pakistan side or indian side)? Or are there significant cultural differences causing this?

&#x200B;

Also what kind of cultural differences have u faced in dating her? Good for you & her. Congrats. Benglur ke musalmaana ka naam roshan karreen bhai. Harrow or Newham?

Stay in London. Your future wife is also dong an AMA? If not, asl her abd sharethr link too So what’s the marriage called ? Samjhauta Express ? I don't believe you. Better send me an invitation and allow me to check the food counter to verify if they are authentic Indian or Pakistan cuisine. 



XD. Congrats OP! You are very wholesome person OP.... 

Also when you go to Lahore make sure you know the location of all handpumps  :P When you are getting married don't bring a cat/kitten in a basket :p I wonder what would've happened if you belonged to some other religion. Hey, congrats man!

Since the time you met her, how have your perceptions about Pakistan or her about India changed? Please send pics of food. Thanks. Congratulations. Do you think more relationships like this may ease the tension between the two countries? I read that you're planning to settle in London and register the marriage there. Did you get married in India and then request to get the marriage registered in London?

Also are you from London and will be sponsoring her as a dependent? Omg this is so cute man, who made the first move? Ok.. What are the real problem that you faced?

He said this to me ""aadha amrican aur adha indian to thah, phir bewi ney lar kar aur adha indian kar diya. this is one of the most wholesome threads ever. I had a friend in Melbourne, Punjabi Sikh who had married a Pakistani Muslim girl who was Australian born and brought up. Neither of the families raised any issue since they were not residing in India. Can't imagine how that would've turned had they been  residents back home. Congrats man. Though apparently its not unheard of for Indian origin and Pakistani origin people to marry in UK, especially among muslims. It's all one big desi community once you leave your home country. Once you settle in there, no one will bother you. Have fun. Weird flex, but ok^/s Congratulations sir :)

Just curious, if you have discussed this, was there any difference in how India/Pak's historical events were perceived by her and by you. Might be interesting to know how much of the information passed on to us in our/their history books/media is correct or not. Congratulations.
Have you visited Pakistan to visit her fam? Or did your girl's family visit you and your fam in India? 
Where do you plan to get married? I already see too many visa problems either way. 
All the best for your life, Pakistani women are very beautiful :) Tennis wali sania Dulha khojal Pakistani Invite me to your marriage pleassseeeee. I LOVE BIRYANI and would enjoy the culture as well. For me its a bit more complicated. I am a brahmin, but we are ready for the challenges lying ahead!! all the best to you. Was religion a big factor? I'm assuming you follow Islam because of your username. If so, did it help in any way? Are you planning to stay in London or will you move to India/Pakistan?

Also, how is your family being treated if they live in India? Are you going to live In India or Pakistan after that? Congrats man. Wishing you guys a lifetime of love and happiness. 👍🏻👍🏻 so are you from westminster/ lse ? Congrats buddy!
Hope it doesn't rain during this Indo-Pak match.

India's first indigenous processor developed at IIT Bombay. I am a designer AMA!!,4386,bfrh0g,https://i.redd.it/37dmt3wfnnt21.jpg,622,,prabot," Well done OP, but honestly you should have shared more details.

> [Welcome AJIT, a ‘Made in India’ Microprocessor](
https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-‘made-india’-microprocessor) 

> Prof. Madhav Desai and his team of about nine researchers from IIT Bombay have designed and developed the processor entirely at the institute. The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  and IIT Bombay. Powai Labs, a Mumbai-based company, has also invested in the venture and will own, market and support the product. 

> AJIT’s features can be compared to many of the microprocessors of its size available in today’s market. Unlike the ones used in the desktops like the Intel’s Xeon, AJIT is a medium-sized processor. It can be used inside a set-top box, as a control panel for automation systems, in a traffic light controller or even robotic systems. What’s more, the researchers expect that AJIT will cost as less as ₹100 when it is produced en-masse. 

> AJIT can run one instruction per clock cycle and can operate at clock speeds between 70-120MHz, comparable to its competitors in the market.

> “We have been working on this processor design for more than two years now. The design has been tested on programmable semiconductor chips before we began our effort towards fabricating the processor,” says Prof. Desai

> The researchers have made the software tools associated with AJIT freely available to everyone. The processor is also available as a ‘softcore’, where vendors can buy a license to use the design of the microprocessor and fabricate it to use it in their system. The researchers also offer to customise the processor for specific applications.


There is a lot more info in the article. ELI5 how it is different from other processors and where IITB is planning to use it? Any RISC while using this? Can it run Crysis???? Whats next? How you are going forward with this ? a. How is this different from SHAKTHI?

b. In What kind of hardware these chips might end up in? Laptops may be....?

c. Any plans for mass producing? Have a few questions for you..

1. Which module(s) were you part of?

2. Which HDL was the processor coded in?

3. What was the technology node this was done in? And what was the method of building standard cell library?

4. Which language/methodology was used for verification?

5. What was your preferred method for DFT?

6. Can you disclose the layout, package analysis and SI tools?

7. Which aspect of the processor, according to you, was most challenging?

8. Is this our own fab? I'm dying to know we can have cutting edge fab tech in India. Been watching out for this for about 2 decades now.

Thanks for this ama, and keep doing the good work! Congratulations! Are there going to be further iterations, or is this the final product? And are you going to dive into mass production straightaway? what are the commercial applications or is it just a milestep to develop something even more complex Can it run Chrome with five open tabs? I'm a non IT guy (Accounts). Can someone explain the significance of this? Wasn't the 1st microprocessor developed by IIT Madras? Shakti.  How is it different from it & can it compete with Intel? Can we build a low cost Raspberry Pi/Arduino alternative with this chip? Or what kind of hardware specs are yet to be integrated in this for one to realise a functioning SBC for the DIY maker community. Thanks for doing this AMA! I'm really interested in the field of architecture.
Does this processor implement pipelining? Does it dispatch instructions in order or does it implement out of order dispatch/processing? Why not RISC? What is the design team size at IITB? I assume the final synthesis, verification, and layout was done in Cadence? How many design cycles did you need before taping out the final version? Sorry for too many questions! Once the final version is out into mass production, can we have a course like *NAND to Tetris*, where they try to teach us how an entire computer is built out of nand gate. 

Something like this for electronics(in this case the design) which will ease the fear and improve the understanding, of course this should come out in free time How much did it cost to develop this processor? Is this the same as developed in IIT Madras?? Which was fabricated for free at Oregon? Wow. This is amazing!!

I'm guessing this is based on open source hardware. Is the architecture of this cpu available to take a look at? Congratulations! Can you give a bit of a overview of what it is capable of? What kind of skills would i need to become a part of something like this? I'm currently doing my undergrad in ECE. Which subjects should i focus more on to develop the skills you have to make a chip like this? Hey,

While I really commend the AJIT work from IIT Bombay, I feel there are quite a few mis-conceptions in the AMA which need to be addressed. This is in no way critical of AJIT, just that people should be more aware of the information they consume.

>IIT Madras partnered with Bluespec to work in collaboration with them for a major part. Here we have implemented everything from scratch.

Untrue. IIT Madras used the Bluespec language. It's like saying if I used Rust, I worked in collaboration with Mozilla. Now the counter-point given here by OP of AMA is that it is an American company and Ajit is developed in India, so all good. Now let me tell you, developing a language and compiler is hard. That is why Bluespec started at MIT, has one of the few companies that has got it right and with around 10 years of experience in this field, their product is really good for processor dev. Also, Bluespec has DARPA funded programs, which increases the confidence in their language.

Bluespec is happy to give free licenses to educational institutions! Do check them out. Finally, the code we write in Bluespec is owned by the writers, no **partnering with Bluespec**.

>Yes, it is a pipelined processor and thus in-order.

Mate, don't expect to make statements like these if you designed a processor by yourself. Your statement implies, a pipelined processor is always in-order. So are Intel/Amd chips not pipelined, as they are out-of-order. I'll give you the benefit of doubt that you mis-typed that, hope you get across.

>RISC-V is not considered a stable architecture by many people around the world and is not a proven architecture whereas Sparc is an old but proven architecture and hence was a better choice.

I don't know where you get this from mate. Did you know the Pixel 3 from Google has a RISC-V core in it? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7aAUlHoV2E&t=55s)

Or that NVIDIA is going to use RISC-V in their GPU's? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg1lISJfJI0&t=645s)

Or that Western Digital has already committed to replacing all their chips with RISC-V cores, and they have open source cores out there? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlIhU_vovP0)

The only notable company I knew anything about developing Sparc processors was Fujitsu, for supercomputers. Even they moved to ARM -

>We first caught wind of the Post-K supercomputer back in June 2016, when Fujitsu unveiled some of the architectural features of the future machine and confirmed its switch from Sparc64-fx motors to a custom Arm chip.

[Link](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/08/24/fujitsus-a64fx-arm-chip-waves-the-hpc-banner-high/)

>Shakti was built using proprietary software and this has been built from scratch so technically this is the first one. Yes, it is an SoC. I can't reveal that information here because of NDAs. The compiler already exists for Sparc-v8 and has been provided by GNU org.

So then don't call it India's first indigenous processor. Call it India's first indigenous processor-design language and not India's **first indigenous processor.** Because Shakti with the open-source code-base - [Link](https://bitbucket.org/casl/c-class), an ACM publication - [Paper](https://acc.digital/shakti-an-open-source-processor-ecosystem/) can safely claim to have been designed before you.

Anyways, it doesn't matter if Shakti was even the 10th fucking processor in line after miles, it would just be better if [u/prabot](https://www.reddit.com/u/prabot) stopped making misinformed comments. If you call yourself an academician working at a prestigious place like IITB, you should put a bit more thought into your responses. Are you planning to do MBA from IIMA as well. What's the cost compared to an Intel/AMD processor? And clock speed? What was the most challenging part? Are you from electronics or CSE? As a cse student from another iit this sounds a great development and shows the amount of hard work you guys put in research. Congratulations!  
 
PS : hire me in next placement season What is the purpose of creating this processor? Do you see India as a competent nation Atleast in terms of necessary resources for setting international industrial standards for this chip in near future(10-15 years)?

Summing up,can we use these chips like the pic/Arm/Avr in anytime in future or is it too early to call a shot? Congrats! Any plans for a retail development board? What is the full form of AJIT? Will you employ americans to do your telephone support? What were your biggest challenges ? When was this accomplished? [Link to the detailed article](https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-%E2%80%98made-india%E2%80%99-microprocessor)

P.S : Thanks to u/kash_if Congrats!

Are you going to release it publically? Like for use in phones and computers? Or is it going to be reserved for research purposes?

Also how is it better than currently used processors? i seem to be more interested in how did you get involved. i have similar ambitions. could you, please? How good is fabrication from SCL? Are you going to open source the instruction set, bootloader code, etc? Where can I download the RTL, is it there on opencores? Business Perspective: Will India be into processor fabrication, like how it is into IT services. Do we have required raw materials and the process to fabricate with cost lesser than importing one. I have a more general question. China is investing a lot in semiconductors in order to reduce chip imports. It also has companies like HiSilicon which is aiming for competing with the likes of Qualcomm. India is obviously not quite there yet but there have been voices calling for this for years.

How realistic should we be with our expectations? When could we see an Indian competitors to these kinds of companies? Do you think the state needs to step in the way it has in China with massive financial support or do you think the private sector can do it on its own with some collaboration with academia? Thanks. - Is the tech used on par with what other international makers are using? Where do we fall behind? 

- Why would a device maker use this processor instead of commercially available similar processors?

- How far is it from mass production? Will it even be mass produced or just remain a lab experiment?

- Why do you think are we so far behind in this space? Almost all developed countries have dozens of fab plants and India has just one? Why is govt. not investing in this industry, this industry alone could give a massive boost to the Indian economy? What instruction set? [deleted] 1)Does it require its own motherboard or is it compatible with commercial available mobo.                    
   2) How will you compare it with current gen CPU of Intel and AMD,like which processor will it be comparable to.             
               3)How much RAM it supoort How far is it from mass production? When could we see any company or you announcing real world products? I don't really have a question - just wanted to congratulate you and the entire team - hope this endeavor continues to even greater heights. Well done! Where is the technical documentation? Is this going to be an open core? That is so fucking cool. Kitna deti hai? I don’t know much about processors or about tech in India but it looks cool and you have my upvote We were told you were making this, in VJTI. One time Prof. Girish Kumar mentioned this too. Congratulations on its completion. 💜 Now we’ll have to call America for support Respect bro A wonderful achievement itself , I hope that we can see India producing microprocessors with the likes of Intel or AMD's flagship microprocessors at a cheap rate and paving the new generation of microprocessors for the betterment of technology and the country soon enough. Congrats, you've made us proud! Btech or Mtech Honest question: why have you started this AMA on a Sunday past midnight? fabrication ? 
10 nm ? x86, ARM or something new? Can it run Crysis? [deleted] Which Architecture dose it support and what is max data carrying and crunching capacity of this processor ? Where and by whom did you get the fabrication done?

Do you think we can get mobile phone manufacturers to set up high volume fabrication (not assembly, which are already in few places or will be) plants in India? 
Congratulations quite happy to see development of a processor in India 
Can you list the issues facing the semi conductor development and  fabrication sector in our country? like we do not have a single fab company That manufacturers of devices could use What is the distance between its transistors? How did you get into the process of creating it? How does it differ from other processors in terms of performance and efficiency? I am assuming there must be some caveats as this is a new project so can you please mention them. Specs details? Are you looking to make it an industry standard, if yes, what advantage does it have over intel or similar popular processors First of all many many congratulations..!! 
So what are the future plans? Only use it for the systems and applications you mentioned above? Or near future you have any commercialization plans for this processor to be used in PC's? How can i be involed in any manner in any kind of process within this project? . Damn keen on knowing/understanding this development. [deleted] Wasn't Shakti the first one?
How similar are the two?
Major applications? Could you please share what processor node this was based on? Is it market ready or still a kind of prototype? If it is market ready, what are the next plans for use of this mp? But the real question is, can you game with it? RISC based ? How is it compared to the currently available same type of processors? Thanks for the ama!
Some questions I have-

1. What tools did you use for apr? And does Iit bombay have good license support?

2. You mentioned you’re moving to 65, which fab would this be made by?

3. Does Scl supply any memory compilers?

4. How much of the chip was made in custom?

5. Why did you use vhdl instead of system verilog? Why have you named it Ajit man ? We already got a ""Ajit Pai"" meme, the dude who tried to destroy internet, now soon we will have Ajit processor meme's, why on Earth would you name a processor Ajit ? Why not something like Arjun, Drona, Bhishma, Ram, Shiv, Karna, Karma, Duryodhan, Ravan, Hanuman, Bajrang, Vayu, Trimorti, Bheem or anything else ? So this is different from the “Shakti” processor from IIT Madras? This looks really cool. What desktop processor does it compare to in terms of performance ? I have answered a lot of questions in a short while. I think I will come back after a bit. Please keep the questions coming I am really excited about upcoming questions. Where do plan to get it fabricated at 65nm? Is SCL starting fabrication at 65nm? Is Mass production of this going to happen in India or abroad? I read you said it'll be mass produced at an aim of 100rs but will that be possible to be done within in India? Does India have a leap-frog advantage of starting late in this field? Like the lack of credit cards was okay since we leap frogged to finance apps for credit Don't know much about processors but that looks gorgeous This is exicitng. 
Nano meter? Also do you think we'll be able to mass produce? If AJIT was comparable in performance and speed to a commercially available processor that was made in the past, which one would you equate it to? Any reason behind the name AJIT ?  
Also, congrats and good luck What incentive do businesses have to design their products using this processor? Does it require external cooling? Or is the IHS enough to cool this processor? What kind of power consumption can it handle? Also does What kind of TDP applies to it. You've made so proud and happy OP we need more of you. How complicated is the manufacturing for this processor? Process node? Are there any public papers on how their transistor performance compares to competitors ? What are some pros and cons from x86 and Arm Congratulations :D How commercially viable is this processor. When ARM, Intel and AMD are flooded the market. Do you have any plans to sell Dev kits like raspberry pi? What exactly has been built from ground up? Is it the ISA? Is is the underlying VLSI? Is the actual fab done in India? Can it make me a sandwich? What next? It's 2019 ffs. Congratulations OP. You guys have accomplished a enormous task. I am proud of you people. Some questions if you don't mind.

1-Are guys planning to release an SoC of this.?
2-Is there 64 bit or further in the future?
3-How many no of transistors does it have?
4-Is it able to run the Linux Kernel?
5-What was the most challenging part in the design of the AJIT? Why didn’t we make it any time sooner? What were the challenges that stopped us from making this processor in earlier decades?
There are some really famous and efficient processors readily available in the market at affordable price. Are you planning to get this project to that level or is it only for research purposes. Compare it with something like ARM7 / ARM M4 ? I’ve installed a chip like that by hand. Hand formed, hand soldered. This is a remarkable feat but this causes a brief flashback. Aside from the awesome technical accomplishment,  I must also acknowledge the pleasing aesthetic of your product.

Congratulations! Hey great work indeed. How big are the dimensions of current processor? I’ll buy a development board if there ever is one available! Does it have a built in serial UART? Where did you copy-pasted the design? You just made my point Could you tell us the specifications? Transistor size, density, etc. What level of clean room is available to you? 100? Techniques used for lithography and masks.

I'm also intrigued by the code to hardware thing. I'd guess specialized hardware runs orders of magnitude faster as opposed to generalized ones. 

Would it be possible to make a chip for a particular time consuming program(say photo shop or matlab) making it much cheaper hardware wise if you wish to use it for a singular purpose. Making it sort of cartridges like which used to be case with nes video games making it impossible to pirate a software.

Also most of the specialized machines (SEM, TEM) we have run on way old computer software e.g. 95 and 98 as they don't invest in drivers for newer version of windows. Would it be possible to replace the controller of these machines with a single use computer.

Also is anyone working on quantum computing? People are trying to build it up from scratch so wouldn't it be better if we could jump on it. More like mobile revolution happened in India skipping the landline revolution. OP can you suggest me some resources on 8086. IWTL I have a genuine doubt about something being called 'indigenous'. What does it really mean? hope this captures diy market and helps developing prototype projects quickly Congratulations on your success. Even though i dont know anything about computers. But this looks interesting. Well done! Could this guy run Linux? What sort of I/O does it provide? (Ethernet, GPIO, I2C, etc) where is it manufactured?? Btw great job.  What’s with the name? Any chances for a cooler name that appeals to the millennials? Why the naming? It sucks so bad.. get a ambitious name atleast. First of all congratulations! Its great achievement.

Does it have its own Instruction set? Is it RISC or CISC? How come only a few newspapers and reddit will celebrate these achievements which come out of IITs and IISc ? This is awesome. Congrats. But, since you mentioned the “future,” I am wondering if you and your team are ready to bypass all patents for chip manufacturing. Eg. developed patentable creative way of developing it without interfering prior arts. 

I wonder why military can’t use foreign chipsets; maybe reverse engineering to make sure it does what it does would be sufficient enough and cost effective. How many masks were needed to fabricate this? How long will it take to launch it to market
And what more improvements are we looking at? can you please state the specs Is there a reference manual and a compiler?

What are the advantages of developing own microprocessor compared to picking up an ARM reference architecture and customizing it for your own requirements? How much cooling does it require? Is it passively cooled? Asking since the clock speed isn't something in Ghz.

&#x200B;

What kind of motherboard or accessories does it require to work? What about things such as RAM and other hardware controllers like storage or other things? (sorry if question isn't clear I'm not much of a Chip guy lol.) any chance of a micro controller/processor like arduino/rspbpi? with peripherals? Congrats! How long did the whole project take to reach up to this prototype? What's the power consumption of this prototype?

How do you come up with the Rs 100 estimate of mass produced cost?

What's the minimum feature size/technology node of the fab process for Ajit?

Do the power consumption and performance meet the envisioned use case for satellite deployment? Hiya OP, I'm glad you guys have done this, it's quite something, do you plan on building anything in the future for desktop grade architecture? Cheers! what is the ISA for this processor? are there any benchmarks? what architecture was used to produce this RISC or CISC..?? Yay Considering the many processors that are currently in the market, could you please tell us how this compares or rather how this is better? Could you also lay the difference in cost when comparing with other processors in the same category?

Now that this was fabricated in India where do you see the future of of microprocessor fabrication in our country?

EDIT: how would this compare to an ARM, raspberrypi and so on? Can we expect this to be commercially available for home projects? Can it run minesweeper What will be the benchmark processor if we wish to compare with other popular ones. ? Will this be commercialized, and actually be able to compete with processors by other big companies? Cost less than rs100 if produced on a mass scale? How much does a processor of same specs cost in the market? What is the assumed profit margin to your product? Does it work? What educational background do I need to join your team? Reading through all the comments and sub-comments, I can't help but wonder that this AMA is a supreme example of how an AMA should be. [deleted] Hi there,

I have a couple of questions (3 infact)

1. Why do we not have our own indigenous processors that compete with the likes of Giants like Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Exynos or Kirin? I mean its been so long, we have some greatest brains in our country.
2. Not offending anyone, but we could have probably reverse engineered the process or taken help from engineers who have previously worked for these companies. Why do we have to start from scratch? Why start from Mhz? Why not directly Ghz? (atleast 1 Ghz would be good. Enthusiasts would probably buy this instead of the Raspberry Pi and provide some funding to the research)
3. At this rate, how long do you think will it take to reach a competitive level in terms of the ""nm"" tech.? (Please don't say near future) Which programmable chip (I am assuming some FPGA) did you use for testing AJIT? I will try a HPC around it. Xilinx devkits are really good at combining softcores and provide an on-board ARM processor to build a complete embedded system where you can accelerate hardware and use ARM's existing computational capabilities. 1. How long did it take to complete the entire ASIC flow? 
2. Is there a spec sheet available? Im all in for indigenous technology..But don't you think we are bit too late in the processor making race. Even mobile processors have achieved GHz capacity with half a dozen parallel cores with integrated peripherals. Even if we catch up with the big players in the market, we will still need to build the ecosystem around it, do you think we can do that ? 

I agree this is just a start, we can use low frequency processors in a lot of military, industrial and household equipments - microwaves, washing machines, are you guys looking at a niche within that or is it going to be some heavy computing in future?

And, i kinda feel that government wants to make headlines with this, every government in india does that, how is their support in the long term ? 

Also, this is a very huge opportunity, it feels great to be a part of something this big. How is the diversity in the public institutions that support this kind of leg room in technological research ? Kudos Brother / Sister. :) Hearty congratulations on your Achievements

Brutal Question
Do you plan to implement a secret CPU running inside the processor which has complete remote access, similar to Intel's **Management Engine** or AMD's **TrustZone**?

If not how would you takle pressure from government authorities in case it is mandated. Benchmarks pls Reading AJIT on that chip triggers me because of AJIT PAI. 

Nonetheless, Kudos for this achievement OP and his team. Can it run crysis? Hi, I am so interested in designing microchips and processors. Being part of a team that develops such products is so awesome! I am currently on my way to enter Mtech VLSI in one of the NITs. Can you suggest some essential tools/skills that'll help me to get into such industry? I am from electronics background and circuits have always fascinated me. Wrong, IIT Madras developed 'SHAKTI' processor in Nov 2018 Looks like arc reactor from Ironman 2 (it's square instead of triangle). One question though, how is it different from other processors in the market (despite it would be produced in India) and are we planning to mass produce it here? And congratulations, this marks a success!! I initially thought, it was a carom board. Well done! When will it be mass produced? So you started from wafer level? How did you get all the etching done? That's a very nice and insanely costly thing to have to just make one chip, isn't it? Any plans to build GPUs? u/prabot kudos on the success. I had a query. What is the socket/pin description for AJIT? Wasn't Shakti the first one???
Please correct me if I'm wrong. How many nanometers? Can it compete with STM 32? What architecture is it? Is it a new one? Comparable with STM 32? Architecture? Btw wasn't riscv based shakti released before your processor? All I see is that you're going for the embedded market, but every story I read describes the AJIT as a microprocessor. Are you planning on making a microcontroller with this architecture or is it meant to be a processor only?

I mean a 32bit 100MHz uC for approx 2usd would be sweet, although I don't, from a marketability standpoint, understand why you went with the sparc v8. I guess licensing ARM would render the chip too expensive.

I'm going to stick with AVR and ARM for now, but I wish you good luck with the AJIT. Does it do the needful? PAPA ne nahin bola sharma ji ka beta is in Intel making 10nm processors /s Show bobs and vagna RISC V ARCH I Guess ? what does it run?, what architecture is this? , what's the benchmark? 
any link to such details would be appreciated.

Nice work though. Will there be any requirement of operating system / kernel developer ? 
What will be Applications ? I'm really intersted in learning this stuff (designing processors / how processors work) do you have any book recommendations? But can it run Crisis? Do you hope to rival other processor manufacturers such as intel and AMD in their processing power? Or aiming to excel above their standards? Would you say that the price would be similar or cheaper? And final question, would you also manufacture a cooling system that best suits this new processor that is both light weight and highly efficient? If so you got my complete support! Is nanotechnology a buzzword or will it make an impact? Thank you for sharing this!  Just curious why choose C and not C++ Oh wow to my gaming mind that looked similar to  pc processor lol, but im still amazed and hopefully this will be the technological boost needed to push india into the forefront of technological development can it be used as raspberry pi for learning. if yes will it be commercially available at a cheaper price than pi? Can I play Skyrim with it? I Salute you anyway. Where do you see India in the next 10 years in this particular field ? Are there any mega plans or vision policy that the government has regarding this? How are we doing on the theoretical front of it ,as in what is the original research output that we are generating ? How does it compare to Intel and AMD cpus? What's your JEE score /s Following the Moore's always we will be reaching the current configurations of CPU's around 20 years from now OP ? Or shorter. But still this is amazing, I have seen the productions lines, and it seems hella crazy, so much precision, care and methods. Great Work !! Can it run Crysis? How is this different (or better) than other silicon based processors from silicon valley? I'm curious @prabot do you work at powai labs ? Will it still follow Moore's law ? :) Congratulations from IIT Kharagpur. Even though this is much slower than Industry standard processors around the world.  
I'm still proud of this achievement done in India. Hopefully our government will start funding more towards this. I'm not a technical guy, but, is there a possibility that the project can, sometime in future, be scaled up into a motherboard that can go into laptops made in India for Indian market? I'm sick of people always bragging about how electronics are cheaper overseas and the lengths to which people go to save $100 on their laptops by asking their overseas cousins to get mobiles and laptops for them. I'd really like to see laptops and other electronics developed in India and being cost-competitive with the rest of the world. All of the following question are on ELI5 level :

1.) Can you do a comparison of your processor and i3/i5 .

2.) Can processors be reverse engineered? how hard is to reverse engineer a processor.

3.) Who are the giants in the field of processors research/R&D.

4.) What are the key obstacles in the development of processors.

5.) What kind of equipments are needed to manufacture your product? are these machineries available/produced in india? what machineries are required to mass produce your product. Also, what's the cost of manufacturing your product (say 10,000 processor)

6.) why it took so many years for india to produce a processor while companies like intel is selling it to millions?

7.) I see in every few month a more developed processor is launched (i3 ----> i5 ----> i7)  why is that they couldn't able to produce the current version few months ago? how come they weren't able to produce it then but just after 6 months they can produce it now.

8.) What's the highest potential of current processor technology? 

9.) I have heard about quantum processors, are they the next generation of processors? how different is the quantum processor technology to the current processor technology?

10.) If you had a superconductor, what effect would you have on your processor/ or in the world of processor? What programming language did you the most? ARM? He's answered only 2 questions by my count and they were pretty softball ones. Pack it up boys. This is starting to look like the Arnoob Goswami AMA. Propaganda at its finest. I wonder if this processor even exists or if it's just another fabrication of the government propaganda? Heard that it is based on havard architecture instead of von Neumann. Why is that? [removed] I thought SHAKTI was India’s first microprocessor. Does it run `gcc`? Could you tell me why some of the brats from IIT are so arrogant? Bet it works as well as testicles in a pc Wow! Salute to the guy who made India proud! Does it have a toilet ? Kitna deti hai?? Why does India make it so hard to do business with other countries? Non tech guy here. Is this chip a mobile processor? I hope and believe if Indians would finally stop leaking their top talent to other countries and find a way to implore them to staying there. I feel extremely bad how all the incredible talent that our nation generates leaves and ends up fighting to find a way to find citizenship in an another country as opposed to leading our own to greatness. 

I am one of them and I feel ashamed of that fact every day.

Hopefully one day I can return and pride myself for being Indian.. 

#JAIHIND Can it run Crysis? Why would I want to use yours over lets say a core i9 or ryzen 7? Do you plan on competing with them in the kind of tasks they do? i.e. mainstream processing",AMA,2019-04-22 01:47:50

*This is just an announcement. The AMA thread will be posted by the guest at 2 PM tomorrow.*


",kash_if," This is huge. Well done! Good one Mods! 
Please someone ask her what her plans for entire India would be like in education, as I may not be online around that time.  Very cool and epic Would there be a chance to ask our questions prior to the start? Time constraints here make it hard to be online at that time. okay that's nice. Do kejriwal next please noice! well done mods Great job mods. Here are two of my questions in case I don't make it online then:

1. A recent survey showed that 65% of government schools in Delhi are without principals. While the government says the matter is with the LG, how do we make sure children and their studies are not impacted?

2. Delhi is a city notorious for its women safety issues. There are still a lot of boys-only and girls-only government schools in the city. What are your thoughts on such schools? Do you think the government can do more in enabling better, healthy relationship between both genders from a young age? Wow. Amazing.

RemindMe! 14 hours  My questions to Atishi:

1. AAP has done wonderful work in primary education. What is your vision for professional and higher education?
2. In view of the looming threat of AI taking over most lower level jobs in about a decade, what is your vision for education which will make students employable in the future? Why is the Marlena last name suddenly getting dropped everywhere? This is GRAND! This is so huge. Good work!!!  u/kash_if where is the AMA post? Woah. This is great!! Looking forward to it. [deleted] Will you become the Education Minister of India in a future coalition government?  To Atishi 


1. What changes does India need in higher education, professional courses?


2. What freedoms should parents provide their children to develop as a better person?


3. Does the super costly schools(where mostly the very rich study) teach something unique that is a challenge to bring to the government schools?


4. What do you do when you are not working for education or advising AAP?


5. What message do you want to give to the youth in their 25 to 35 years of age? Continue working, take courses? anything you want to say


6. What are your long term plans for education if you keep doing what you are doing for a decade or more?


7. Is the AAP government working on any promising long term solution for pollution? Are the kids motivated to take charge?

8. Have you been approached by any other state or center to do your work at a larger scale? We would love to have you India's HRD Minister. If AAP pushes your name as HRD minister - you might actually get support from other parties and wider constituents. Best of luck for Lok Sabha elections. Shit

4. Do you use algo trading? If yes, how did you learn to code and what books have you read to be good at algo trading?
5. How do you maintain your cool when you incur a big loss on a bad day? 
6. Can you tell us more about your daily lifestyle? Your routine etc. Seems like you beat u/risingsteam 's allegation from the last year post that you were just a lucky orangutun.

> ""I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.

  


> Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.

  


> Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over $1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would have been won.

  


> By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably write books on “How I turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet, they’ll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors with, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”

  


> By then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much the same — 215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips."" Kudos on crossing 1cr on trading. I have a couple of questions for you.

1. What got you into trading in the first place. Any insight into your background?

2. What was the learning curve involved.
How did you reach where you are right now? Can you break it up into the skills (and necessary sources) and other resources needed to start off? How did you start learning. How can begginers learn to do this. Thanks for the AMA. 

1. Is this your full time job or you do it part time?
2. How many days of the year you work in one year?
3. How many hours you spend per day? How much capital do you need to start with to make investing your full time job ? So that one can live off the profits and doesn't need to do other jobs to earn a living. What’s your basic strategy - Momentum trading , special situations ? Also did you ever calculate your sharpe ratio. 

Congrats on hitting 1cr hope you make 10x out of it ! Congratulations. wow! do you recommend any book a beginner can get. 1. Do you hold stock positions for more than one day if the position is making loss on that day? 
2. Whats your average trade size? Like, how many RIL shares will you buy in one go before squaring it off?
3. which sectors are your favourite? I burned my hands trying to stay invested in auto stock Biggest loss amount? What are your most common trading instruments? Do you think mutual funds is a good investment strategy ? Between real estate and mutual funds which would you pick ? do you trade as an individual or have you set up an LLC or something?  Can you spill some secrets on how to win in intraday? I’ve made a few thousands trading but mostly I am holding long because I can’t win consistently in intraday. What strategy should I use? Also, which TA tool is the best? I personally use only BB, RSI and MACD. What would you recommend to a person who wants to get into it and maybe pursue trading as a side business while studying? How much tax have you paid on the CG? ever get stuck with an intraday short you could not cover by EOD? What's your age and when did you started intraday trading? I don't want you to dispense any misconceptions my way. I've enough of my own, thanks. [deleted] Can you give a short introduction on how to start trading and where to start, what books to read, sites you recommend and scams to avoid, for a noob like me. I don’t understand leverage in stock market did you use technical analysis?
if not, please describe your strategy. I dont have any spare money.

How can I get started with this? Intra day trader! I actually don’t believe in technicals, charts don’t work. That’s why most of the intra day traders don’t make it. But the people look at the candles and what not and still make money. May be it works but I just can’t bring myself to believe it does. Congrats to you though for making lots of money! Congrats I want to start trading too, what are the formal procedures(bank accounts etc) to get started and how to choose a broker.
Also suggest the simplest way to get started Few questions : 
a) What percentage of your trade are Intraday ? 
b) How long on an average are your non intraday trades ?
c) if there are 10 metrics you measure for making a buy/sell call what are those ? would love to know some of the statistics on your trades. especially win/loss ratio, number of trades. I am en engineer by profession and would like to explore the world of trading. I have absolutely 0 knowledge on the subject. I just read you recommending Rupee tales by Zerodha. Any Youtube channels instead? Thanks for the AMA. I have always looked down upon trading as everyone I know lost their money in the market (my dad, my mama etc). I am in a comfortable place in IT right now and I can take a bit of the risk with my money. Please know that I know absolutely nothing about trading.

I see you recommend zerodha varsity. But the question is, can one start with capital as small as 1 lakh? Just to test the waters? Would you recommend intraday trading for a guy with a regular 9 - 5 job? I feel there are two knowledge components: one is understanding the technical stuff like what is a short. 

The other part is following the industry - daily news and analysis which allows you to make informed decisions. What sources do you recommend for this?

What is your view on Zerodha smallcases? I don't have the time to trade intraday. Is it viable to make money through swing trading over a few days? Kind of a stupid question. Which brokerage firm do you use for trading? Who provides the best online platform for trading in India? WoW. Congrats Manu vai. Have you tried your hand at CryptoCurrency trading? Or at least ever held any Crypto? When should a person start investing and how much of his income should he invest and where to get decent profits and stable passive income. I am a beginner and am interested in concept of dividend funds, are they helpful in the long run? How you do you differentiate between a pull back and a reversal? Which technique do you rely on?
Technical, fundamental or quantitative? [deleted] 1. Do you stay alone? Or with your parents?
2. If you live with family, what do they think of your work? Do you have your setup in a room?
3. Do you sell naked OTM puts? So I am someone with high risk appetite and have a few lacs that I want to invest (or rather I want to experiment with). But I don't want to do intraday trading full time, so what goals should I set myself? Also, do you mainly invest on stocks or do you bet on macroeconomic aspects as well? For professionals who dont have time but still want to have a investment going in stocks ,what would be your best advice...?
Also how much return should i realistically be looking for.
I have few investments with bluechip and as per their advice ,have invested in few mutual funds.
Should i do anything differently.? If I can spare a decent amount of capital, what would you recommend as my starting reading material? 

In no hurry to make quick money 1) Which software you are using?
2) How many people you have hired?
3) How you keep check on greed and need of your investment?
4) what are the major complications in this business? I'm not 18 legally. But I started trading through my father this year. I turned 10K to 13.5K in March when I started, then bought ALBK. My father said I'm making too many trades. So I'm waiting till August to invest via my own account. I have a few questions, and anybody can answer them:

1. How do I invest 10K? There is no way I can increase my capital or whatever 10K is. I really want to trade and learn the craft.

2. Which online broker should I use?

3. How do I stay on top of the news? Wanted to understand about your technique. These signals that you talk about, they automatically which means you are using an API? Which brokers provide a good set. Also, any of them provide intraday volumes as well along with price? Investing is mostly going against the tide (buy stocks with bearish sentiments) whereas trading is going with the tide (follow market sentiments).  
How much do you agree with the above statement? So you are telling us all you had more than 200% annualised returns thats more than 2 bps per trade on average assuming you made fewer than 10,000 trades(Thats is an already an absurdly large number of trades)!!! Wow!!!

That is so unbelievable I don't even believe you :/

But hey man fair play to you if its true. I think you would be among the most successful trader of all time. Do you believe in technical analysis? Especially in intraday trading. Hi Manu, I am regular 24 year old with a job that doesn't allow me to day trade. However, i'd still like to get started with investing: trading, funds and other financial instruments to supplement my income. Where can I start? Are there any courses you would suggest?

I do not mind paying for training on how to invest. I only ask that it fits into my lifestyle, and doesn't require me to invest multiple hours at end. Hey man, late to the party. NRI swing trader here and what you're doing is beyond my ultimate dream so I have a few questions for you.

1. Did you test your strategies on international markets (like on demo accounts). I'm curious if it's work on NASDAQ and NYSE

2. Do you place both long and short positions or just long?

3. It's a very bullish market. If I had invested in almost any tech stock a year ago, I'd have doubled my money. What makes your strategy stand out?

5. Did your position size get bigger as your account grew or did you always trade with same size.

4. Any tips to make 2% a week? just couple days ago was thinking about you wondering where are you right now. and bamm here you are. Would you say that to trade successfully it needs to be a full-time job? Meaning someone occupied 10 hours every day in another job can't possibly spare the time to learn the right information. This is some WSB level shit. You are quoting 30% returns as predictable in your comments. It’s all fun and games when we are in a 10 year bull market but I feel bad for the idiots who’re going try this and lose everything!

Yeah I made a killing betting on tech stocks over the past two years but I’m not stupid enough to claim my intelligence had anything to do with it. I'm not from a business/engineering background. Got no idea about trading but know that starting early is better. I'm already in my early 20s. What do I do? How do I start investing with minimal income? What will be your advice to someone who doesn't know anything about trading but wants to make money of it. How do I start? Would you do an AMA after you lose your money too? Hey congrats question do you keep tight Stop-loss for your strategy means in terms of profit in percent how much is your stop-loss for each trade? Have you ever thought increasing capital impacts return of your strategy due to slippage? Hello friend. I am learning for investing into stock I am learning by watching youtube videos. Can you guide what would be a better way to learn more into investing stocks? Background: I used to work for a large hedge fund in a technology role. The hedge fund employed quantitative strategies in addition to a large array of research analysts.

I have been trading on my own for more than a year. I have had some great profits, and great losses.

I wrote this for all those who think they can make quick money in the market by choosing a security and choosing a time and direction. Listen up.

You are an uninformed trader. You do not have any special information about the future which is not also available to the professionals.

All ""easy"" informed trading is done almost immediately by computers. An example is: stock A is at $10. There is new information which is clearly bullish. Within a second, the stock will be at $12. The new price reflects the new information. You cannot beat the computers at informed trading.

New ""complex"" information about an asset has to be analysed and accepted by others for it to be trade-worthy. You can not hope to be a better analyst than professionals who have training, tools and access to insiders. That doesn't mean all analysts are right or in agreement, but only that their opinion is more informed than yours. Again, you cannot hope to profit using analysis of ""complex"" information if the market doesn't agree with you. Reading a Seeking Alpha article (and the comments) is not analysis.

After the information is priced in, any further price movement is driven by supply-demand and not by new information. You cannot guess at supply-demand. It happens in real time and big traders fiercely protect the content of their future orders. I laugh at people who buy $TWTR AFTER getting the information that Jack Dorsey also bought some last week. There may be a sentiment rally if others start buying, there may not be. You really don't know.

Charting is useful only in hindsight. Prior price/volume action has no bearing on future price/volume action. You say pivot points? Let us say SPY is reaching 237.00 from above. Everybody says it is an important ""support"". What does that mean? Will it break that support or not? If it breaks, will it go much lower, or bounce back up to reclaim the support? Again, you don't know. Today SPY broke and bounced off that support 3 or 4 times before definitively breaking down. Which break-down is definitive? It is only clear in hindsight.

Now, all the above should make it clear that, in essence, you are an uninformed trader, that is, you are trading blind. That means, charitably speaking, that your chances of the asset moving in a favorable direction are 50-50.

But still you will lose. There are two reasons for this. One relates to the way trades happen, and other is about human psychology.

(a) If you place a limit buy or limit sell, your order will only execute while the ticker is moving unfavorably to you. 
  That is, if the stock is moving down from your limit buy price, your buy order will execute. And if it is moving up beyond your limit sell price, your sell order will execute. In each case (unless you are closing a trade), you are immediately at a loss as the price continues its movement.

( If the price is not moving much, you are immediately at a loss due to the bid/ask spread.  And you likely bought because you thought it was a bargain and the recent past showed a downward price movement and you were bullish on it.  More often than not, price movement continues in the same direction.  Reversals are rare and hard to time.)

This means, that

(b) You immediately are in pain. You see a loss and will likely see it widening as the price movement continues.

Now you have many options:

i) You can exit the trade at a loss. Bummer.

ii) You can execute another trade in the same direction to average your price. This again suffers from the same problem. The price is moving away from you while all your orders execute. Your new trade is as uninformed as the last one.

iii) You can hold the bag, ""hoping"" for a reversal.

Both in (ii) and (iii), you are now holding the bag.

Let us talk about that.

Usually, the price will continue to move while you see the red becoming redder. You regret the trade. You are stressed. You have averaged it 3, maybe 4 times already. You want to at least exit at break-even.

Therefore, as soon as the price reverses and it shows you a modest profit, you will itch to book the profit and relax. Hence, you will make the all-too-common (but understandable) trader mistake of holding your losers and quitting your winners. After the trade shows some green, because you have experienced the red, you will be afraid that it will again go red. You will be wanting to not go through that pain again.

Therefore you will usually see losers in your portfolio with a loss % of 20 or even 50, but you will never see that kind of profit %. Ever. You would have booked the profit at 2% or 5%.

So what's the consequence? Even assuming each trade has a 50-50 chance of going your way, your losses will always be bigger than your winners.

Eventually, you will curse trading and seek gainful employment.

Hope it was helpful.

 What about if you use stop limits with market orders and trade into ""momentum""? This can work, some of the time.  How do you determine that the momentum is going to continue and not reverse soon after?  But the main problem is the stops.  If you have a tight stop, volatility will take you out.  If you have a wide stop, your loss will be wide too.  Figuring out a proper stop based on ""pivot points"" and past realized volatility is not that straightforward, but it can work if enough other people believe in your pivot point too.

I still trade, but am a more humble trader after the experiences.  It is possible to develop an edge, but it takes specialized skills and hard work.

TL;DR: If you don't have a well-defined edge, you cannot hope to day trade for profit in the long term. Saar job milegi? When will you get a real job? [deleted]",AMA,2019-05-11 14:07:07

AMA.",182,bgsh11,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bgsh11/im_a_16lpm_elite_mba_who_cant_find_a_job_ama/,239,I graduated from one of the best b-schools of India. I did fairly well (top 20% of my batch) and got a good placement. But the company went bankrupt after 2 years. I've been looking for a new job for the last 3 months but haven't been able to find anything.,evilbombadil," A lot of times companies just don't process your resume after looking at your previous salary. This has been very apparent in software professionals who switched to a software job in a financial institution (jpmc, Nomura etc) and then left it. Is 1.6 lakh a decent salary for an elite MBA grad? Do you think number of jobs have decreased in the market now as compared to say 3 years ago? Hah 3 months is rich, took.me 6 to even get a job..... 

Hold tight man , it will come. Did you take education loan, if yes then how much, if no then what was your total kharcha for the MBA? As someone who is doing a job after BBA and is stuck between doing Papa ka business or making a career by myself. Is MBA worth the 20-30L of investment? I am 33 year old planning to do 1 year MBA from IIM A/B/C/L or XLRI. I am typical Indian IT male (IIM) with average academics. 

Reason for MBA: I am working in IT service industry for past 9 years and always intrested in learning and growing. But now my growth is staganat and only option is to get into Management. So why not get MBA Degree and jump state career as manager in IT.

Should I do MBA ? 

Keep looking buddy you will find the Job soon. Is it worth doing an MBA, if even without it you're earning that much within roughly 4 years of graduating? Vaguely related, but as a non Indian it has always wondered me why so many people start an MBA at such a young age in India. In the Netherlands (where I am from) it is considered very weird to do an MBA without having at least around 4-5 years of work experience. Combined with the fact that most people enter the workforce here at a later age as well results in most people taking their MBA while being in their late 20s/early 30s. And isn't that the original purpose of an MBA anyway, to do it only after having a decent amount of experience (but I might be misguided here)? It's been tough, but while searching for new openings I hope you're also enjoying this free period while it lasts ( hope it doesn't last too much though).  
   
Btw apart from the money you made, you regret anything about the professional world of the elites? What job role were you doing? Which location are you looking for? MBA in what?
I may be able to refer you if something matches. will you work in a company that would pay 20%-30% less than your previous pay? Among HR, marketing and finance if you had to pick one which would you select based on the demand? Was the company a startup? Campus placement? Can relate to this situation. Hope you land a good job!   
Incase you are looking for some leads, do DM. We are hiring in my team. Need good finance knowledge. How/Why did your company go bankrupt? At what age did you get your job at 1.4 lakhs pm ? What was your CAT %ile/GMAT? (Optional :P)

Do you regret taking a niche job instead of consulting/IB etc. ?

Does your academic history before MBA matter much after MBA? Why did it fail? And what do you think the founders/management could have done differently to save it? What would have you done? 

Also, is the product still 'out there'? I feel joy in reviving past/broken/failed products, if only money was a constraint. alumni help nahi karta ? [deleted] Bhai, when i read your story, I had to check whether I had posted it myself. Only difference is I was fired for factors within and without my control. I had taken this unemployment thing a bit lightly - my company gave me three months time to find another job. The first month went with a flurry of interview from good companies - flunked them all since I was under prepared and tensed.
The second month, I took a step back, started reading and playing PUBG. I am now in the third month and have recently started applying. You situation seems to have added a sense of urgency now and thank you for that. I am currently not too worked up since I have the finances to pay off the loan and live unemployed for quite a few months at home.

However the prospect of continued unemployment is now looking a bit worrisome. I have started working on constructive habits such as waking up at 6:00 AM, meditating, exercising - key habits that have let me down in the past and hopefully will help me in the future. I am more concerned how my parents will react  - I haven't told them yet. 

Any help in this regard will very helpful. It's unclear if you ""can't find a job"" because of being picky about offers or because you haven't gotten an offer.   
Either way, your asset is the network, not the degree. Check your college email ID for job leads. Post on your alumni telegram and whatsapp groups, preferably also the city group and not only the batch group. And spend less time on reddit till this is over.  


Source: Am a 1.6lpm ""elite"" MBA who can find a job any week of the month 1.6lpm on paper or in hand? 

Any previous experience prior to MBA? 
MBA in what? 

PM me your resume, will refer in my company if I like it. Salary shouldn't be a problem if you are good. First of all sorry for your situation. Have you tried working in start ups for stocks rather than huge salary? The reason I am asking this is because, I am from a similar B school and initially I worked in a small start up for gaining experience. With just a 5 minute video, I want you to help me understand with real examples about what you studied in MBA and what type of things you do on job.

Because a lot of people say ""Bro become a software developer they earn 2.3lpm"" but very few people talk about the annoying and nerdy codes they write for hours. What about job referrals through buddies? Beyond a point depending on recruiters doesnt make sense... especially if you are in 1.6lpa bracket. Dear OP,
Please tell me which area of business you want to work in - Ops, Analytics, HR, Finance or Strategy. If you wish it so, I can help you with a referral at my current org, provided there are matching opportunities and you are also similarly inclined.
Thanks. Get to Bangalore, make a list of 50 companies and walk into their offices with a flower bouquet and 2 senior contact names. Ask to meet them and ask for a job.

&#x200B;

Two companies per day and in four weeks, you will have atleast a dozen leads. Is your salary expectation a factor? Are you Lord of the rings fan? What did you major in before your MBA? I hope you won't mind answering 

I am doing btech rn in a relatively new field (biotechnology) I have absolutely no interest in research and would like to get into a corporate job.
How exactly should I plan my career?
I am planning on finishing my degree, get a job, leave it after a year or two and get an MBA and get back to the corporate world.

Also, have you tried getting a job abroad? Hey Bro! There are lots of referral groups on WhatsApp and other social media for Top MBA college students. You can try subscribing to those. A lot of my friends having your mentioned salary switched jobs using these groups. Okay. Prepared for the down-votes so here goes. Sorry bout your situation, but this is only the start of an epidemic. Our gen needs to wake up from this MBA gold rush. Working as an AI programmer, I can bet my balls this is a trend that will grow exponentially in the coming years.

Management is a dead industry. Why? Cause A.I! Management is part of occupations that you can  term 'pseudo-expertise'. When a $12/month EC2 cluster can be trained to make the same decisions as you why would I expend 40L/year? That's just reality and the sooner we get with it the better.

Jolkien Rolkien Rolkien Tolkien approves [It's Mohanlal Karamchand Gandhi according to Mudiji.](https://youtu.be/LjT4y8Xs-Ls) The biggest clown ever to come out of Indian News Media.  Arnab Goswami first gets a high quality induction heating plate on his chair, switches it on and then the camera starts rolling. Even if his ass shits bricks, it's hot shit.

EDIT: This seems irrelevant and petty objection by altnews, but now the jingoists have to choose between BMKJ and Ambedkar, neither of which they can sacrifice to appear populist. He has proven himself a incompetent on multiple occasions 

At the time of ama on r/india. He was not able to answer questions which he was supposed to do.

He is a sellout. Evidence you demand well its his entire channel. Funded by rich and powerful. Best source of biased news.
 
He is not a news anchor but a loud and violent speaker. Man I wonder how much decibels can he generate?

INDIA WANTS TO KNOW!

Well I want to know how can he make mistake at something so basic.

 Now this is news ? good thing he did not call him narendar. I am sure that day will come too.

Can someone on his panel ask him to sing vande mataram on live tv? Arnab @$utiya hai! This is why I call every great figure in history, 'John Cena'. >Mohanchand Karamdas Gandhi

FTFY When he's had to relearn ""real"" Indian history, what else can the poor fella do? /s Just look at his stupid face. Whenever life feels sad I watch this clown and feel better Well he won't be able to say Benhandle Cucumberarch Nation wants to know who is Mohanchand Karamchand Gandhi?! cheaper alex jones Mohanlal 😂 ... #bharathmatakijai? Is republic the fox of india? What is the sub's opinion on Gen GD Bakshi?   


I personally feel glad he isn't involved in decision-making of any manner when it comes to foreign policy or we'd have been the mutation of Iran and N Korea by now. And I have seen a lot of criticism his way being deflected away cuz he's in the Army and 'been there..served there' narrative always comes into the  picture. he shouldn't get a pass on criticism just cuz he serves in the armed forces I would love to see this cry baby when Modi is booted out of power Modi syndrome Arnab is the poor man's Alex Jones. Not as good cause Alex Jones can actually be entraining. Arnab just parrots what he knows what his audience will jerk off to If Arab shift delete  Just because of these stupid i have forgot his actual name, damn confusing!! Changing ""names"" is his masters favorite hobby, he's only following his master. This should come in tommorow's satya show. I didn't go through the article but is it that uncommon for a name to me said lil bit wrong, doesn't matter it's a famous one or not.

Is it because the person concerned is Gandhi?

EOD it's a name and we are humans,isn't mispelling common for us.
 Oh My God. Arnab said Mohanchand instead of Mohandas. 

What a travesty. What have they done to the media. What a fall in standards. Why isn't this on the front page of all the newspapers. ",AMA,2018-08-25 12:24:02
Before and after my Opti-LASIK procedure in Bangalore. Right eye -4 sph and -2.50 cyl. Left eye -5 sph and -2.25 cyl. AMA,177,bae2ym,https://i.redd.it/auysrkb2ssq21.jpg,311,,_hein_," Is the blue mask free or did you pay extra for it?  I think people r not asking the important questions..
How many fingers am i holding up? ✌ How is the result? Any irritation in eye? Did anyone care about who you were before you put on the mask? [deleted]  glasses gone Swag mode on 😁 What did the doctor say about the long term effects ? I'm too thinking of doing LASIK but I've heard in most cases eye sight gets dull again after a few years. Thanks for posting, this has been very informative for someone planning on getting lasik. lasik se tum gori ho gayi ho..

&#x200B;

/s [deleted] I got this procedure done 3 years ago. AMA Can cylindrical correction be fixed via Lasik? How does it feel being a girl on r/india ?  How many DMs you have got till now? Did your office cover it? Or personal expense? How much vision did you get back. ?

I got 90% back.

&#x200B; Has this boosted your confidence? And do people act differently around you since you no longer wear glasses?  How many years did you wear glasses for? It sounds weird but I've worn glasses for half my life and I feel like it'll be weird to get used to not having them (though I'd love to not be dependent on them all the time) Do you think not having glasses now has changed your personality in some ways? I got mine done in 2013, I wonder how much has changed since then. I have the same power. Can you give me your specs? lol my brother got a lasik recently, now he is the hot one. So you got your surgery done and doctors advised to avoid screen exposure and here you are hosting AMA. Good god, lady, go and sleep. LASIK gang hi5. Got it done 3yrs back. Was -6.

Also, I got cooler shades after the procedure. Huh!  Exact procedure name? 

Hospital?

Total cost?

Totally corrected or you still need glasses? [deleted] What is the cost of the treatment?  Why do you look more excited before surgery than after it though? Btw was your vision stable for a few years? How long did the full procedure take? Is LASIK risk free?  I get anxiety thinking I might lose my sight. Did insurance cover your surgery? How have you adjusted to your non glasses look? Did you asked your doctor about PRK? If so did he recommended it? Damn. I feel like a retard. People are asking question while I'm scratching my head because I didn't understand the post itself Did you have astigmatism? I’d like to correct my vision, but apparently I’m not a good candidate because of astigmatism.   Getting lasik done was one of the best decision of my life. it's been five years now. Having thick specs throughout school added to my introversion and social anxiety and kind of made me waste a lot of years under insecurities. after lasik, being active was easier, not needing to pick up glasses first thing in morning was a big big freedom. somehow it helped me become a better person. I won't say I'm completely free of social anxiety but with better confidence its easier to handle life.  

Today I and everyone have forgotten that I ever wore glasses. I don't have any photo from my school life.  but every once in while I still think about the freedom lasik got me and I feel grateful for being able to see clearly.

Enjoy the freedom and take care of your eyes.  Just when I thought of getting LASIK done, this AMA comes up. Good thing to be honest. I'm trying to get  Contoura Vision Eye Surgery which also is a type of LASIK. My question is how many days did the doctor advice you to not look directly at the sun or any bright objects? I mean how many days after you can return to your normal life style, job, using computer etc.? Opti-Lasik made you cool ..will hit on right girl for sure I am 17 with -7.2 vision. Reading this thread is a huge relief. Thank you. It's cool that the doctors changed ur dress and pumped some protein in u for no extra cost AMA? 

PM me your phone number.  Don’t mean to be rude but what’s the point of this? Why is their a advertisement in that washroom?
Is that your office or what?  Is their any risk? 

On the side note, how did you manage to be so skinny?  How long has your prescription been stable? I think I have similar power and was looking at Lasik, did they inform you of the risks? If the surgery goes wrong, do you just go blind? Your top matches you bag/jacket or whatever it is you’re holding or it’s just a dirty mirror? :P Hey! my girlfriend is planning to get it done, I am a little bit concerned about it. Is there anything she must know about the procedure, apart from the usual that you can't be out for a month?  Is there a minimum power for which the surgery takes place? How old are you?what's minimum age requirement? Hi, how much time does it require to recover
I am planning for one, but will have work commitments  Which phone is that?  Can you also tell us what was your power last year and a year before last year? 

I wanted to get LASIK done to my eyes this year, my power was constant for last 2-3 years and just this year it decreased to -4.5 from -5. Doctor said to wait for one more year.  Total cost and recovery time? So, for how long you will be away from work??  I can't tell the difference in your eyes, though I do notice that you're wearing completely different clothing, different eye piece, changed hair style, are now wearing a backpack. What am I missing ? Is there any age limit/barrier to get this done? is it worth it?  I envy people who can get LASIK done. I’ve been waiting for a decade till I would turn 18 and when I did I was told that there’s risk that my retina might get detached again. Well I guess I’ll have to stick to contacts and specs for the rest of my life.  why Lasik why not SMILE eye surgery? I see most of your comments were 2 hours ago, so you'll probably not reply. Anyway. 

How do you avoid eye strain post surgery, seeing as screens are everywhere and I'm assuming you didn't take a vacation or a 'tech cleanse'(?)...?

Also, what's the best place to get some parathas in Bangalore.? what was the cost of opreation?? You became a Badass!
 Nice. Do you know if someone with higher order aberrations in their vision can get corrective surgery? Mine is -3 cyl left eye.. I was advised not to go for LASIK as my cyl power is high.. I am optimistic now looking at you . Someday! How much did it cost ? u/_hein_ ok i have some similar doubts, i also reside in Bangalore, do you have astigmatism on your left eye?, if so, is it in just one eye? 

i can see vertical double vision with just one eye closed on my right, meaning even if i close my left eye, it doesnt matter i can still see double, TEXT and right below it a shadow TEXT, i wanted to know if you also have the same problem and if did LASIK solve it, because i can't read properly as night arrives and can't read text on dark backgrounds, can't drive at nights as i can see everything twice from lights on street to vehicles that it gets annoying to drive at all at night.  So what are we suppose to do, look into her eyes? was the anesthesia  local or generalised? [deleted] Only one question. Why the AMA?  kiran rao? That neck though. Nobody fucking cares, go back to FB . 

Also, where's the proof, all I see is a selfie attagirl. you look big on the right(!)

I too had a LASIK 3 years back. Do follow 30-30-30 rule & keep your eyes moist!

I understand, it's not a very meaningful question, but one of my friends brought up this point, while I was praising how I liked Sacred Games because every element of the TV series was given quite a thought.

All i want to hear is what Varun has to say about how he got involved. All other's are just into shock doctrine type of stuff and a lot of copypasta from other shows. Congratulations on picking up a worthy material and giving Indian audiences something new. But having read the book I think the treatment could have been better and I would like to get your opinion on this. 

I feel a lack of connect with the characters, of course the major characters of Gaitonde and Sartaj have their backgrounds told so we understand their motives somewhat but what about Jojo, Mathur, Kanta bai and of course Parulkar sahab excellent actors all btw. I guess if we could have had a concept like in the show orange is the new black where all such characters had a side track running along with the main track. Taking audiences through their past through which we could understand and relate. 

Also a request I don’t think KD will come in the show but please please put him in one episode as a flashback or something, that guy has a potential for a tangent show all by himself.

We have recently launched PlutoX, an ultimate drone kit for makers and tinkerers on Indiegogo https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/plutox-the-ultimate-drone-kit-for-makers#/ and we have achieved 66% of our goal. AMA about drones and startup culture in India!",El_Impresionante," They had rigged the AMA it looked like. Made more sense to do it on r/India. Why would people outside care about ""IIT alumni""? ""Why are there so many new accounts in this thread?
"" Why do Indians on reddit never learn about how to do an AMA? Failure after failure after failure It's really quite amusing how he mentions that he is an IIT Alumni and CEO... Look man, we are all supportive of new startups but you gotta learn humbleness and how to sell an idea.

 Putting your background info on display instead of features and USP of product clearly shows that you lack confidence in your own product. Grade A chutiya. 

A genuine AMA would have been great for his company but no, this guy HAS to try (and fail miserably) to be a smart ass.

Guess cheating in exams (and life)is a life long trait.

Edit: For those who don't know, he or his minions created fake accounts to plant questions. As expected, he was caught and called out. It's a cringe fest out there.  https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9duvkq/i_am_ceo_of_drona_aviation_startup_of_nanodrone/e5ku49n/

> Commenter: When will the machines rise up?

> AMA IIT CEO: I am not sure. But I sure hope to live to see that day.

> Commenter: Oh shit you’re a super villian aren’t you

> AMA IIT CEO: Still in a nascent stage. One major tragedy required to convert me into a full fledged super villain.

Was this AMA enough, guy? LOL! How do you if someone is from IIT? They tell you in the first sentence lol. Wow... it is very interesting to see people commenting on my AMA in an entirely separate group. I am that CEO from the AMA.  


Of the many things said here, people have criticized the ""waving of IIT tag"". There were two reasons for that:  
1. People don't trust that we can build good products out of India and they necessarily have to come from US / China / other countries. We hope to change that by bringing a product from India to the world.  
2. This product was designed in labs of IIT Bombay. This is our way of giving the due credit to the institute.

&#x200B;

Could we have worded it better? Absolutely. What was good however was that people asked some very relevant questions about drones globally, drones in India and industry in general and I really enjoyed answering them.  


I appreciate this thread and the AMA, especially because:  
1. It showed us how passionate people are on Reddit  
2. Good learning on what mistakes to avoid on the platform. failing how ? anyone here into drones? can you recommend me one? Just went through the thread. Too much technical jargon. Anybody care to explain the cringe? Thanks! ",AMA,2018-09-08 03:18:37

My parents started searching for a bride when was 25. When rejections started coming in, I gave up. It was again started when was 28-29. Same story. After 34, I and my parents, gave all hope. 

recently I read a comment here, even if you are single etc, your parents will get you married. Well, not all the time.

edit: comments are not appearing again. #RejectedByRedditToo",kaju_badam," What do you look for in a partner? 

What do you think is your best trait?

Any instances where you've felt lonely? How did you deal with it?  Hum kaale hain toh kya hua, apna time ayega Get an escort ? There shouldn’t be any taboo since we are all spending money for company, in one way or another  One of my earlier rejection stories:

After finishing engineering, I had to be at home for almost 2.5 years before I got the offer letter. Almost everyone who got hired with me, had their jobs delayed. (This was like 15 years back).

Anyways, I was really excited about the job and I was in training where I saw this beautiful lady in the same class. I had this instant crush, but no balls to walk up to her to talk. I did not really know it was called as 'dating', but you would just ask them for coffee at CCD and it meant that only. Or you would write a letter and give them. 

So, training was for 3 months and 2.5 months had already passed. Once training is done, you can be posted anywhere. Also, back then I used to be enthusiastic at trying atleast lol. 

At that day when the class finished, I walked behind her and said 'excuse me'. Which she didn't hear (or pretended to not to hear). I had to repeat and shout a little, when she stopped. She looked back and making an annoyed expression of what do you want. At this point, mera poora phat gaya tha. For couple of seconds, I didn't know what to say. I stammered and said something like do you want to have coffee. She got so angry and threw her water bottle at me. I have no idea why she did that. Then she said, do you even know who I am etc etc and asked me to get lost. 

That's it. Next two days, I avoided my training classes (which were mandatory). Later, training finished and I never saw her again.

can share more, but my comments are not appearing. Did you ever take any steps to improve yourself to better sell yourself or put yourself out there? why didnt you do a quick bangkok trip? Dude, I feel for you. I'm just like you too. **M, 33, textbook virgin.** Never hand held any girl. Kissing a girl is in my bucket list. Have been too coward, poor and clueless to afford high class (safe) hooker. My parents have given up on me long ago and all my younger siblings are married now.  What's the point of having an AMA if you don't answer any of the questions?  I think you should get a dog for now. Who knows what the future might hold. Maybe the good boi could become your wingman. It's ok dude. Marriage is not everything in your life. Save enough for your retirement and have emergency funds. Focus on increasing your networth and enjoy your bachelorhood.  Am posting this without reading any of the other comments. There's two options you got:

1. If you MUST, find someone who NOBODY else wants to marry. A nice human being who would appreciate you for who you are. A widow or a differently abled person. And you may find love. 
2. Focus on your career and making, saving, and investing as much money as you can. And health of course. Then fuck bitches and whores (budget for it). 

The second option is my recommendation. Relationships are overrated; dont get into one and for fucks sake dont make little people. Fuck that shit; live for yourself. 

Building great friendships is more satisfying and fulfilling than chasing shitty ass romantic relationships. 

And learn to rock that shit; not everybody is handsome and attractive... with the right attitude, you can make ugly awesome! I would rather have an ugly but awesome friend than hang out with a handsome looking asshole.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B; I think your parent's social connection are weak, because there are many girls like you who desperately wants to marry someone and initiate normal family life, it's that you don't have reach to them (socially). The standard get rich/go to gym suggestions are silly. If that was the case more than half the men wouldn't get laid. I suggest the following:

1. This is also a failure of your social circle - your friends and family. Change who you hangout with. Make new friends. They have a responsibility to help you - remind them.

2. Most of my relationships started in *activites*. Badminton, board games, book clubs, cooking lessons etc. Find some activities and slowly improve your social skills. Even if there are only guys, they have friends and sisters they'll hook you up with.

3. Change your location. I don't know where you currently are but it's clearly not your destined place. Move to Goa or Himachal or a big city or even a different part of your current city.

 [deleted] You can go for hookers but the STDs are scary though. Not to offend you  but

What do you think is unattractive about you? Is it your physique, your expectations, or are you just ugly? (again, as a not so good looking guy I want to empathize your struggles and maybe share how you can improve)

What specific actions did you take to become desirable? Like did you start hitting the gym, wearing good clothes, being confident etc. ?

I'm 100% sure you can't be that repulsive ( Unless you have a physical disability..still its not 100% impossible). I would say maybe your standards are too high? 

Not to be condescending, because I'm going down this road and I think we should try to change our lives for the better :) Have u hit the gym to look fitter? Have you clothed smartly to show nice personality? Have you given helping hand to someone in need? Have you tried being part of office parties?

If answer to all these is yes - sanyaas le lo, kuch nahi honewala.

If answer is no - your parents should've belted your ass. *When rejections started coming in, I gave up*

Why so many rejections? Have you objectively analysed? 1. (Are you) / (Were you ever) interested in finding someone? 

2. Did you ever like somebody and actually approached them?  I am afraid I am seeing myself in you. 

But how do you hold up with your collegues? 

Do they also ignore/disrespect/avoid you?

Do you feel dumb sometimes because of not being able to hold conversations? I like how so many people are suggesting trips to Amsterdam or Bangkok or sex workers as if OP asked for advice on how to get sex  This is pretty interesting to me, both academically and personally. My questions:

What's your current occupation?

Did your parents look for a match ""below"" your status?

How is meeting all the relatives at weddings and parties like?

Have you come to terms with being a virgin loner for until some more time, or maybe even forever?

How is your mental health? Any signs of depression? Self harm? Addictions? Suicidal tendencies?

Do you smoke cigarettes? Drink regularly? Any hard drugs?

What are your religious views? Do you follow any particular philosophy of life?

I have a few more but would wait to see if you answer these. How are you now mentally? Did you have any kind of trauma growing up? Come friend, I will give you dosti wala lip kiss! How much porn do you watch? Never thought about hookers?  Are you happy? Have you found things in life that are fulfilling and meaningful? What are your hobbies? Remember you are a strong beautiful independent man that don't need no woman except Kali Maa. Your worth is not tied to how attractive women may or may not find you. I hope you're in a happy place emotionally speaking.  I mean unless you are physically deformed, I refuse to believe anyone is so ugly as to never get laid. A year of gymming, a decent haircut and some good clothes can go a long way [removed] In India, it is not at all a tough task to get married. All you need is money, are you well stuffed in that department ?  3 years till you become a Wizard. Me 10 years to go.

Ignore above congrats you are Wizard Harry. Apparently you become a Wizard at 30 for bring sexless  Why not lower your standards? Unattractive females with similar awkwardness? My two cents. If you are looking to get married search for girls of age just touching 35 because the social pressure would be enormous plus the age number will also add to it. Have you tried looking for a divorce or widowed girl as well ?? Just my opinion being a 28 yo woman and reading your statements -

• stop calling yourself unattractive. By saying this  have put yourself on a sort of lower scale & are probably treating others - especially people who YOU find good looking as better than you. 
Fact - they are not better

• socially awkward - have you ever analysed why you feel this way. Do you get anxiety when you enter a group of people, Or when you walk into a new place with unfamiliar faces?
Work on your confidence, watch some YouTube videos. Improve on your self worth & self esteem.
And stop caring what others think about you.
It doesn't matter, how you view yourself matters.

• coming back to your title -
So you haven't had a sexual experience. 
If you're constantly thinking about that, it'll make matters worse .
And if you really want some experience, go on tinder or start a friends with benefits with someone who is interested in you.
In the end even the experience won't help you get over the lonely feeling that one craves.

• people who are genuine & want real relationships can judge a person by their vibe.
If you're kind, genuine, helpful & a warm open person, you'll definately get really great women who would be interested in you.
But you have to build a personality for that, & not use excuses like I'm socially awkward, haven't had experience etc...
All that can be worked on. & I'm sure you have some role models or celebs. Watch how those people behave & carry themselves.
& Please stop going on your looks, or on anyone else's.


Hope this helps & sorry if I crossed any line Ye pubG wala hai kya? Lol I know I'll have the same faith. And guess what, I'll enjoy every moment of it. Marriage is overrated anyway. Amsterdam jao. somvar ke vart rakh bhai ladki jarur milegi pakka vada hai mera. Indian women are becoming independent as years go by and don't stay in marriages where the husband is an abuser or dowry problems, etc. So I think there are diorced women you can look out for or may be widows who lost their husband due to accident, etc.

Just go through matrimonial ads in news papers, you will surely find some one, don't give up, there is someone for you. Are you manglik? Women in India go for cash, not looks or personality.

But if you can't afford a new car, you can always go for second hand. Look in the ""caste no bar"" section of the matrimonials. They have all the divorcées and widows listed there. As a bonus, they'll be in your age range. And just to make you feel better, they usually have ""marriage not consummated"". Kind of like ""2 year old car, barely driven"". So even your parents won't mind. Bruv atleast you can bang a nice hooker just for the heck of it, nothing wrong if you keep the mortality aside. Posting on reddit or whatsapp wont solve the problem trust me. Just go and bang a bitch even if you have to pay, we will feel more relaxed and you wont be a Virgin after that I don't wish to karma-whore or hijack your Ama (though not really an ama if you do not reply, OP)

I'm in the same boat, kinda. I'm 21m, and haven't done those things either. My college is over, so I have no real way of meeting girls or anything now. Tinder really isn't my scene(not saying this to be one of those ""I don't think online dating is real"" people). Now I'm scared one day I'll be posting something like this too. It really is a hollow feeling man, I can almost physically feel the pain in my chest. Hope it gets better for you though, OP. 

Yes, I gym. No, I don't party coz most of my close friends are studying to be CAs, so I won't see them for the next 10 years. I work in my uncle's delivery firm, so no real work friends either. [deleted] [you should see this](https://twitter.com/Joydas/status/1101694386767912967) Have you visited /r/FA30plus or /r/ForeverAlone?
I'm Indian American and in your boat, except 31 years old. After how many rejections did you give up ? Just curios. Were you not comfortable comprising at all? I have seen street bums getting married.  What were the reasons for rejections?

 What line of work are you in? Do you feel like you are abnormal and something is not completely right with you? If yes, then how do you make peace with it? If no, then how do you avoid such feelings?  What kind of music do you like?  Why no hookers? Seriously. Has this affected your work life? Future me, how often and in what manner is this aspect of your life bright up by your friends and collegues?

An entirely new set of connections could alter the odds towards favourable. Have you considered marrying women from a poor background? What about someone is lower caste? If you are that desperate to marry, you should be okay with that. Most of them who are in the low economic class would be happy to marry someone who earns 1lpm. If feel if you don't don't have high expectations, it's not that hard to marry in India. Late here ... But I have a suggestion. If possible join a drama group or dance class even if you don't meet a girl there ... You may find the activity enjoyable. Were you at any point in your life not interested in marriages or relationships? I want to confirm, coz i am now at that point and not sure whether i regret about this in future. If you are not finding a partner, lower your standards.

Homeless, crippled, ugly as fuck  mofos find a wife. Why can't you?

 But are you willing to lower  your standards? Is it worth it? Now that, is another matter. Bro try some divorced women market. You will get easily one.no point in growing old alone  Sorry Late to the AMA...so here is my question...
You said you were tired of the rejection but how many eligible women did you reject?  You shouldn't feel bad. I seriously don't understand why marriages and relationships are hyped so much.. 

Please have intercourse to break the assumption.

Enjoy life to the fullest mate. Hey. Have you considered therapy and meditation? If you're not happy with yourself, you can't meet anyone. Confidence alone can get you places. 

How many of the rejections you have hat are because of your mind bringing up past rejections? It is your mind that is sabotaging a lot of the times, since you can't communicate with being frozen with fear and self conciousness. 

Find a good counsellor in your area (preferably Cognition Based Therapy). I know people whose lives have turned around because of that. Also, consider some form of meditation, or join Art of Living or some other meditation based support group.

Let me emphasize this. It is important to fix what you feel is wrong with yourself. You have to realise the value of this life and not give up on making it better. Pm if you wanna talk. 

Cheers :) ""I know how you feel"", because I'm just 4 years behind you. How does it feel to be not attractive? How does not being physically attractive affect the way you are treated in day to day life? What advice do you have for physically undesirable men? Dude there are many girls in there 30s who are also not getting married 

Apparently the corporates are giving holiday to go look for brides and grooms  hmm interesting.  almost mid 30's F here and single by choice. Unlike you I've had enough share of relationship and have ruthlessly dumbed quit a few for vivid reasons. One of them (as I go through your post) is self-pity. 
So my only one peace of advice would be to stop crying and self loathing, get your act together. 


I honestly have never come across any smiling face that's ugly. Rest sense of humor, confidence, positive aura, good physic  blah blah can always be worked upon only if you wish to put that extra effort on it. 


To end my point all I want to say is, no one likes to hear anyone's  *randi rona*. 

Good Luck. 


   What do you mean hug-less? Give yourself a hug ! Hug your parents :)  I would suggest you to get a hobby and a dog. Might help you to kill some time. 1) go to gym

2) Find way to get rich. *Scrolls down the entire thread*

I did an AMA here a while ago. You can [read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8w1kbb/hi_india_im_a_pakistani_ama/)

It was honestly one of the most moving experiences of my life. People started off slightly aggressive, with downvotes and sarcasm, but by the end we were all laughing about saalans in icecream dabbas, ""Sharma jee ka beta"" mentality, newspaper liners in drawers, and swapping music and movies.

I'm so sad about the tragedies going on at our borders right now. To me, an Indian life lost is as big a travesty as a Pakistani life lost, and I know my Pakistani friends feel the same.

Hamari zubaan ek hai, rang ek hai, libas ek hai, aur ham ek waqt par ek hee hotay thay. Just because you say dibba and I say dabba doesn't mean we can't get along.

I just wanted to ask my Indian dost how you guys feel about what's happening, and wondering if there's anything the people - you and I - can do to make things better?

**This is a time for dialogue and friendship and acceptance. Let's not let stupidity and fear and anger ruin what we've been trying to create.**

Please talk to me, and tell me your points of view.

Love you guys!

Dhanyawaad!",WhereIsLordBeric," It warms my heart to see your kind message.

People from both counties need to not respond to hate with hate. This doesn't mean that either side becomes a doormat. Definitely not. But I find it sad to see people take pride in the attack or retaliation. The loss of life is never something to take pride in or rejoice for.

I think it is important for us Indians to keep in mind that the terrible attack was by terrorists and extremists and not every Pakistani. That most of the people of Pakistan condemn the act. For this, it would help if Pakistanis could openly vocally condemn too. 

It will really help matters if there is interaction between our communities. A lot of the distrust is out of ignorance, out of just not knowing better. It is understandable given our histories and excusable if it hasn't done genuine harm. People have been fed incorrect data on the other nation and nothing but more awareness, more truth can fix this. 

Most importantly, I would like to mention is that I'm Indian and we say dabba at home. I did not go through the previous AMA so if it was acknowledged that some Indians do say dabba and dibba is just much more common then forgive me for bringing it up again. 

Edit: I realize I haven't asked a question here but I am looking to discuss ways to control the situation. Also I did want to ask about how it's portrayed by Pakistani news but someone already did.  Im scared. I have no clue how any of this is going to play out, I hope to god that this is just for the election and both sides will de escalate soon but I'm honestly worried I Might get drafted.maybe I'm paranoid, but we're talking about a possible nuclear war. What scares me most is how Indians seem to be reacting to the new if the strikes. I don't understand how people can be celebrating sending a missile into another country. Yeah sure it was terror camps, but we shouldn't celebrate that. We should do it with reluctance. War is the last refuge of the incompetent. It shouldn't be worshipped. I was talking to one of my friends last night and as she was going she said ""main sone chali neend mein thode Pakistani maarne hai"" 

I was shocked and offended so badly how someone so young ( I'm 19 she's 18 ) can have some much hatred. I get the anger that Pakistan **might** house terrorists and it's a matter of concern for both of the countries. Later on I ended up arguing and saying that people like her is why war comes into the picture.

But I see so many people with so much hatred towards innocent people who just have no hatred towards our country. It makes me feel sad. 

I'm grateful there people like you who try to resolve and talk things rationally instead of going berserk and spreading hate.

I've seen enough documentaries and talked to enough American war veterans to know how bad and traumatic war is. I'd never wish Something like this upon any of the countries.

I just hope all of this ends soon and no more lives are lost. 

Thank you for your efforts. Peace.  Elections are coming, they will end and so will all the chaos. day by day I am becoming a big fan of reddit in this time of tension its heartening to see a discussion happening rather than abusing each other. I am not in FB as its extremely toxic and in twitter also people are baying for each other’s blood. war is a lose lose situation for both the countries, hope pakistani army will follow the geneva convention and send our brave pilot safe and sound and peace will prevail again. Whatever this is, this is made to look as an immediate response to a heinous attack on Indian soil through terror camps based out of Pakistan. It is a show of power, and it is something that has deep political implications because the elections are coming. The only big news is that munitions were actually dropped in another country. Indian jets have crossed Pakistani airspace for a while now but it was for surveillance only.  

This show of force isn't going to do anything because in the end the ISI/Military will be do what they have always done, send terrorists in with their blessings. Your governments have always been a puppet of the ISI. The utter humiliation of 1971 is not something anyone in the military has forgotten, nor will they ever forget. And Kashmir is just a playground for the proxy war and that is about it. In the end, the citizens will suffer. Both sides of the border. And jingoism will continue. In the end let us all agree that mutton biriyani is the best, and veg biriyani should be nuked.  [removed] Politics, attacks etc. may happen, but there is no need to hate a common Pakistani citizen staying in Lahore or Karachi who is busy minding his own job. I know we have these issues. They need to be solved mutually. Till then, you guys keep on producing music. We are producing our movies. Out of our hands really. Morons outnumber on both sides.  Welcome bhai.

Our leaders need sense.  There's absolutely no need for people to die.  Not Indian, not Pakistani.  At the end of the day we're all in this big messy world together.  This is so unnecessary.

Yes, love you guys too..
An Indian. Hi, can you help me understand why some Pakistanis are upset due to indian army shooting down terrorist camp. 

No civilian was harmed & no armyman was killed, so why the hate ?

and I have to say this, India & Pakistan is temporary, Chicken Biryani is forever. >Let's not let stupidity and fear and anger ruin what we've been trying to create.

It's because Elections are coming. This was the easiest and predicted way to cover up failure in governance. Hence this is the last refuge of any scoundrel who is in power. Hitler did it, Stalin did it, Gaddaffi and Saddam both did it to earn people's misguided belief. 

This can never happen in First world countries, knowing fully well people are smarter than a 5th grader which both our countries lack and the bullshit will be called off regarding what caused it. Both our governments are friends in the background and know each other's tastebuds, but like any actor's job they have to act like enemies for profit.

In the UN, both our countries ranks horribly in terms of basic human issues and aspects. That's why this is what the government has to offer to us. Sell Patriotism and to create that a bloody game of Hate and Carnage. 

The lucky ones are those from both our countries are those people who quit and settled down in first world countries for better lives and they get to fuel hatred by means of spending money and few comments. Meanwhile they share drinks and bang chicks and laugh in those first world countries tell both of us how stupid we are to fall for this.

Us Indians always puts a poor man down under the Sewage to clean and remove poop and toxics without protection. And we talk about injustice and revenge? Please. Why does your army have a chokehold over the civilian government? Since last time we met Gloria Jeans's outlet came up dude. Do you live in a major city? Have you tried imagining what a mushroom cloud will look like? I live in Karachi and was thinking of what it would look like and if I would see it in the distance before it hits me. I don't want war. I don't want people to die. But it seems inevitable now. The nut cases have taken over the government and they will take us to war for their greed and pride. Maybe increased  tourism can help bring down the ignorance. This next  one is never going to happen thanks to terrorism  but linent Visa and property , land owning laws between the countries . This will decrease the partition hate because both countries feel something was taken away from them forever .



My 2 chwanis on why we hate each other

Pakistan: Army controls everything even elected govt . To maintain / justify this control they need masses in fear of attack from a  strong and evil enemy. 

India : when ever we have a major festival or celebration or any happy time there's always an terrorist attack .sometimes it's busted sometimes they are successful ,they chant Allah hu akhbar while killing civilians and the organization which claims the attack is always based/operating from inside Pakistan . Point blank - can Pak, military establishment/ISI or govt, live without Kashmir? If not then there's nothing to discuss, Pak's one point agenda has always been ""the piece of land"" - if they weren't so dishonest about it the bloodshed of last 7 decades could've been avoided. India will not & cannot give up on Kashmir, so that's the bottom line.

Lastly good morning (evening?) to you, in whichever part of the world you are atm. I think you should educate all your fellow citizens to not support terrorism and vote for a government that  doesnt support terrorism.  

I know many of you all are peace loving people,  but you people should also take a stand against your government [removed]",AMA,2019-02-27 13:06:43

Just curious, why did you get married so late (by Indian standards)? Were you apprehensive initially? If so, why? And how is your everyday life different now?

PS: I'm hitting 32 this year and I have very little interest in getting married.  When you were a kid, were you open to arranged marriages?

If no, when did your perspective change? If no, do you feel like you compromised your ideals in order to find someone?

If yes, were you scared about letting the other person down due to un-communicated expectations either of you might have from the other? If yes, are you scared of ever finding or running into someone now whom you might consider ""your perfect match"", but now ofcourse you cant do anything since you're in an arranged marriage Blink twice if you're being made to do this against your will  Malayali? chaliye naye couple ko vannakum.!

Note this is just an announcement, the actual AMA will be posted at the earlier date and time. Please direct your questions to that thread.",doc_two_thirty," how do you guys get access to him? whom did you approach? what did you guys thinking when you started making this documentary? mod ask this question for me ii might just forget I was following it since it was first called ' preposition for a revolution' , but it was never going to be released in J&K. So a warm thanks for putting it for free on YouTube.  It was a great film, but you could tell their access stopped once kejriwal became CM. However, as a viewer, that's the point I really wanted to get an inside look into AAP - it was after coming to power that they lost a few of their morals, and started kicking out smart people like Yogendra.

Everything they covered till that point is sort of, in the public domain. We already knew that stuff - the film just gave a more human look at things. I hope they aren't selective in choosing which questions to answer What's your perception on Kejriwal base on your 1-1 interaction with him during the shoot? How different he really is than what is portrayed by the media? AAP died once Yogendra left. Thanks Mods for arranging this, I can't thank you guys enough for this!

/u/doc_two_thiry can you please include this in your post?

Full movie, everyone should watch this-

And their interview with VICE - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc22xwvaXV8 You have made the film out of 400 hours recording. Can we expect that you will release some more short videos  [deleted] This is a good & a promising one. Will get to know a lot of inside details.  Nice! I'm interested to know how they managed to cover the whole thing from up-close and facing Indian Govt censoring and other shit.  Great..hope the AMA gets conducted on Friday/Saturday. Why the frequency of making movies by your team is really slow? How are you still alive?

Or are you out of the country already?

[NP] Armab Goswami AMA discussion thread,265,67uw22,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67uw22/np_armab_goswami_ama_discussion_thread/,331,"IMO, it's a disappointment. ",Thisisbhusha," > it's a disappointment

Understatement . He did not answer a single question properly.  I wasn't surprised how it went. People who are so used to scripted interviews can barely make good of AMAs. I am not a big tv watcher. So far I thought Arnab is that guy who just shouts on TV but atleast he seems to be a guy with strong moral values and guts to speak his mind.

Reading that AMA I felt the complete opposite. He came across like that soft spoken neighbour hood aunty that won't stop nagging  you until you eat her ""worlds best sambhar"". Also how she avoids every other question yet somehow manage to mention about her sambar in every line.  Has anyone compiled a list of the 'pearls of wisdom' given to us by Arnab?

Like:

['Freedom for a reporter is in his mind.'](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67us0c/this_is_arnab_goswami_i_am_here_as_promised_ask/dgte6gk/)

['There can never be enough nationalism. More the better.'](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67us0c/this_is_arnab_goswami_i_am_here_as_promised_ask/dgtdmwg/)

['All Indians should be pro military and pro India. If that makes us right wing, then so be it.'](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67us0c/this_is_arnab_goswami_i_am_here_as_promised_ask/dgtdkim/)

Edit: ['There is no political positioning. There is right and wrong. Im for the right. Those who win in grey waters are confused or dishonest.'](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67us0c/this_is_arnab_goswami_i_am_here_as_promised_ask/dgtdpau/) Well He is a performance artist for me now on. My takeaway: It is easy to ask tough questions to people and very difficult to answer them.

That's clear from the answers of a person who made a career out of asking tough questions. /u/thatscoopquestion

4 hour old account, posted (at the time of writing) 3 soft, simple questions, Arnab answered them all in succession. Am I being paranoid? Seemed like he hired someone off internshala to do the AMA on his behalf and just gave them the direction ""REPUBLIC IS THE BEST AND UNBIASED. K? BYE.""
 A man who claims to do hard hitting journalism cant handle straight questions . I don't think he is quite sharp . He said to an answer that everyone shall be pro-military - that something you expect from an 19 year old who hasn't read much history or politics .

I like army as an institution but am i pro-military nopes that looks like a path to blindness to me    Cringefest Just like Newshour was. It was an enormous disappointment. This AMA was billed as a big ticket event. Ended up being a damp squib. Sudarshan News ceo ka bhi Ama karwa do lage haath. Coming soon on Republic TV: 🔥 Brave Arnab goes and talks directly to the anti-nationals at r/india. Republic Exclusive! 🔥

The AMA was pathetic. Pretty much validates everything I though about him. I guess somewhere Wire.in guys would be jerking off to this AMA. It was a total mess. Its a fucking disgrace. Also, the mods should differentiate between and AMA and an AMAA. Publicity AMAs should be treated as advertisements. I think Arnab hates intellectuals because he probably wouldn't have a leg to stand on if he ever got scrutinized. Also, did he passive aggressively threaten the former fan with the long question?


""See you soon"" he said Well Shit! The replies read less like an Oxford-educated, supposed hard-hitting journalist  
and more like a right-wing BJP shill who's here to peddle his wares... I feel cheated.  ALmost every question had the answer as a variation of this line: ""We will launch REPUBLIC soon, cant wait to be back on tv"". He is the probably the most unethical mainstream journalist we have and he is going to get unrestricted editorial range in the new channel.  

He has his own definition of free of speech. Still spouting lies about the JNU students. Dimesses foreign press and activists. Is ok with using human shields and a host of other morally indefensible beliefs.   

No matter how much this AMA will look like we've flanked him, no amount of ad-hominem he got is enough. Once he gets cameras pointed at him, the kangaroo courts he will telecast live will do more damage to our sanity than r/india can ever do. We'll be left in disbelief at a number of insane things he'll spout and only be cleaning up after. 

Fuck that guy. 

 [deleted] https://m.imgur.com/GR1bRMU
What is according to you the best  moment from AMA?? At least he answered mine.But none of them were to the point, missing the point by a wide swath. I guess it was a deliberate tactic to move away from anything that might affect his pro bjp leanings .  It's a complete trainwreck. I hope he lost a few viewers today, and that would be quite fitting, if he carries on with his channel with the same attitude. If he changes, I'm all ears. I hope theWire.in or others write about this poor AMA. That will trigger Arnab Priyanka Chopra AMA > Arnab Goswami AMA Worse than I expected, he didn't even put on a facade of trying to have a sincere discussion. 


Just publicized his channel and gave some flippant  responses to detailed questions.  Clearly the esteemed journalist was here to promote the new republic channel .Got roasted on Reddit but I am afraid most of the people will fall for the prey outside reddit. Even I thought his channel will be better. Now I won't watch any shit from it.  Poora timewaste tha like his newshour -_- [I said that first](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67h0uz/announcement_ama_with_arnab_goswami_on_27th_april/dgqf5sb/)

I knew this good for nothing sneaky bastard will do as predicted. The way the AMA looks right now, it is quite weird. The critical questions, which have the highest number of upvotes, are nowhere close to the top. 

The questions at the top are softballs. I guess that ranking is getting manipulated by the PR team as well.  R/india never forgets . Arnab shouldn't have done the AMA , he will now become the ""door knob"" of r/india :) Advertisement kar gya bahen chod. He can't shut mic here.  Holy shit...I felt sorry for this shit when I learned he was abruptly fired, but now after the AMA I wish Times had decimated him... Appalled by the below reply from a Journalist of his stature. I want it to be debated. 

> I feel the army and paramilitary needs to be given greater powers in Kashmir

My view: 
Appalled that it comes from a journalist. So should there be a systemic eradication of seperatists or whom the Army and the state think to be a threat? There was only 7% turn-out in the recently concluded by-elections in J&K. Let's say these 7% are true nationalists, On this basis I would go ahead and assume(based on past turn-outs) 20% would like to vote and would therefore want to be associated with India but because of fear they did not. This still keeps out 73%, Who you Sir want to be killed, raped and be subjected to severe torcher because the state and the army ""thinks"" to be a threat to the sovernieghty of the country. Clearly you have a bias even if you do not want to proclaim it out in the open. PSA to make it easier to read sort by q&a He was drunk I think. There was no difference between vocab of Donald Trump and his'. I asked how will you expand republic's coverage to global level, he answered ""we will use digital + technology"".

His other answers also were like they were being typed by trump. Lacked any depth whatsoever. These statements he made here in written maybe didn't look as good as they would've on TV coming out of his mouth filled with anger. Anyway this article in caravan mag correctly described he hates facts. He runs his media empire all on emotions. All his statements like ""everyone needs to be pro india"" ""no amount of nationalism is enough in a person"" were an attempt to speak to our patriotic emotions. But he wasn't aware, it worked on times now for years but reddit isn't as gullible as an average Times Now viewers.

In his mind during AMA he must be like ""i'm nailing this AMA as I'm speaking in favour of our kulcha and kountry and army"" just as Rahul Gandhi was feeling during his interview with arnab ""I'm nailing it as i'm speaking about women empowerment, RTI and candidate selection"". He got the taste of his own medicine today.

I can't believe people thought he was so rad and a ""fearless journalist"". He din't show a single quality of a journalist today. Our reddit trolls are better than him on an average. I'm happy about this AMA, he must be feeling where he stands now. I don't know if Arnab ever looked at the r/india community before agreeing to the AMA. From the questions to his responses I always knew it would probably end up like this. Celebrities come here expecting to simply have a chat with fans and face hard-hitting questions they would never expect to answer in a public forum.

Ultimately as an AMA... It wasn't much. I doubt it will have a net effect in his channel's visibility considering how niche this subreddit really is.

BTW, how did we score someone like Arnab for an AMA in the first place, /u/_dexter? Did you guys reach out to him and convince him or did he contact you? he is a  desperate for any publicity  Is it over?  ye sab moh maya hai Was that even him? Did he post any picture as a proof before the AMA? My thoughts on this AMA : 'Rampart' So. Much. Bhakti.  Arnab, we know you are lurking here and reading these comments, 

Your AMA is how should you roast your guest in lower case letters, you don't need to raise your volume for it. For a while i thought it was a Roast rather than an AMA When there will be riots in India, Arnab - the asshole that he is, will demand answers from NGO's who are helping in the relief process.

From reading his answers, it is clear that man will support genocide, dictatorship and slavery - come what may, in the guise of pseudo-nationalism. Fucking cunt. I guessed it would be bad but not this bad. 

He avoided tough questions, barely answered in more that a couple of lines, and he actually said 'We need more nationalism'  Can we have NaMo for an AMA soon given his love for attention ? This time he like one of the politicians in his show and randia is like Arnub himself.
No right questions answered but kinda completed AMA INDIA WANTS TO KNOW
 IMO, It was tatti. Ghanghor tatti.  I called it **R/India's Rampart** 

**#Arnabdodges** This AMA shows that people have no honest motivation and be truthful and discuss ideas, both which go with them or against them. People think they are celebrity and should be put on a pedestal. This in my opinion is what holds our country back! Not enough honest discussion, obviously except on r/india Freedom for a reporter is in his mind !
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcdHul2F8Rs

I don't think he was here to answer any questions , he was just looking for some cheap PR for his channel but was bamboozled by r/india NATIONAL TREASURE^^TM I think his actual persona and media persona are two different things. But he knows what to sell as what matters these days is the bottomline I am reminded about this book now :http://www.sup.org/img/covers/med_large/pid_23082.jpg

The main point is your nation's IQ is more important than yours and people like Arnab are using it that to the fullest  Looking at his answers, he's the polar opposite of what he appears to be on TV (I'm assuming that none of his team members had a role in the AMA).

Most of his views were downright atrocious.

'Freedom for a reporter is in his mind.'

'There can never be enough nationalism. More the better.'

'All Indians should be pro military and pro India. If that makes us right wing, then so be it.'

Yeah, bitch.
 What did we expect? Reasonable discussion or answers from a BJP guy?  Guys you are taking this too seriously.

for him reddit is just another site to advertise. he does not take ama/reddit as seriously as other people take or people here take. probably the same way you dont care much what people say on FB/twitter

 Remember this is a publicity AMA for his new channel launch more than an actual AMA. Having said that, he is quite unabashed about his ideology and not really taking the bait... most of the really good questions are asked in his replies and he is not looking at them.

Even his answers to the controversial or hard hitting question are one line answers.... ""I love India"" kind of answers, you can't really argue with that.

But he is standing his ground, you got to give him that. What the fuck ? The answers didn't even read like it was Arnab. Is his TV personality that different ? Fuking retarded AMA if someone else did it for him. I wonder if he is going to have a discussion about this AMA on Republic  Somehow he chose his questions. I don't think AMA from arnab should be like that. It's called Ask me Anything for a reason  [The Arnab Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mswb4eT-kXg0) Arnab Giswami destroyed the meaning of unbiased journalism today. I was very excited for this AMA but it was a disappointment. This AMA was r/amadisasters material.  Shitty AMA. Glad I missed it.  Was it Arnab? Did the mod verify him? Sounded like a troll. So many mods and no proof pics? Mods get your shit together Hmmmm GODDAMNIT.

Whats the point of being subscribed to this timesink for 2 years if I miss an ARNAB ama?

I feel like such an antinashnul :/ Arnab Goswami is the Indian Alex Jones. Seriously. I wish someone had asked him why he was so soft with Modi. How does it feel to be dedicated liblords outraged about being dominated by autists, amateurs and low iq right wingers first in politics, then on media and now right here on your professional shitposting turf? You guys are so pathetic The problem is with those who expected anything more than PR bluff from him.

To me, he is no more than an ignorant BJP ass licker.

Atleast Congress has/had some smart Pro-Congress journalists  I was looking forward to a concise but meaningful AMA. I mean the guy is on TV for a long time and well informed than most of us. :-/ Anti nationals will be nationalized once republic TV airs 

Edit:  /s  There was no verification post so how can people even believe that it was him? [deleted] But it's what randia deserves. People saying he is dumb etc. on this AMA he can always proxy someone else or do google and answer. on TV he has to be interactive.",AMA,2017-04-27 19:05:32

"Hi, I’m Swati - CoFounder of CashKaro.com - Ask Me Anything about Entrepreneurship, Cashback model/industry & more!",103,6rk5x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6rk5x5/hi_im_swati_cofounder_of_cashkarocom_ask_me/,214,Verification: http://imgur.com/Hw8aplH,Swati_CK," This idea of coupons is still a thing people stay away from (atleast from third party sites), don't know about your site or how it works but according to the AMA announcement thread, people actually think this as a very non legit (even though it may be),
how do you make people aware of the business model and its legitness?

Also, the idea of all of this is okay, but its still gonna be very limited even at its peak, not sure but many entrepreneurs just grab the invested money, make bucks and leave since many if not all start ups don't have a money making model that can be incorporated, comments on this??


lastly how do you make money? if tomorrow all of the retailers you take coupons from start handling out their own cash backs and make up a system similar to yours wouldn't it take your firm out on this? Hey Swati, loving the attitude, you did walk in to an AMA which could've been all guns on you, you did excellent.

As a two time startup guy who managed to get acquired (fairly happy) both the times - touchwood-, I'd like to know where do you see CK going? A possible exit by acquisition? 

Additionally, what drives bigger business motifs for you - niche ecommerce or mass multi vendor? 

I was also consulting one of the biggest coupons startups a few years back, and thought they would be far bigger now - but they couldn't innovate at the rate at which they should have (still one of the biggest..hint hint..elephant :P ), lack of innovation and burning to build a quasi loyalty program does end up draining most of the money out of the system for some players in the similar space. 

r/India doing me a prod as well by maintaining decorum.  This feels like a good AMA by reading all the answers. So how's your normal day like Swati?  Yes, I have read them. Both Amazon and Flipkart are well aware of our business model.. we work with their teams directly and in fact they tell us about all their upcoming promotions in advance, even buy extra advertisement space. They don't like us giving Cashback as real cash hence, you will see on CashKaro that we offer CashKaro Rewards for Amazon and Flipkart shooping - these can be withdrawn as Amazon/Flipkart Gift Vouchers rather than NEFT transfer. So there is no issue really.. they may not work with every Cashback site but they do work with us in a legitimate manner. 

https://cashkaro.com/stores/flipkart
https://cashkaro.com/stores/amazon (in fact Amazon informs us every month which categories are allowed for Cashback - these change every month)  
Total staff strength? Why should someone use CashKaro and not other Cashback websites? (Other websites have better UI and similar offers IMO) On a scale of KRK to SRK this is Tiger Shroff 😂 Do you sell customer data? Isn't cashback industry too dependent on online retailers? What if tomorrow Flipkart and Amazon starts to provide cashback directly to consumers like Paytm? Do you think they don't already do so because it is not a profitable business practice? In the AMA announcement there was a comment which suggested that CashKaro had not followed through on the rebate for the person. How often does this happen? Do you track this as the CEO? What are you doing to prevent it?

Looking at your Facebook page, the top 2-3 reviews are from former interns or current employees. Are you comfortable with what that insinuates about your business? Hi swati , thanks for doing AMA

Do you think little app is your competitor? Its catching up these days in restaurant , saloon deals. This turned out better than I thought. How do you compete against credit cards giving cashback? I just purchased a phone on Amazon and HDFC bank gave me 2k as cash back [deleted] Little late to the party. But here's my grievance. I signed up in 2015, shopped for over 70k through Cashkaro, never got a single penny. Filed a complaint, no reply, reminder sent, no reply. Fuck Cashkaro. I now ask people to not use this website CashCrow. Game of Coupons. Bunch of Out of Control Crow Coupons luring White Walkers (customers).  Nice handwriting [removed] What are your thoughts on r/India community ? Or is this the first time you're using Reddit? why are u doing this AMA?  You don't seem to have an android app. Can we infer from this that most of your target customers purchase using a laptop and not via smartphones?

On a similar note, what did you think of flipkart's app-only trial. As a member of senior management of a tech company, would you tell me the importance of grades while hiring freshers and experienced people? [deleted] Glad I read this. Maybe will try it out. All credit to you for doing a AMA. Hoping more founders will follow suite. Hi Swati. Your website design can be a lot more better. And what's the deal with ad on the left? All the best.  Wow you're still answering the questions. You're great Swati. :) Where do you get the coupons from? On a scale of Arnab Goswami to Shashi Tharoor, I'll rate this AMA as Arvind Kejriwal. Why do cashbacks get denied almost half the time? [deleted] Looks like the party is over. But, in case if u r reading, I would like to know whether CashKaro has any plan to integrate bitcoin in the system? An example application is https://purse.io, but they dont work for Indian eCommerce sites. So, probably an untapped market for Indian CashBack site like CashKaro, especially when we are witnessing minister's interest in Bitcoin - https://twitter.com/PriyankKharge/status/888955190505750528 Your suggestions for a 21 year old? Liked the AMA. Good job, Swati. All the best.

Edit: I do have a few questions.

1. Could you tell us about your experience at Goldman Sachs?  

2. What competitive advantage does Gurgaon provide? (In comparison with, let's say, Bengaluru).

3. What's your favourite book?   Have you ever thought about introducing a chrome extension which reminds people to purchase it through cashkaro whenever they are going to buy something from Amazon or others? How did you get Ratan Tata to invest in Cashkaro? What are his views on the future of the firm? How did you get Kalari capital to invest in cashkaro? How long do you think a site like CashKaro.com would survive? Do you think this is profitable? If yes, what gives CashKaro.com a competitive advantage i.e. how long would it take someone else to build a similar product like CashKaro.com? I myself want to be an Entrepreneur, what are the steps to get there? Any shortcuts?
 What is your advice for young students?  Pouring Pounds is similar to CashKaro?  Hi, could you tell us about how you started the firm? The setbacks and how you sustain it, Thank you. What's the plan with Mr. Tata on board.. new fundings or you gonna get him to do an ad for you..?

No on a serious note what's the direction of the company now that ecommerce is consolidating?  What do you want to say to your customers about the future of Cashkaro? you still here? what's your company turnover? I can see why a *""6.78%, 20.3% 'cashback', rewards, payment""* etc can get complicated  for average Indian customers, afterall the market is dominated by CoD orders. For this business to go mainstream, things need to get simplified. 

As you said most of the visits are from desktop users says what big chunk of customers you're missing out on, considering top e-commerces get most visitors from mobile platform. An app should be the next big thing.

 *Suggestions.* When customers search for a product on your site instead of say on Amazon, Amazon would miss out on all the customer search data (which I think is very valuable - to Amazon) , how are you thinking of sharing search data about customers with retailers? Or will you try to monetize that data? ;) Any plans of offering coupons for cryptocurrency?  I am a big proponent of the affiliate cashback system and have several questions. Hope you find the time to answer them! Welcome to Reddit btw.

**1**: Who would you say is your fiercest competitor right now? 

I've been a longtime user of GoPaisa although TopCashBack seems to be giving the highest rates in the industry right now.

**2**: Do you feel the need to differentiate in a saturated market?

I would definitely consider CashKaro if it was THE place on the internet for comprehensive and meticulously maintained coupon code page, apart from cashback. I think Grabon has the lead in that segment.

**3**: Why is there no cashback for eBay?

**4**: Is the 250 bucks minimum payout ideal if you want to drive adoption and retention? GP and TCB have 150 and 0 Rs minimum.
 Hi Swati! Hope I haven't missed you. Thanks for doing the AMA. The announcement post got very critical and your AMA has cleared many misconceptions. I have never used any cashback sites before but will definitely have a look at CashKaro from now on.   

My question to you is - Do you think people who have great academic background (Top MBAs and decent work ex) are less prone to failures compared to people jumping into startups right after colleges? Also do you have any advice for new age entrepreneurs who feel almost every market/niche is tapped and that new ideas/products are a great disadvantage given the competition.   What tech stack is used for CashKaro.com? Hi; How this model is different from Affiliated Marketing ?? Hey Swati, I don't have any questions but just want to thank you on a patient and positive AMA. Good luck with Cashkaro. what advice would you give to an undergrad who wants to do something in agriculture sector Probably a stupid question. But, by any chance, would FK / Amazon etc. charge more if we come through your website? As opposed to the normal route of buying through them only instead? Don't you think that your business model has a very limited growth opportunity and lifespan?

Your model is based on generating affiliate income from e-tailers like flipkart, etc. and offering a cash-back as incentive to the people whom you refer. As you start to grow, don't you think that some of these retailers will think of bypassing you and start giving these offers directly to customers?

There is also the question of profitability. In a competition market, traders hardly earn a 10% margin on FMCG, how much can they afford to give as affiliate commission? On top of that, if you start giving cash-backs, there will hardly be anything left to keep for yourself? We are talking about 10% of 10% of 10%, really! I often get bored at my workplace when given same type of work. If someone of your employee feel bored at workplace and come tell you, what would you say or do? 
I am a fresh graduate.  Wow, great job Swati!

Kudos for being so chill! I want to establish an online shop as an online entrepreneur.To establish this what are the common steps I need to follow to set up my business primarily? Any suggestion or tips?
Thanks One interesting question. What's the way to get into London School of Economics. 
What are their expectations. And how much of economics background does someone need before applying? 

TYIA  As a kid I wanted to study Economics, but got pushed into studying science by parents. I leave for the US to study for Master's in Electrical Engineering after 10 days.

What should I do if I want to study Economics by I am thirty? I am 22, and I think I am good at Math. WoW. Great AMA. Dint hear about CashKaro before. Learnt about it today. Amazing concept.

/u/Swati_Ck If u r still reading this thread, I'd like to know if u'll be interested to place ad on an India focused mock test portal, i.e. education domain? Heard that you got to study abroad via scholarships.. How can one become eligible for that? Also any advises for youngsters in general?

Republic on Twitter: Block your calendar: Arnab Goswami LIVE on @redditindia AMA on 27th April – 4 PM. #AMAwithArnab,369,67gxrj,https://twitter.com/republic/status/856879360074145792,163,,shadowbannedguy1," I wish reddit had a box that said ""typing"" When you're typing a comment. That way Arnab could interrupt before you're done here too!  Let's all do this AMA in CAPS! ok? This is the baap of all AMAs! 

R/India is a pretty tough crowd too for Arnab given how much he was criticized for letting people down in the Modi interview. Let's see if he comes up with justifications for all that. This is gonna be fun. The man who proved that a news debate can be conducted with 32 panelists with 8 of them talking simultaneously out of the grid of 16 who are shown on screen at the same time which also includes 4 empty chairs. One of the fallouts of this move is a lot more  Indians discovering reddit. 

I was in love with Quora before the great Indian horde took over and destroyed the site. Sigh. 

Shit posters, trolls and 17 year old life advisors - reddit is not a good place, please stay away. 

 [deleted] r/India wants to know. Damn khoo. Kickass this will be.  Will Arnab answer #whatthenationwantstoknow?  Scenes when Arnab tells randia to shut down.  So finally all of India, WILL KNOW Fastway Cable is already showing Repubic Channel and a long interview ad of Gau-Swami is airing. I don't know why comments criticizing him are getting downvoted.
His first response to Sukma attack was ""Kanhaiya Kumar & Azaadi Brigade"".
When did questioning an Idiot Student leader become a brave thing?
Who the fuck is Kanhaiya Kumar and Why isn't he getting arrested if everyone believes that he is a terrorist sympathizer?
 Iski to mil kar lenge Nice. Next we should get Subramanian Swamy here. Will this be another disappointment like the previous much awaited Shashi Tharoor AMA ? more like block @redditindia Remind me 43 hours  This is gonna be juicy.  I doubt if he's already there in r/india.  Can we have a list of compulsary questions for him to answer before he can go on to answer softball promotional questions about his new venture? Why is he looking like Ravi Kishen? Will he be alone or will he come bundled along with Mahroof Raza ?  How will he shout here ? Type in ALLCAPS ?  Type in **bold** ? Or **BOTH** ?    aao bahen ke lund.  Does the nation want to know? #NATION WANTS TO KNOW, ARE YOU GOING TO BE TRULY IMPARTIAL IN YOUR JOURNALISM, OR GIVE WAY TO THE LATEST ARKNOB ON THE BLOCK, NEWS18'S FEROCIOUS ZAKKA JACOB Randia wants to know!  Will Arnab interrupt us or we will interrupt Arnab. Oh wow. What a catch! I think this AMA is going to be one for the ages. This here is shit and that is the fan... you know what to do. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9R4aGiXsAATLaI.jpg:large There is nothing special or innovative about launching an Indian version of Brietbart especially at a time when the party/ideology you support is decimating everything else. At least Brietbart did it when it was uncool Fuck yeah!!! Arnub is going to regret this  Really, Excited to hear about the Republic.. :) So what questions are off the table? Here it goes, he's gonna dodge all tough and high stake questions. You are welcome At least India finally has a news outlet that isn't obsessed with the INC. People on Twitter are asking for AMA videos to be uploaded on YouTube . Reddit is so popular! i want to ask when did he sell the soul to the bjp? This might as well be one of the most important AMAs in history of /r/India.

अब मज़ा आएगा... Remindme! 18 hours bring your phone to tuition No please. It will lead to arrival of innumerable number of *bhakts* on reddit.  I don't know about others but i for one am sure that i don't want reddit ama with arnab. After him other scumbags and journalist will start getting a an ama slot here and then more rigid moderation won't be far away. Remindme! 1 day  I genuinely don't know who he actually is, I vaguely remember him from a comedy sketch ""India wants to know"". Would appreciate some ELI5. So is he gonna reply in all caps? ab aayega maza . Hope he doesn't be all politically correct and answer nicely. The guy who defined my view of Rahul Gandhi without pandering to  the powerful Aaja Arnab the BJP sellout :)  It would have been nice if he did an AMA when he was not aligned with any political ideology and used to ask really tough questions to all parties on behalf of Dineshan. I want to know how often he sucks the Government's dick  Careful randia. Do not criticise the Army during the AMA. You have been warned. oh geez, more terrorist sympathizers will swarm this sub and participate in brigading. ",AMA,2017-04-25 22:37:37

[NP] [AMA]",186,9wyjtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9wyjtx/its_been_a_year_and_quarter_since_i_became_an/,310,"Hey guys, 23 year old living currently in Mumbai, I've been a gigolo, a male stripper (kinda) and a boytoy for the society women of Mumbai. I don't know how I can verify, but go ahead, Ask me Anything!

In addition: I am an Economic Grad and work as an independent consultant for a few NGOs and Think tanks, off which I did not earn a lot, leading to my present moonlighting job. Jokes apart, I'll try to answer any queries as seriously as possible. Thanks!

Edit 1: I need help with the verification, can someone point me out how I do it? Or how I can contact the mods to do the same?

Edit 2: After contact with the mods, they have said that there is no manner this post can be verified. Well, very well. I will close the AMA tomorrow noon, please ask anything you'd like, I don't mind answering it as long as it is not very personal. I did offer to show the mods my nudes to verify though 😁

Edit 3:

#End of AMA!

You guys have been amazingly fun to converse with, and I thoroughly enjoyed this. I'll be an active participant in r/India and I hope to participate in the daily discussions too! Thank you, y'all!",IndianDaddy," How do u perform if u are not attracted to a particular client ?  Is it usually cover the face and fire the base ? How pp so big saar? Is it expected that a gigolo has model-like looks and sculpted physique? Are you getting business because of your looks/body? From which area most of your clients are? 

What exactly are these hen parties?

Do you pay taxes? 

What are the chances for not so good looking guy? 

I have heard gym trainers can get into this line easily. Is it true?

Do most people in Mumbai provide or take escort services?

Are you Indian?

Is this post part of your promotion strategy? Ye to asli Rocco hai.. wo eco grad tha from lse, iirc Hi. I have few questions. Few may arise later too. Thanks for the AMA. 

1. Have you ever considered going for gay parties? Even if the pay was high.

2. What are government rules that one gigolo should be aware of one's safety if any situation arises with the police? And any personal rules too would work.

3. Any experience of Orgies?

4. You said that ""...nobody lies as much as porn"". What do you think can the porn do to better the viewer experience more realistic?

5. Do you get worried about STD's? Also, how many times 
a month do you go to Doctor?  I wasn't even aware this was a scene in India.

1. How did you become a professional gigolo? 
2. How do women hire you?
3. Is it fun at the parties as they show in porn? Or is there too much pressure? u/wannabeGigolo *Humko kehte Superman.... On Kar lo handycam...* Did you ever get caught? Does this effect your relationship? Do you mark out quick exit points, in case the husband/boyfriend arrives?  All i want to say is ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) *Nice* How much do you charge for 1 bob? 1. What exactly do you mean *boytoy*? What are those stripper parties like?

2. Have you even been physically / mentally abused? Do you any form of protection from the same? (Like being part of some group or something) How often do you suggest ideas/improvise etc about a session and how often do you partake in predefined activities only as suggested by clients?

Any role playing idea you’d love to pitch in a clients head that you’re excited about? 

Do all your clients establish consent before they randomly try something new with you or do you have some set boundaries or are you mostly flexible in your realm? What are some of the prejudices you encounter ? And how could I evade such prejudices, when talking to a friend who's in a similar line of work? How's your mental health?

Has your perception of women changed since you heh, entered the field?

If you were to give a few pointers towards sex-ed for the younger folks (not explicit stuff rather as in consent and boundaries etc) what would you have to say? 
1. Is it circumcised? What do women prefer?
2. Is it naturally 8.5 are did you use anything to increase the length?
3. What things in diet should one avoid to have a great stamina during sex? Have you been emotionally involved with them? 
Have you ever been blackmailed by them ?
 1. Do you have a girlfriend? If you do, does she know about your this line of work?

2. Do you intend to stop after some time? Let's say, like a financial goal or a relationship goal?

3. How did you meet the first lady who helped you out with the rest of the clients?

4. Have you met any of them outside of the sex in public? What was it like? Have any clients ever made non-sexual demands? Like cuddling, talking, friendship etc? How have you dealt with it? Noice. 

Reference milega kya bro? How can I pass my engineering exams ? Have you denied clients? Why? 

Do you own costumes / any special items? Jesus dude. Econ grad who does work for think tanks doing this on the side? 

Have you considered applying for scholarships/PhD overseas? That might actually help you get out of here and do something more meaningful. You seem like a bright chap and if you found yourself doing this, you sure are helluva creative problem-solver. I'm sure you can figure something out instead of doing this, as much fun as it might be, isn’t the best use of your education/potential. 

PS - Not judging/hating. If you enjoy it and that's what you want to do, for sure keep doing it. All your answers seem too generic to be believable unless you can verify. Don't have a question, just want to to tell you to stay safe. How do u keep a room full of strangers engaged? Do u get to the act straight away or?  What all activities do you involve in? Can you elaborate on that? According to you what causes immense pleasure for a woman? Is it penetrative sex? Favourite experience?

How much anal?

 [deleted] You say you charge 4k to 7k. Why haven't you charged more? I'm amused cos upper middle classish people spend more that on a night out drinking and you're offering them an experience. If you're gonna go out and do something risky why not up the charge? Say 15k? Have you given this a thought? What am I missing here? 5 to 7k seems low AF. Mind you, I'm completely unaware of the money dynamic in this scenario. Also do you optimise clients/sessions for money per hour made or fun per hour had? 

Thanks and Good luck. * You sound really smart and eloquent. If you don't mind me asking, how was your life so far in socioeconomic terms? You've mentioned that you work hard on your physical appeal, but how much of your attractiveness do you think comes from your mind? 

* Would someone who is maybe as attractive physically but not so impressive mentally still be as popular? how much infedility you noticed in this line of work? i mean does every other rich women/girls use sevices like this? You’re pretty fair skinned right ? I have been quite curious and obsessed with this stock Nasdaq:ROKU . Even after great quarterly numbers and higher expectations next quarter, the stock took a nosedive and plunged by 25%.

My gut says it's just a Wall Street shake off by institutions trying to shake off all the dumb money before going long on this. But I'm also terrified because the next support could be  well below $35 and I may lose 33% of my investing capital.

Do you think it would be a good buy? I'm planning to get in at $43 and exit at $50 in 3-6 weeks. The 52 week high was at $70. Are any pimps involved? Usually a trade of this nature invariably has some element of organized crime involvement where they traffic people never let them leave the business. So is there something of this sort involved?  Ever had a threesome? 1. What's your workout routine like?

2. Is there a need to be fashion conscious or just suit and shoes work?

3. Any preference by clients on body hair? How does it feel to be a gigolo?  How long is your dick?. Do you do anal to or vice versa [deleted] The last sentence in edit 2 though 😂 Econ Grad huh.. 
TN Srinivasan must be so proud from his grave. 1 .Worst experience ?
2.what are some wierd fetish requests you have received from women ?
 Tis a strage thread with a justified poster Guide me sir  Like someone asked what are the exit points u have planned incase of being caught by husband/boyfriend/police ?

Incase of sexual harrassment complaints against you, how are you going to defend yourself ?
 [deleted] What is the average age of your clients? Also what was the age of your youngest & oldest customer Tips for better dick health. What’s the yearly earning potential?

What’s the monthly expense? Include grooming, clothing, food, toys.

What’s the upper weight limit for this job?

Any grooming tips you’d like to share for ordinary guys who just want to go to work in an office and come back home. What app do you use to text your clients. WhatsApp or Telegram?

By having your number (assuming you use WhatsApp) aren't you primed for having your cover blown by a disgruntled client? What's your fitness routine? Height, weight, bicep size and do u even lift bro? What's the age of the oldest woman you have fucked ? A friend of mine told me about these hen parties she when too. But there were 3-4 guys. Are these parties anything like Dancing Bear, lol? I mean I know how wild they are in the west, but how wild are they in India? any famous or celebrity client? Best of luck for graduation. you doing great mate :) What is the age group of men that your clients generally seek? What does your diet look like? Do women especially the Bridge have sex with you at bachelorette parties?  Do you write @ ISS(Indian Sex Stories) ?
If not, start doing so.
 What were the kinkiest demands of your clients?  1. Have you been in any situation where they physically hurt you? 
If no, what would you do if you encounter such situation? 

2. What are the scene of cuckold in India? I have seen a huge number of cuck accounts in Tumblr. Most of them are paid couples. 

3. Would you recommend anyone else for this thing? Why? 

4. Do you think someone should get into this just to fulfill their fantasies/kinks?

5. Are most of your clients rich?

 I'm assuming your clients are mostly rich women. What is the age range, relationship status that your clients come from? Are they mostly married, unsatisfied women, as pop culture would have us believe? Or are there young women too?

What kind of demands do they place on you? Just sex? Or is emotional intimacy, companionship a part of the deal too? Hey good to here that you are doing great in the industry. I have tried to become one of you but the agents online are the scammers and i have been looted . They ask for pre meet money or membership fees.

I thought you may help me out by sharing something so i could aslo be like you .... Plz do reply!! Fake Title should be 'me trying to earn internet stranger's trust to get some desperate aunty pussy' posing as a 'professional gigolo' Tell us about the clients, are they physically gross. How often do you turn them down? Ever felt guilty or ashamed of yourself ? Do you feel uncomfortable facing mirrors sometimes ? 

No, I don't mean to humiliate you . Just asking about the guilt psychology. Do you think you would not need such meaningless extra jobs and would earn a decent living with NGO and think tank work if you were living in a Marxist Utopia? Why though? Can you show a full body pic of yous minus the face? I'm honestly curious to see how you look since this just seems a little too out of my imagination (I'm from a very sanskari family and an ugly women repellant so u r basically my opposite) PM me if you don't wanna post here How exactly did you end up in this situation? Why not take a regular job like BPO/KPO/ bank sales instead? I have links to real life Indian gigolo videos. I cannot post them since I am in office right now. Please remind me to post them in a few hours. How far people go to get attention from internet strangers. First of all what do you think of our country current economy like will it improve or will the currency still fall. Also another question I have might seem a bit desperate but I still got to ask. You see I am a guy with avg looks and same down there(5inches). You see being on the internet and talking to others has placed a lot of insecurities for me. But I still wanna know the truth. What are the chances if I get married that the would be wife will cheat on me due to lack of sexual satisfaction and can I do anything to change it. Or should I just see marriage as merely a contract and not be too much attached to her and keep an eye on the side for fun myself(not my favourite path since part of me still has this romantic idea of love and marriage,dumb I know but its who I am). Or is it better I remain single? Sorry to ask such a question man but if possible give me a truthful answer. I dont mind even if it is a painful one as a painful truth is better than any sweet lie.",AMA,2018-11-14 17:20:02

Ye beta marwaega hame.  AMA was not worth at all. Actually its us we should be blaming, we kept our expectations way to high. In fact, the whole country should be blamed for calling him the top journalist of the country. He is a top joker and an entertainer, albeit a more dangerous kind.  Very disappointing AMA, just shows how much media has become stooges of one party or the other. [deleted] At least Rahul Gandhi talked about real issues. Women empowerment and youth empowerment are badly needed today. But being more ""pro military"" and ""nationalist""? And this is a guy who mocks intellectuals for being out of touch with reality.

P.S.: If **Imran Khan** is viewing this post through his **alternate ID** then please please please call him and tell him that randia is calling. Thanks. :)",pikettier," I just want to know if Imran Khan is still lurking on randia. I just want to ask him what movie he was promoting when he started the whole thing about fairness creams.

Also, I loved Our Lucky Lucky Oye so much that I watch it every month. [deleted] I hope he remains Abhay during the AMA instead of chickening out and giving a Sunny picture of Bollywood.

**Edit**: Explanation for /u/nitrozipp3r, /u/Lurkingtwerker, /u/tintin_007, /u/USpolitics2017, /u/TheComingOfTheGeeks on Imran Khan and /r/India:

[Actor Imran Khan did an AMA here 3 years ago (Wow).](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/236bpy/hi_reddit_longtime_lurker_first_time_poster_imran/). Apparently he had been using Reddit India for a long time with an anonymous account that no one knew. People enjoyed his AMA and he put himself forward as someone who was different from other Bollywood people and was willing to criticize it. This earned him a lot of fans here and he started commenting regularly on his AMA account.

 His comments got a lot of attention and people were acting starstruck, commenting with awe on his every word. Eventually some people began to dislike him and call him a hypocrite e.g. posting pictures of him on set with a poor servant following him around with an umbrella etc. 


Around this time, Priyanka Chopra did an AMA on /r/IAMA. /r/India was mad because she paid money to have a road named after Her deceased father. There were some legitimate criticisms but also a lot of irrelevant and cruel comments. The AMA was a disaster. Imran Khan later said that he would ask Vir Das to do an AMA. He posts the screenshot of a text where he asks Vir Das to come over.

His account suddenly disappears after a few days. 

**The commonly accepted theory:** He voted on a linked thread. This is a reddit taboo and gets you banned. I disagree because there's no source for this claim. How would someone else know that he vote brigade? 


**What I think**: A guy asked him whether he will name a road after his newborn daughter like Priyanka Chopra did for her dead father. IMO this was the final straw for him from his growing number of critics here and he deleted his account.

He probably still comments here from an anonymous account but this is one of the great mysteries of /r/India. If anyone has more info on this, please comment. 

Also, it looks like I'm an /r/India veteran now. Damn.  I am going to message him on FB asking for an AMA. :) 1. Identify topic most vocal section of social media passionate about
2. Go with the bandwagon
3. Publicity. Good try Abhay Deol! [removed] AMA with him will be great. Good idea. Upvoting for visibility  One man does virtue signalling - and we MUST speak to him. Have you guys never heard of a public relations campaign?  What's Abhay Deol's opinion on stalking women ? People over here conveniently forget that he acted in a movie where the male protagonist stalks the heroine in order to woo her. Anyone remember Raanjhanaa ? Can someone ask him on my behalf how many movies he's acted in where he hasn't used any fairness-inducing agent? Get arjun rampal too for that matter",AMA,2017-04-16 09:45:02

Why did you decide to take up social work after spending your entire life working in the corporate sector? What flipped the switch?
2. Of all the social causes you could have taken up, why HIV prevention among sex workers?
3. Considering how taboo sex is in Indian culture, how were the reactions of your family and friends when you decided to work with sex workers? Hi. Congratulations on the success of Avahan!

My question is - 
Most of the problems plaguing the country at this point, be it education/public health/climate are systemic in nature. Successfully solving these problems, that too with a consulting toolkit can be a very hard task. For those of us who’re young, inexperienced and want to carry out such projects without deep knowledge of how tangled they are, what suggestions would you offer? 

Also, other than HIV, what according to you is the other big problems that we all should be working toward? Signing off for now!
Thanks for all those questions, and I'm on twitter at alexander_ashok.
If you have more questions ...well read the book :)

Bye Here is a recent [article](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/13/the-untold-story-of-how-india-sex-workers-prevented-an-aids-epidemic-ashok-alexander-a-stranger-truth) in the Guardian about the journey what leadership havr you seen come up due to your efforts? My book is not so much about HIV and many of the  questions are …
Its about the power of communities of the most marginalized women to solve huge problems..there's a revolution hidden in that

Its also about a personal journey, the adventure within us, waiting to be had...

its about another India, shocking and also inspiring we never see..

i'd welcome questions on those lines too... I’ve heard from my friends who’re at MBBs that it’s not a cakewalk, you must have worked really hard to be there in the first place and to survive and grow as well. How challenging is it for a person like you to run an NGO like The Antara Foundation and work at the grassroots level in a sector like healthcare? What were the difficulties faced and what was/is the motivation to keep going? Hi Ashok, /u/struggle_r asked the following questions -- 

> Hi Ashok! First of all, a big Thank You. People like you who tirelessly work towards betterment of downtrodden and society at large are the real (unsung) heroes.
>     
> 1. What are your thoughts around BMGF hiring consulting cos for ""projects""?
>     
> 2. If you were given an opportunity to address one problem in Indian society, what would that be? Despite progress and change in social attitudes towards HIV/AIDS, there is yet a lot of stigma that surrounds this health issue. Based on your Avahan experience, what solution would you offer to break this taboo?  What's your view on the recent Trafficking Bill being introduced? Is there any truth in reports claiming that it might end up [targeting sex workers?](https://qz.com/india/1499242/indias-proposed-anti-trafficking-law-may-hurt-sex-workers/) Hi, thanks for taking out the time for doing this.

How would you rate the current situation that we as a country (and the healthcare sector) are at when it comes to tackling the societal aspect of the disease and the taboos associated with it? I believe there is a tremendous amount of work that PSM (preventive and social medicine) can do to make things even better especially when it comes to reaching out to the sex workers and providing them with better support.

Also are there any CSR projects that are looking into this? Hi Ashok, welcome to reddit! What is your experience working with public servants? Do they cooperate? Do they hinder progress? Did you have to work closely with governments?  Many people are not aware about PEP, how do you create awareness about that ? What are your thoughts on legalization of prostitution in our country? Do you think it would help tackle the situations regarding the welfare of sex workers ? [removed] [removed] You did this under the aegis of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Note this is just an announcement, the actual AMA will be posted at the earlier date and time. Please direct your questions to that thread. 
",root_su," I wonder what they have to say about this comment by Arnab G:

>As for the Wire, please refer to the above and check the nationality of its editor.
 The good news is that it can't get any worse than Arnab's AMA. Can someone please ask these questions for me? I won't be free during the AMA.

1. Are you aware of the heavy tilt towards opinion/analysis pieces in The Wire's overall content mix? Do you plan to fix it, say with more reportage, or are you comfortable with staying in the analysis space?
2. Does The Wire plan to become financially self-sustaining at any point? How?
3. Why should someone read The Wire over Scroll or Firstpost or HuffPo or any of the others? Is there some differentiator you are aspiring towards? (I say aspiring because it isn't obvious to me that there is one at this point.)
4. For Siddharth V: I heard there was cheering and clapping in the hallways when you were sacked at The Hindu. What went wrong? Ohh wow, this is superb. Good job mods. Yes. Yes. Yes. I hope they try to answer all the quality questions unlike Arnab G.  This good, please bring Ranga uncle some time. Oh these are the founders of the wire. Now I understood  visible bias in their stories.  Dear mods, can you put a limit on the number of questions asked by a person. 
It just defeats the purpose of an AMA as it is for a short duration and you have people asking 5-7 questions in a single post.  Will they answer how their website is peddling fake news like this one: http://www.opindia.com/2017/05/how-fake-news-about-rss-linked-org-promising-fair-babies-was-invented-by-media/ Atleast We will get answers now.
And they will trigger so many people.

Nice work, mods! Finally some real journalists for AMA!

Edit: And please no toothpaste me namak ya gau-mutr like questions this time.BC Arnab ne apne AMA wahi ek question sahi answer kiya tha. What do you have to say about you being called Urban Naxalites? When you walk through the garden, you betta watch yo back! Shit Such a great chance for a AMA and I will be stuck in a bus after giving my MHCET.  Wasn't violation of r/india by Arnab enough? /s This will legitimately give this sub a boner. Expect rank hypocrisy and a complete reversal in attitude from the Arnab AMA. 

These two journos are as biased and intellectually mediocre as Arnab, but because their bias is hard left and virulently anti-BJP/RSS/'Brahminical hegemony'(The kind of nonsense terms The Wire was spewing after BJP won the UP elections defying their predictions) it matches the majority of posters here and therefore these two will be automatically regarded as the role models of 'neutral' Indian journalism. loved the show. Some one should ask M K Venu regarding his UP election analysis and predictions isn't SV from The Hindu group ? Let's please separate the government from the nation. Just because the Wire criticises the government does not mean they're criticising the ""nation"". Secondly, even if they decide to criticise the nation, they have every right to. That's what freedom is about. I've been reading the Wire since they launched and rather than criticise, they're doing some stellar journalism and touching upon areas such as science much better than literally every mainstream newspaper in India does. Looking forward to this AMA and it'll definitely be better than that exasperating farrago of ducking, weaving and dodging that Arnab's AMA was.

Commercial Pilot Questions,5,8rc0rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8rc0rn/commercial_pilot_questions/,6,"Hi,

Do we have pilots here? Especially anyone in airlines like KLM, Emirates, Etihad etc.

I have a bunch of questions pertaining to career switch. I'm a software developer with a lot of interest in becoming a pilot, and a ~~stockholm~~ imposter syndrome. I just feel I'm not that of a good programmer.


1. I have a -3D eye prescription (after lasik but) correctable using glasses. Would I still qualify?
2. I'm 29 so by the time I complete training + 2000 hours I might be 31 or 32. Is it too late already?
3. Is it easier to find a job internationally? I make about €7000 a month but with a job in Emirates or likes of it, I might make about €8000 or more with the cost of an abnormal work schedule?
4. Also, is it worth it financially? I think I might spend €100k to receive a slight bump on my salary.
5. How is the work life balance? I know pilots work in shifts but on an average do they work more than 40 hours a week or less?",AntiNationalDesi, An Indian origin pilot did an AMA here couple of years ago. Please do a search.

We have an AMA scheduled with SM Hoax Slayer. It is a social media platform which works to dispel hoax and fake news, especially those that are extensively spread over Social Media like Facebook, Whatsapp and the like.

 It has over 55000 followers on facebook and has been prominently featured in various newspapers who have also quoted it as a source to dispel fake stories. The founder has also delivered a talk at TEDx Surat on the topic of fake news and the need for critical thinking and common sense when it comes to believing what you read or see on the internet.

Trying to be a smartass here: They will try to break you down in your training, change your individuality/past history and reshape you into what they want from a Civil Servant.

Please continue having the mentality of an aam admi/common citizen rather than a person of authority.

'Sacred Games' AMA with Vikramditya Motwane and Varun Grover,292,92lsbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/92lsbe/sacred_games_ama_with_vikramditya_motwane_and/,530,"We are:

Sacred Games show-runner + director Vikramaditya Motwane (Earlier, Director of Udaan, Lootera, Trapped, and Bhavesh Joshi)

and Sacred Games writer Varun Grover (earlier writer of 'Masaan' and lyricist of 'Gangs of Wasseypur', 'Ankhon Dekhi', Dum Laga Ke Haisha' etc)

We are here to answer questions about our recent Netflix series 'Sacred Games' - the first Netflix original from India.

Note: No questions regarding speculations about future seasons will be entertained.

UPDATE: Hi this is Varun Grover. Am stepping away for now. Will come back to answer some more later tomorrow. It was great fun. Thanks for your enthusiasm and love.

UPDATE 2: Vikram Motwane has also logged out. ""THANKS GUYS!! this was great. Will do it again sometime. Thank you reddit."" ",vidushak," Thank you Varun and Vikramaditya for taking out the time to do this. It was a lot of fun interacting with you guys.

The AMA is over for now, Varun might drop in and reply to a few more questions later. Could there be a separate Netflix special of Katekar * No questions.
* Just came here to read and say thank you to both of you for such an amazing show. What happened to the guys who were locked by Anjali Mathur? XD Kukoo being discovered in the men's washroom. why would she not go the female washroom (and successfully hide her secret)? 
was it just for the audience (exposition)? What was so special about Sacred Games that you decided, yes, this is the one on which we'll make a TV series?  Sartaj is so morally upright - In the book he does take the occasional bribe / Hafta & the series doesn't  show that, Some petty corruption by policewalas is generally accepted without any judgement even in real life too, So why paint him so White?  THANKS GUYS!! this was great. Will do it again sometime. Thank you reddit.  Hey u/vmotwane , a personal question. 

**Who is your favourite character?** And what makes him/her your favourite? When and will the OST of the show be out on music platforms?  hello all. great to be here!!! Max Mueller said that **""Mythology is a disease of language.""** That human beings have a habit of creating ideas/things and worshiping them as real things (reification).

Is there no way to counter the power of these tribal tendencies? Are we stuck between religious symbols  on one hand and patriotic/nationalistic symbols on the other?

What do you think about Yuval Noah Harari's hypothesis in Sapiens that myths are necessary for large number of humans to co-operate? Sartaj = Sacred, Gaitonde = Games? To Vikram, thank you for udaan. it's beautiful. I have seen it many times and actually showed it to my parents. they have now become your fans as well. :) The actor who was most likely to burst out laughing during a take? in first episode gaitonde's eyes are closed when he shots himself and they are open when sartaj looks at him again.....just tell me is this thing intentionally done for the story or is it just a creative touch to depict his background voice...2 din se sapne me bhi yehi doubt aa raha hai...just clear kardo The scene where Isa's men hit Gaitonde's home and he has to defend had a similar vibe to the scene in Gangs of Wasseypur. Was that intentional? Can you tell us the story of how Jitendra Joshi got casted as Katekar. Hello!

1. Why Zoya's characters look much younger than she actually should be acc. to the timeline of this series? Even Gaitonde, that marathi lady and also Sartaj's mother should've looked a decade older than they did in the 2018 storyline.

2. Why the present arc was set in 2018 instead of last decade?

3. What's next? Can we expect any announcement regarding any upcoming webseries soon? Have you ever seen pirated version of Netflix shows? Varun, the show had some extremely creative cuss words. Who comes up with them? How much of those are improvised? Bunty as a character hardly had any redeeming quality to him unlike Gaitonde and yet he managed to be quite charismatic and a treat to watch. How did you guys pull that off?  Varun what went into changing the timeline of the book to present day? Mumbai has changed so much since the book was written and so has technology what kind of impact did it have to the story in your opinion? Is Gaitonde Arun Gawli? * Why did you guys decide on historic episode names rather than going for standard ones ?

* Also, bit unrelated, but when can we expect Bhavesh Joshi sequel ?

* If not Nawazuddin, who do you think would've done the same amount of justice to Gaitonde's role as him ? What benchmark did you set to evaluate Sacred Games post season 1? Since it is a completely different medium for the both of you how do you judge how successful season 1 was? Any other book that you've read/know of that you would want to see adapted into an Indian web series, regardless of whether you're a part of it.  What's the most legitimate criticism are you working towards improving in future seasons? I love the portrayal of women in the series. There are hardly any movies or TV series which show such wide roles of women in a story. We have a mother, a whore, a girlfriend, a god mother, a lover, a goddess, a RAW officer, a divorcee, an actress, a wife, a sister. Each playing an important role in their life or of the men attached to them. I believe the book has to be credited for it. Why do you think we don't see this more often in Bollywood or even Hollywood Cinema ?  [deleted] Hi Sirs !
Congratulations on your success! God speed!

Q. Since both of you have worked in making of a movie, how was it different from making a Netflix series ?

Q.How much did the fact, that there is no CBFC to crap over your work, help you in expressing your artistic ideas ? Varun: Are you a full time writer now ? Given the success of SG. Or when is your next stand up tour planned for ?  Who came up with the idea of casting saif ali khan Did you give the actors any tips about their characters before the shoot? Did you advise them to read the book or put their own spin on the origin material? Please tell us a bit about the global response/feedback that Netflix would have received and may have given you specifically about the language. Because I have a feeling that the English audio and subtitles were not upto the mark. Even the folks in North India seems to have had issues understanding the Mumbaiya Hindi used. Could we get both of your views on that please. This is something I was thinking of when I watched the show. How did you expect the general public to react to the various sex scenes and nudity ghat show contained? Did you think you might have to answer to some random FIRS which are filed in the different parts of the country. Also - did you not consider the censor board threat?  Varun bhai, woh sab chhodo, ye batao ki Lucknow kab aa rahe ho? Hey Varun, which particular actor surprised you the most with their performance in terms of taking your writing to the next level just with their performance? A character that either of you wish didn't have to die so soon purely because their future arc could have been really interesting to explore? Hi, when Zoya reads the news of Gaitonde's death on Twitter, the tweet below the news tweet is a real tweet from November 2013 but story's timeline is June, 2018. So is that a random minor error or a reference to something? (Link to the tweet - https://twitter.com/naveen/status/403280901498368001?s=19) Malcolm is one of the most intriguing characters in the show, What made you cast Luke Kenny as Malcolm? (He was awesome)  
 Hi Varun/Vikram,

I liked Sacred Games a lot and cannot wait for the next season. My questions are:

* What were a few things in your vision that you could not pull off in Season 1? 
* What were some of the the constraints you faced while making SG S1?
* Are you working on any other projects with Netflix? (would love to see this partnership continue)

Regards

FAN  Hey! Hey!

First things first, kudos for the excellent work! Loved it!

Question: Radhika Apte says: get the IFS list. Gets someone named Sharma. Then says on the phone **""Sharma matlab Trivedi"" How?!**

Nameplate outside Trivedi's residence and everywhere else says Trivedi. Then why and how is Sharma is on the list. Why Sharma == Trivedi? The AMA is verified How is working with Netflix? What was the conversation in Writer's Room about Katekar's Death? Did you ever consider not killing him? How Killing him helps the Story? Couldn't you have used a lot more of him in future episodes? When will the music from Scared Games going to get released?(especially the intro music)

Do you think the story has enough fuel to make it through 4 seasons?

BTW I loved Trapped and thought it was more haunting then most of the horror movies in Bollywood. Also can you ask Anurag to release the remixed song ""Mere pairon main"" used in Mukkabaaz since it was pretty  dope. Hello Vikram and Varun,
I loved the show. Was your creative process for the show different from directing/writing a feature film? Which one do you prefer?  Hey Varun & Vikram, Hope you had lot of fun making Sacred Games. The background music was amazing & I have some doubts, problems with show but one basic question I have is this : Can you please tell me the reason why Sartaj was not killed immediately after he was caught by Mourad's men. What's the logic behind keeping Sartaj alive and Mourad torturing him? 

 Why is trivedi referred as sharma If babaji's bodyguards only rescues gaitonde how does matthu survive those men? (As he is in the opening scene) Hi! I liked Sacred Games, especially how every element had a lot of thought behind it. 
the 

There is this one thing which was baffling: how realistic was the portrayal that Gaitonde didn't know Kukkoo was a transgender, even after having sex for months? Did you expect the whole ""Rajiv Gandhi"" backlash? How come Trivedi and gaitonde were wearing the same kurta I still got goosebumps while watching chasing scene of Udaan, Thanks for that movie. Saif in his recent interview with Rajeev told that you MIGHT not direct the season 2 ? Why the fuck ? 

If Netflix brings in David Fincher/James Watkins and asks you to step down from director of SG season 2  ? Would you do it ?

Wouls you trade it for one episode of Black Mirror ?

P.S please don't do it for the world. We love you. Any recent Hollywood film you loved? As I have not read the book, is the story long enough to cover the four seasons planned?

For me this series was right up to the level of Breaking Bad and am really excited for season 2. Hey varun ,which genre you feel you have not explored and would like to do it the future? How can one pitch a show to Netflix? Kudos on the awesome series guys. Here r my questions ;

Did u expect this level of positive reception?

What's the timeframe you're targeting for the release of second season?  Hey, so when can we expect the ""Desh Sankat Me Hai"" promos for S2? 
 Vikram: I've been watching your movies for quite some time, from Udaan, to Lootera to Sacred Games. But frankly I had no picture to the name. Have you started coming out more and giving interviews a lot more than earlier ? Or is it just the success of the show that has pulled you out of your closet ?  Who exactly was Subhadra?
Kantabai's daughter? Hey guys, it's great to see so many characters and actors getting their due appreciation. Although I think Kanta Bai is an interesting character who deserves a better arc. Wish to see more of her in the upcoming seasons. 
 I really loved the design and references to mythology that you guys have on the show and the title/titlecards, Whose idea was to incorporate these elements in the show? They added a great new dimension which we rarely see in Indian shows. Did you think of casting Nana Patekar in the role of Gaitonde? Personally I felt Nawazuddin's 'physique' didn't match his 'stature'. IMHO. The character of Anjali Mathur is said to have been quite different from the book. Why was the decision to make it a ""feminist"" kinda character made? Amidst characters with very region-specific characterisations, Radhika Apte's character had no notion of religion or upbringing in a specific geography, etc. (e.g. Sartaj being a Sardar, Gaitonde being a Hindu from Maharashtra) Was that an intentional characterisation of her, given that she was a RAW agent? Her role somehow seemed unchanged from Lust Stories to Sacred Games. For Varun \[@vidushak\] - Who do you rely on to proofread your writings, to find gaps if any, to suggest improvements? Hi, could you please tell us about the casting, how were the actors decided and were there any compromised done? Saif Ali Khan did a great job imo. What made Phantom venture into the horror genre and produce Ghoul on Netflix? Vikram, as a creator, how much of an impact did you think the background score have on the final product? Top 5 foreign movies(non-English) you've watched? To VG: did you write any sequence that had to be altered on screen because of volume/intensity of cuss words?  What's with the colour palate/tone of the film? Was it your choice or its dictated by Netflix?  Hi Vikram and Varun Grover, I haven't read the book but I think the character arc of Sartaj Singh is very similar to a real life filmmaker. Sartaj witnesses that Parulkar killed Junaid even though he wasn't armed etc. Sartaj gets angry and walks out of the hearing, since can't see injustice happening etc. But much later we see Sartaj becomes part of the system and gives the statement in favour of Parulkar. Thus he empowers Parulkar. Probably Parulkar was aware that nothing will happen to him and everyone will favour him and hence committed the crime (no matter how honest any of his colleagues are). This is very similar to filmmaker who came to know that his partner(a filmmaker) was involved in sexual harrasment, got angry, wanted to set things right but eventually favored his colleague and let him continue work, thus becoming part of the patriarchy system and ended up empowering his colleague. Curious to know if the arc was inspired by this real story?  Will we get OSTs on digital platforms for the series? Smart thinking on having Divine for Kaam 25, he is fire. Hi Vikram,
I want to know if that glass wall in Gaitonde's hiding place was inspired from the glass wall of Jimmy's office in Better Call Saul? (link- https://imgur.com/96ii4pj)  Hey Vikram, any of your favourite scenes that didn't make the final cut? Can you share anything about them? I love Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad and Better call Saul (I heard Mr. Motwane does too). Specially love how these two use some simple, recurring personal conflicts as the core without needing to add new conflicts every episode or season.

With the nuclear coming in I’m afraid season 2 might get even more over plotted. I hope Im wrong (I should read the book for the answer?) Any adjustments you guys plan to bring to the writing? I’d be super curious to know. When do we expect the Second Season ? 
Any tip from Netfilx side ? 
 1. How exactly are we hearing Gaitonde’s narrator voice after he has killed himself? Is all this exposition happening in Sartaj’s imagination? Or did Gaitonde have so much time on that phone call to tell him about all of this?
2. Really appreciated the fact that everybody spoke in their native languages. But I felt that principle was broken by having Gaitonde speak so little Marathi. Was this deliberate? If so, why? Hey. Who was the most fun person on the set?

Sacred Games is a masterpiece. I loved the show and would like to see more of Sartaj soon. Hello Varun, Vikram! 
Here are my questions for the both of you

1. I admire your writing for its consistency and nuanced attention to detail, but I connect the most with the emotional depth and honesty.
My question is how do you choose where to draw the line in terms of emotional honesty, or at what point do you find it to be counterproductive, as far as character growth is concerned? 

2. Has there been anything that you've pitched and Netflix has protested? Or do you have full creative control over the show? Greetings! Thanks for doing this!   


For Vikram - Favourite memory working with Anurag Kashyap?  


For Varun - Which movie has inspired you?   


Again,thanks for doing this and absolutely loved Sacred Games! Cheers!  Some dialogues seemed directly derived from the stories behind the episode titles - was that a consciously done or is it just coincidence?Example: [np.reddit.com/r/sacred\_games/comments/8xo7z6/appreciation\_correlating\_episode\_titles\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sacred_games/comments/8xo7z6/appreciation_correlating_episode_titles_to/) What did inspire the fake encounter sub-plot? On one hand we see you guys launching so many talented actors (especially women) here with such a strong cinema and brilliant story, and on the other hand Bollywood couldn't even manage or better spoiled a good story (sairat) just to launch some dumb ass star kids. Your take on this. Of course I am talking about your opinion on Nepotism in Bollywood.  Hello to both the lovers of the art. My question is for both of you -

Do you had many of the parallels/references, that are coming out now about particular scenes, in your mind right from the beginning? The best one I saw was Gaitonde the young kid saying - ""Apun ko naya dharam mangta tha"" to Buddha going out in search of truth, and *founding* buddhism.

 Hey guys, loved the series.

Mainstream Bollywood still seems to live in a dream world of rich kids facing limp conflicts. Rural India is shown as clean, colorful with its own set of 'cliche' issues. Any body who has traveled into even urban rural areas knows how dirty and grimy it is.The romanticization of shitty things in India ('The Spirit of Mumbai!!!') has gone too far. Our people always attend movies where everything is rosy and the fucked up things in our country are shown as memes unto themselves. Movies in a lot of ways define culture and mainstream Bollywood seems to not understand this. They think entertainment is innocent. Any thoughts regarding this?

In the endeavor of articulating our present state, how  were you able to pull off the veneer and not fall into the trap of glossing over the 'dirt' in our society, but actually baring open for all to see the 'real' side of India. Are you also writing or creating keeping in mind the dire need to articulate our society and get people to finally see the gaping holes in a rapidly decaying culture?

Apologies if this comes off as rambling, but would love a  conversation around this. Subhadra in one of the episodes speaks about the Ganpati festival and what it means to the people celebrating it. It made so much sense and Rajshri, I believe took it to next level. Wanted to know whose idea it was? It was a brilliant monologue! Hey Varun,

No questions, just a big thank you for writing Masaan. It is my favourite movie of all time, and I've lost count of how many times I've watched it now.

Thank you! @Varun - Whens the next aisi taisi democracy show happening?

@ Vikramaditya Motwane - thank you for Udaan and Lootera. that's all.  Hello Vikram and Varun.

I love how mythology is used in the show. Which chracter from Indian Mythology so you find the most interesting and why? In retrospect, what things would you change about Season 1? This is to both of you. (Don't say nothing) Vikram, a lot of the outdoor night scenes used had a lot of obviously yellow lighting. Apart from the obvious street lighting aesthetic was that a deliberate creative choice to set a particular tone? While I loved Sacred Games, I found it disappointing that every time a female character gained any importance, she was killed off. Can we not have that future seasons? What was the overall budget of SG ? How does it compare to a typical Bollywood movie ? Hey, also I was wondering. In writing for the show, where did you look for inspiration? What films, stories, serials if any helped shape your idea for telling these stories?   Why are you not directing season 2?
Why did Ganesh kill chota badariya? Hi Vikram, Varun! Here are the questions:


1.
Many artists keep to themselves and their team so that their creative process is not diluted. You on the other hand are pretty much active on social media and also end up acknowledging reviews, fans, criticism. Does the response help you change your process or would you rather stick to your conviction?

2.
Hey Varun, since you are back in the stand up, do we expect a special from you? 
Also who are your favorite upcoming stand up comics from India? I loved the series and it's many layered narratives . When can we expect the next season ? Hi Varun & Vikram, Excellent job with the script and direction. I wanted to know Who wrote the dialogues for the part Anurag directed?  1. Can you talk about your inspirations for the visual look of the series? I feel Sacred Games really embraced the dingy, 3rd world tube light lighting prevalent in India. 

2. Does the director take HDR into consideration while planing the shots with DP? Your favorite TV show and movie? Hi Varun,

Will we any comments on recent Indian political history in the show?
May be between the period 1995-2015? I was wondering why Gaitonde's Hindi would have a North Indian accent as opposed to having a strong Marathi slant given his background and upbringing. Was it considered? Which is your favourite TV Show other than Sacred Games? Hi everyone, Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap aside, who would be your individual choices for directing the two segments? And can a director affect a tv series significantly given they have tight scripts to follow? Bhagwan mein vishwas karte ho? 

How different or similar is your personal concept of god to the one portrayed in the series?  

 What precautions do you take while writing for the present Indian audience?  

Great work guys it was a liberating experience to have prolonged engagement with realistically portrayed fleshed out characters. Never understood how people get so emotionally involved with a sports team they have no connection with untill I saw the quality product you have delivered and felt a little vicarious pride to be part of the context. Sad to say havent felt this patriotic in recent years.  Was there an option to cast anyone else apart from saif Ali khan as the main lead ? hello , 
 why are you not directing season 2 ? 
Any other book you would like to adapt ?
And why was the relationship with parulkar changed from the book ?
Why was chota badariya killed?

 Hello Vikram, since Varun Grover's razor-sharp satirical commentary on religious fanaticism is exceptionally well, will we see him directing a few episodes in next season?  If Gaitonde is dead, how is he narrating his story?
Edit: A word Have either of you been following fan theories that have going around? How was the experience of making the show with the knowledge that there is no CBFC involved? Did you have any 'quality control' from Netflix side? 1. what guidelines does netflix pass to directors for a series?
1. 
1. what are the ""must haves"" from netflix in the show or each episode? Hi. Big fan of you both. Any chance you would collaborate on a comedy caper (Series or movie)? Almost all the best TV series or even movies are inspired from best selling novels. Does that mean if you want to be a movie script writer, you should probably learn to be book writer ?

Varun defies this statement but is it true in general ?  Off-topic..

What are your fav places to relax and enjoy the vibe? What about script screenplay set design etc?  Favourite Mumbai snack ?  Which disease is Sartaj suffering from? I am really shocked to see Radhika Apte dead in the very 7th episode .. Don't you think her character should be little bit longer ? 
Varun & Vikram i want both's perspective on it  Will you be including Aadil or Mary in the next season? How has the international response been to the show ? I mean do you have some statistics like % of international viewers from Netflix ? top film mate cheers keep it up Varun What level of improvisation happened compared to the script? And comparing the two directors. Hi question goes to both of you, Gaitonde is dead in the first episode then how is he narrating the story? When you guys have specially shown the build up of phone conversation between the two characters. I think you could have find an other way out also Why did Gaitonde kill his mother? What did he actually think of his father? Shit! I missed it! why saif ali khan as a lead ? are you going to reveal sartaj and megha's back story anytime soon? Is there any similarity between the character of Gaitonde and real life Don Chhota Rajan?

Isa = Dawood...? Spin off sartaj singh?  Varun, considering how you've always been an advocate of a gender equal society and been a feminist in general, and taking into account how big an impact hit movies and shows have on its watchers, do you think the use of expletives involving women could have been avoided? Did Netflix impose any sort of restrictions on Sacred Games at a writing/production stage like Amazon Prime Video does? What’s the funniest meme  you have seen about the series? What is the most practical, sensible advice would you have for aspiring writers with no experience in film in this changing media landscape? Hey Varun, a personal question. 

**Who is your favourite character?** And what makes him/her your favourite? There is a character Aadil in the book, which was missing from Season 1 , will that will character come in upcoming season?
And what should we all expect that will come in season 2 .. which will help us fulfill our hunger for season 2 till it comes ? Loved the show, especially the way it was written. It was great to see  the characters speak the way a regular person in their situation would.  But do you ever feel that the ever so creative Indian *gaalis* overshadow the content sometimes?    Hi Sir, Congratulations on the success of Sacred Games. Will both of you also collaborate on Udaan2? When can we expect it to hit theatres?  Was Saif Ali Khan your first choice for Sartaj? I also heard that Saif was the only actor in the whole cast who has read the book? Do you think reading the book gives the advantage to portray the character? Hey guys, I asked Varun the same question last time, so I will spare him this time around.

So Vikram, what's your writing process like, what kind of hours you put when working on a script, how much inspiration you take from your daily surroundings and conversations and what's the greatest screenplay ever written according to you.

Also no niceties for you guys! *Screams katekars name*
 
Nah, just kidding, you guys are awesome, making our movie industry save grace, keep up the great work. How were you guys able to keep up with both the Gaitonde's and Sartaj's narrative together? Was it already decided at the writing stage or was edited later as per the requirement of the episode? Are you guys planning to release **sacred games** Soundtrack?  A lot of hardwork has gone into the making of the show. How much time did it take from Script writing to promotions in total to launch the show on Netflix?

  


Goodluck for season 2. Take your time and make sure it at least as good as the first season or even better. :) What's your response to the courts verdict about you needing to be careful. Will this affect the quality of the show in any way. Hey guys,

Did you all have full creative independence regarding the story and all the scenes shot or were there any restrictions that Netflix put on you or something that you guys thought this was too far.

Btw enjoyed the show and can't wait for the next season.

Edit: The slow creeping shots that setup most of the scenes were amazing, are those ode to your fav scenes in any movies? if yes then what all? Would love to work with this creative team. We are at dire need to change the television content currently broadcasting all over Zee, star, Galaxy and universe.The success of Sacred Games be the bedrock of the new age of Indian Televised Entertainment!
This script is pretty worked on and the scenes are beautifully portrayed. Kudos to the team for the venemous show #sacredgames #IndiaTVRevolution What would you advice amateur screenplay writers who want to make a name for themselves in the future? When will Netflix anounced season 2 or more accurately why hasn't Netflix anounced season 2 ? After the response you've received for the show , how mature do you think Indian audience has gotten over the years? And do you think at this pace, sacred games will be just an average show in the time to come?  Why did gaitonde ended up buying a rolce royce instead of that red car  If someone got a good script how to pitch it to you guys? were you satisfied with the line of dialogue delivered by gaitonde after cuckoo's death where he says ""main bhagwan ke bhi upar h""?

that looked bit odd to me. How's Nawazuddin Siddiqui with nudity Vikram your favourite Black Mirror episode.?? Sorry but the hindi translation seemed a bit off for some crucial moments.

Like when Sartaj or Katekar says आई झवली, hindi captions are हे भगवान. These don't carry the weight of the expression. Do you mind working on this? Found the last episode confusing. It didn't really clear anything for me. I failed to understand so much in season finale. Hopefully next season will clear what's going on. Hey guys, great work on Sacred Games. Thanks for the AMA!

I have a different sorta question - as someone who consumes a lot of Indian movies and series, we've all fantasied about writing a better story/screenplay than some of the crap we see. I know it's much harder to actually write a good story than to dream about it, but what would your advise be to someone who wants to write an original story/screenplay? How should one get it ""out there"" once they are done? Is the best course of action to write a small story and shoot a budge short film? Or just submit stories to the studios directly? This is assuming that a full-time course like AIB First Draft, etc aren't viable right now.  Any of your regular (favourite) food or drink joints where I can find you ? 😛 I am currently reading the book after watching the TV series. I found that a lot of storylines have been changed. For example Cuckoo is a very minor character in the book, Sartaj is not so honest among others. What was going in your mind when you started writing for the show? What motivated you to make some changes? One or two examples will be very helpful!! I just loved the show. Can't wait for the next season. So here are my questions - 

1. Was Saif your first choice for Sartaj Singh? 

2. Did you expect the Bofors line to become  such a big controversy? How did you find Rahul Gandhi's response?

3. Why did you choose Netflix over other online streaming platforms? How was the experience? 

 How much liberty were you given by Vikram Chandra in visualising his book? Did you need approvals from him?  The main villian's every dialogue was very cringy, was it supposed to be so or you guys couldn't find someone else. Hey Vikram, will Bhavesh Joshi Superhero end up saving the city from nuclear attack? You two have been in the industry for a long time now and might have watched many an artist such as yourself still struggling to 'make it' (doesn't necessarily mean creating something as tight and amazing as SG on a scale as large as Netflix, but I hope you get the idea). Is there anything that you did different from these people and would like to share it with young people who are looking forward to entering the industry and beginning their journey as artists?  The fact that Gaitonde killed his mother has left me bewildered. Why did he kill his mother?  What did he actually thought of his father?  for me the best actors were parulkar katekar cuckoo nawajuddin. Why is there no dubbing to other Indian languages? Do add Tamil Varun, who wrote the Marathi dialogues? Some of those puns were really good. I think Saif Ali Khan aka Satraj plays a very little role and its kind of biased to see his name appear first in the name of the actors. Nawazuddin Siddiqui's name should have appeared first. Saif was awesome as a sardarji, can we expect sequel? Great work on the show! Can't wait for season 2.
How can more ""bold"" films and TV shows be brought into mainstream media?  How should aspiring screenwriters, who think they can write a web-series like Sacred Games go about it? Who should they approach? Is Trivedi dead or alive Udaan is one of my fav movies of all time, watched it when i was in college, emotionally attached to it.. thanks for it.

will you release the sacred games OST? How could gaitonde crush the heads of both his mother and the man at the same time Hey, Varun and Vikramaditya! Congratulations on the series. I enjoyed it, but it was more wonderful for me to see how much my parents and grandparents and so many of their friends enjoyed it too. 

What has the response felt like for you so far? Do you also find the show appealing so much to unexpected demographics because of the very specific picture of Mumbai it paints?  Is babaji planning a nuclear attack so that he could predict it and proclaime himself as a godman Where some of the soundtrack in Sacred games similar to soundtracks of Game of Thrones or am I the only one feeling so? @Varun - Kamra, Rathee or you - who will ""called out"" by the BJP first? (cue your youtube comment banter!)

PS - Stellar work guys - have rewatched it twice already! Q1: I feel the character of Sarjat is very lame. He is very mediocre. Doesn't react on time when it is much needed and always ends up in a goofed up situation. Why is it made like that?

Q2: How many seasons can we expect for Sacred Games? I am looking forward to the next one after the cliff hanger by the last episode. When can we expect second season? Is this verified by the mods of r/india or anything? Q1. Did the liberation from censorship actually overwhelm you? like a small kid in a fair?
Q2. What sort of treatment from Indian media were you expecting after the release? Vikram will you be completely involved in the second season? Also have you guys already planned on how many seasons this show will go on for. Huge fan of the show. Congratulations to the whole team.  Hey varun and vikram big fan of the show.


1.My question is will you be loyal to the books written by the author for future seasons or take it another direction entirely? 

2.Are there any plans to bring more such content on netflix from your team specifically in the near future?

3.Were there any  stars you approached before going for saif ali khan for the role of Sartaj?

Thanks for doing this AMA ,you guys deserve all the praise you are getting for this amazing show,kudos! I am curating an Online Treasure Hunt themed on Sacred Games. Would you like to check out the hunt and possibly collaborate to make the levels even more intriguing? What are the pros and cons of working on a series as compared to working on a movie project. What do you prefer and why? When will be season 2 in production? Hey Vikram, Congratulations on the whole series. I loved it. Watched it  twice and would soon go for a third round. Have so many questions but chose 5-6 of them for here. 

How did you decide to switch between the two timelines ? Or was it specified pretty nicely in the book ? 

P.S Posting other questions in further comments.  What's your favorite English TV show of all time?  A question for both of you,

Which books are you reading now ? Was it liberating for you guys? Because you didn't have to deal censorship and all. It felt realistic with the gaalis and the episodes with cuckoo and her sexuality. I really feel this is a benchmark for the coming Indian TV shows or movies. Hi Vikramaditya, I have been following your career for a while and have seen some of your work (Udaan, Lootera and Sacred Games). A common theme has been that emerges is the internal conflict that all your protagonists seem to face (Eg. Ranveer in Lootera, Saif in SG, Rajat in Udaan). Do you do this intentionally to provide layers to these characters or would you say its a fair representation of how humans really are? Looking forward to seeing more of your work! 

And Varun, your Padmaavat stand up piece on youtube has become my go to video when i feel stressed. Thank you for that!  Varun, what was it like adapting from an existing book? How was it different? Did it feel constrained at times? How did you pick the elements you wanted to add/ delete? For the underworld bits, did you take from existing writing on Bombay's underworld? 

 Dear r/vidushak,

You're the best and I've been a fan since much before GoW, Masaan, DLKH etc.

Your clarity of thought is just astounding and I love how you're never ready to take a stand and never late to apologize or learn if you're wrong.

Since I have to ask a question, I'll ask what your favorite Twitter handles are? (Sorry it's just the first question that came to my mind) /u/vidushak, what do you enjoy more, working on your stand up routines or working on movies/shows like Massan, Sacred Games? 

Saw you a couple of times in Mumbai doing stand-up a few years ago, its always fun to watch you :) Some general questions on writing.

Q1. When you people write something original, do you first write in form of a story and then adapt it to a screenplay, or directly a screenplay?

Q2. When you start writing, what is the thing you already have in your mind?? The total conflict? the story gist? Or just like you start and try building the characters and situations with a blank mind?

Q3. What is the difference in approach in writing an adapted screenplay (Sacred Games,  Lootera) to a completely original and fresh one (Masaan, Trapped)?


Thank you. First of Vikram and Varun, great great job you guys. SG has reached cult status. Which new actor has impressed you the most?  Varun ,when did you start writing and what things helped you at the Beginning? How does the budget compare to say an Indian production? Hello everyone .. my question is from Varun ji .. how you're feeling after the great success of the Sacred Games its kind of Indian GoT ! 
How is your experience to co-write the story of not so successful Novel do you expected this much success of serial during writing it ? for u/vmotwane,

After watching the final cut, did you feel that there was something that you could have directed better or with your own perspective in anurag's story arc ? First of all thank you for taking a much needed step of creating a tv series which has all the elements of what a large audience always wanted.

I have two questions here.

First, what is the reception to the show in the industry. Do you think the reception of the show with the audience would help move the money to this kind of content or is this genre still too niche for the industry to swivel towards it.

Second, how is it working with another director. Were there parts where you (question for Vikramaditya) and Anurag Kashyap where  had difference in opinion and how do you come to conclusion to it.

Lastly, thank you again for making this show. I hope to see the third baap real soon. Congratulations on picking up a worthy material and giving Indian audiences something new. But having read the book I think the treatment could have been better and I would like to get your opinion on this. 

I feel a lack of connect with the characters, of course the major characters of Gaitonde and Sartaj have their backgrounds told so we understand their motives somewhat but what about Jojo, Mathur, Kanta bai and of course Parulkar sahab excellent actors all btw. I guess if we could have had a concept like in the show orange is the new black where all such characters had a side track running along with the main track. Taking audiences through their past through which we could understand and relate. 

Also a request I don’t think KD will come in the show but please please put him in one episode as a flashback or something, that guy has a potential for a tangent show all by himself.  Is the home minister trying to defend the attack or he is cooperating with the attackers What's your take on nepotism ruling bollywood? Why are you contributing to nepotism by employing someone who has a series of flops? Will a non-star parivaar actor get a chance after so many flops? 

https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/box-office/article/5-years-7-flops-%E2%80%93-will-kaalakaandi-salvage-saif-ali-khans-sinking-career-graph/187623

The only choice for an unconnected non-star parivaar was Netflix / Webisodes /Youtube and independent directors. Now that you have also shut the door on such hopeful actors. Sir HD link milega with 100+ seeders ? 😂 [deleted] [deleted]",AMA,2018-07-28 20:31:30

update - thanks for the super engaging session folks. if there is any more Q pls do post and I will answer later in the day/tomorrow. Do follow me on twitter - [https://twitter.com/haripyt](https://twitter.com/haripyt) and we can continue the convo there as well! ",hari_ganapathy," a stupid question:

how is your service better/different from thomas cook/SOTC/Balmer&Laurie ? How many times were you close to bankruptcy? When you are bootstrapped how do you decide salary for founders? Saw your website and really liked the interface. tried planning a Euro trip and my questions are based on that relative experience:

1. Am I right in saying that your website does not sell pre -packaged travel packages rather it gives the user an option to select from within the pre-selected vendor options to ""customise"" their tour? So essentially you are a marketplace of vendors with a travel layer on top to facilitate bookings?
2. Your website helps customise an itinerary but optimising the itinerary is still missing anything you are doing to fix that?
3. I tried creating an account but your website seems content to let me plan without creating an account which is good but created an itinerary and wanted to save it by logging in and couldn't do that?
4. If i directly get in touch with your travel experts to help me create an itinerary will they charge me for that..sorry didn't find that info anywhere? 1. What was your toughest customer service experience?


2. What about backpacking options when visiting a country? For example, exploring areas that are not touristy or somewhat secluded.


3. What are your views on legalizing marijuana in India? Would it change tourism sector in any way and would it change your list of offerings?

4. Let's say a tourist is caught for some illegal activity or a tourist loses their passport. How do you handle such unforeseen circumstances? I am very impressed with the website so I decided to see how it works and looked for Newzeland as an option. And next day onwards I am being called by your representative. I received already 3 calls 1 sms and 1 email.  Hello,
As someone who has used this service, I have had a mixed experience. It's a really nice concept to choose the activities and opt out of the things which doesn't seem to interest the individual.
We have had hiccups during the trip planning and the trip. These could have been better - especially the communication with the overseas partners as well as the visa agents and the ones from PYT who was managing our trip (this was resolved after escalations and the agent was changed) 

Also someone was supposed to get back to me regarding an issue but then forgot to, as this was post the vacation. I would have had a better opinion if the person followed through on this than leaving it.

Anyways, my first international vacation was through you guys and I will always remember the good and the bad. 

Suggestion - Improve the collection of preset activities 
 What is the motivation behind this project? Also, how did you get your first paying customers? [deleted] [deleted] Do you consider [Please.com](https://Please.com) as your competitors? Any job openings?  Are you hiring for Digital Marketing? Did the AMA finish? [removed] What are the payment options? Do you support National travel? Are you planning to in future? One thing that bugs me about travel agencies in general is that none of them are upfront about where they get their margins from. If an agent tells me, up front, that this is the itemized bill for your itinerary, plus this is my x% profit, I'd gladly pay up - if I can verify that the items in the bill match whatever I see on [booking.com](https://booking.com) or [hotels.com](https://hotels.com) or wherever.

OTOH if an agent doesn't reveal this, I have no visibility on how much (and where) the travel agent is making his money, leading to the suspicion that I am being ripped off at every point. And if I have to constantly double-check his rates, I might as well do the same thing myself.

I and my family of 4 have made four international trips (two in Asia, two in Western Europe) over the last 9 years, and for the last European vacation we did all the research/online booking/visas ourselves. It was an exhasting/time consuming process, and I would have gladly paid extra for a trustworthy agent. Hi Hari, I am Om. How do you do? Just checked the site and did some planning for trips that i have already done and your costs are pretty decent to be honest. 

Only thing that i would like to ask is how do you handle situation where someone faces some issue with the hotel , where its your clients word against the hotel? And how will u arrange for a hotel in middle of night if the client does not wnat to stay and wants to change the hotel becuase of some valid reason. 

This is most important becuase even  single ruined night will ruin the next few days of tge trip and also your repeat business. Hi Hari, congratulations on accomplishing this huge milestone. I didn't know you guys were THAT old! :-)  
My questions:

* Can you regale a story/anecdote/incident (from a customer's perspective) on how smooth the said PYT customer experience is?
* How has your perspective on personalization and customer experience changed from day 0 till today?
* What plans for the future? What should PYT customers should be excited about? Hey. This is the first time I've heard about the website. Had a look and it looks quite neat. 

How much of your traffic pick from the available packages and how much is custom plans?

What's an upcoming destination request that you get the most in the last year? My question would be at what point after founding the company did you observe a huge influx of customers and also what you think caused that influx ? How far you can provide customized experience in travel?  You will be able to find a very less common interest between an adventure traveller and a honeymooner. The thing that I'm not able to understand is, the interests & expectations of a traveller varies based on their purpose of travel.  [deleted]",AMA,2018-11-28 19:25:29

hmmm
 [deleted] I actually interviewed here in the past. Wasn't a good experience but won't blame it totally on them. 
I think in this business model, only flaw is that the user gets the cashback 2-3 months after the transaction(which is still not sure, like 40% of the times, it gets denied) 
It's a good model but sadly it'll never be scalable to a large audience.   So, reddit is promoting a bunch of highly educated scammers. Nice. FUCK. She doesn't have a wikipedia page. > Swati Bhargava is the Co-founder of CashKaro.com - India’s largest Cashback & Coupons site

Pretty sure coupondunia and mydala are bigger The comments tell me this AMA gon be gooood. This is weak From the comments, it looks like the AMA will be a shitshow and as such I totally expect it to either get canceled or poorly answered. 

I rarely see AMAs on r/india, so to see an AMA like this one surprises me. Mods need to give more details how they chose this to be hosted. Is this a promotion? Does copying an idea count as being called an Entrepreneur?
And no innovation or difference!

1. There seems to be complete radio silence on the Nag program ever since Ajai reported [target acquisition issues](http://ajaishukla.blogspot.com/2012/07/indian-army-and-drdo-co-operate-to.html) in 2012. Is the missile ever going into production, or is it effectively dead?

2. Some news outlets report that the MiG-29K has been a rather poor performer, and that the Navy isn't very happy with it. They say the avionics don't perform as well as advertised, the structure was found to be too weak for repeated carrier landings, and then there was also the CAG report that pointed to atrocious serviceability levels. What's your take? Is this all true or exaggerated?

3. You have been asked to bet the ungodly sum of [Rs. 100](http://imgur.com/W7ATlMi) on the outcome of the single engine fighter competition. Which one would you bet on, and why?

4. If there was one (or a dozen) glaring, commonly-held misconception about the Indian military that you'd love to dispel, what would it be? 


And some questions from /u/IndoAryaVII, who couldn't attend.

> * In this article, he goes on about: https://www.livefistdefence.com/2017/02/exclusive-indias-5th-gen-amca-targets-2030.html - this:

>     >""‘If you consider that the LCA Mk.1 will be built till 2024 and the LCA Mk.2, when ordered, should be built between 2030-35, then 2035 is good target for production of the AMCA,’ Balaji says.""

>     Should it be rather “built between 2025-2035” rather than “2030-2035”? I find it difficult to believe there would be a 5 year gap between Mk1A production ceasing and Mk2 production starting as well as Mk2 development taking 13+ years.

> * And ask him if he has any info on the Tejas Mk2, any spec info at all?

> * And the last 2 questions being, how is the Kaveri-French tie up going along and how is the MII Rafale deal going along? This was great! Thanks for this first AMA. We'll do more soon. Thanks for the questions, folks, and see you soon!

-- Shiv From /u/seb-aur-santare:

How would you deal with Kashmir if given the chance? What do you think are the big changes in Indian defence policy since NDA? Hello Shiv.  Thanks for doing this AMA.  Why would you feel you are qualified to write about defence? Do you have a defence background?  what is the reason for  really  large import inventory  for defence equipment ? are indian  defence manufacturing totally bust ? 

recently their was chatter about ammunition selection? any takes from your side. Why is there so much resistance to induct Tejas and Arjun? Are yardsticks being shifted constantly or are there are genuine problems in the two platforms?  1. what do you think are some crucial defence programs under development for India's future?

2. do you think India already has the capability for MIRV, but is kept under rug? if no, how far are we from having it? if yes, why is it kept a secret?

3. how successful do you  think India's Anti Ballistic Missile program is? will it be successful in real situations? What are your views on Aadhaar with regards to security on the digital frontier?  Via /u/chipsnmilk

>* Thank him for covering the an32 Missing incident when noone else did. One of the pilot was a friend.

>* Ask him about Dhruv or ALH control/design issues, is hal covering them up?
 Can we carry a taser in India for self defense ? I've been following your career Shiv. You have done amazingly!

How is the experience like to be lobbyist, deal broker for Defence companies? Shiv, what are your personal views regarding the recent incident where a person was tied to the Army Jeep in J&K ? Does the defence correspondent Shiv has different views than the person Shiv ? What are your views on India asking for ToT for virtually everything these days? Do you think that India will become a push over in geo-political arena gradually because almost all big powers will be able to bargain with us by throwing ToT cookie? Which sector of our defence capabilities do you consider to be weak?  Hey Shiv,

I noticed that recently during the Delhi ByPolls India Today was more focused on AAP losing than BJP winning (with literally running banners of AAP losing) why do you think that is?

What do you think that Indian News Channels need to do be more truthful rather than neutral in a debate? 
 How to create big Defence Industry in India? also Aerospace Industry of our own?

Surely we cant depend on Importing stuff, should we have special Institutions and Research projects, if no scientists in India why not pay more for foreign scientists to come to India until we develop our Industry.

Should Indians or at least some, have some kind of minimum training like Israelis? 

 Hi Shiv,
What do you make of the Navy's decision to give the NLCA a pass? In your opinion, could the navy have been supportive by placing a limited order and not rejecting the jet completely? Your personal choice between Saab Gripen E or F 16 Block 70 fighter for the Indian Air Force?  Ever since Trump suggested a wall along the Mexican border, his opponents have suggested that there are better ways to improve border security by technological innovations like using drones, etc. 

We share a very hostile border with Pakistan and China, with terrible terrain for soldiers to be deployed. How is our defense handling this? Are there plans to invest in drones for border security? 

Have the Indian defense contractors been reliable in the past?  Hi Shiv, thanks for doing AMA. I closely follow you and all the best for new inning in Livefist.

My question is about India's nuclear counter strategy. I know that our nukes are not always on standby mode, like those of USA's minutemen missiles & erst while USSR or current Russia. We keep nukes separated from launch vehicles. Both are guarded by different departments.

Now my question is, what if in an surprise enemy attack on nation's capital during,say Republic day celebrations, when our entire Civil & Military leadership is present there and is wiped out in one strike, who will than authorize nuclear counter attack?
Do we have any concept like ""Designated Survivor"", in which USA appoints a low ranking cabinet official during their annual State of the Union address when entire Civil-Military leadership gather under one roof so if any thing catastrophic happens on Capital Hill, that designated survivor can command and control entire nation.

Do we have any plan for this scenario?

Thanks. Hi Shiv my defense question is, when do you think India will be able to project it's military like the US, China & Russia does?

Also do you think we should be more involved in international affairs since Sri Lanka intervention left us with sour memories, should it keep us a spectator on an international level? In 2015 Government had ordered setting up Joint Cyber and Special Forces command. What are our Cyber Warfare capabilities and whether Government is still interested in setting up joint cyber command??
 http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=158187
The above report mentions about something called Stealth Wing Testbed (SWiFT) being developed by DRDO. What is this thing??  Are missiles that can reach each and every part of the world really neccessary for India since our main concerns are only China and Pak? Shiv whats the status of LCH IOC and Helina. Can you tell the what is being developed under ANVESHA project. http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=158060 Shiv, what is your evaluation of our cyber security apparatus and preparedness? Not just in the armed forces but in other arms of the government as well What is the straightdope on "" Samba spy scandal""? some questions about ongoing projects of DRDO:
1) Will QR SAM have verticle launched Astra missile System??
2)What is the status of funding of AMCA project? When will Full scale engineering phase start?
3)a committee by MoD will submit a report on FGFA in upcoming months..What do you think will be the most likely outcome??
4)Project to devlop Astra mk2 has started???
Thank You What is your opinion on IAF's single engine fighter program? Will Parrikar's departure from MoD cause it to get scrapped? Are F-16V and Gripen-E viable contenders considering Pakistan's extensive experience with F-16s and Gripen-E's [IOC and FOC being planned only in 2023 and 2026](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sweden-to-boost-operational-readiness-with-gripen-411777/) respectively?  Hi Shiv, thanks for doing this.

1. What are the factors delaying the Strategic Partnership in defense policy and do U expect it to be resolved within NDA 2?

2. Where do our Special Forces fit in the overall mindset of our strategic planners? Can we see increasing role and a SFC soon?

3. With increasing importance of Indian Ocean in India's security matrix and plans for increased amphibious assets, do we have any expeditionary forces in plan like the Marine Corps of the US?

4. Gripen or F-16? :P Your favourite TV series? What is your reading of the situation in Kshmir? Where do you source your Indian defense news from? I understand you are the source for most civilians. But if you had to point a layman to keep track of Indian defense news, which sites or blogs would you point him to?  Hi there, Your tweets are high energy!

Guys, I've not had anything to eat since breakfast. I'll have some dinner and hopefully come back soon!

It's been really cool talking to everyone so far :D

----------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, it's 11 pm here and I need to get some reading in before I head to bed! I'll catch you guys tomorrow if this thread is still interesting to any by that point!**

It was LOVELY speaking to everyone here! Indians sound amazing! Much love to you, all my Bhaarti Dost :D

----------------------------------------------------------------

Sporadically answering questions while at work today. Don't tell my boss, thanks. I think today will be the last day because we're gonna run out of questions soon :D

----------------------------------------------------------------
**LAST EDIT: Hi again! I feel like this has wound down, so I'm going to be off. Here's my last message:**

Thank you so much for making this AMA so much fun! I learned so much about India and I can relate to you all so much! I wish we could all get along better. We are literal kin, far back and deep down. I would love to come to India some day and meet people as lovely and hilarious and curious as you lot! And I'd love it if you guys came down to my country, too!

Finally, I'll leave you all with a quote from A Song of Ice and Fire which reminds me about the partition, and what a tragedy it was, and how we can all strive to do better, and love each other as the brothers and sisters we really are:

>“It all goes back and back,"" Tyrion thought, ""to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance in our steads.”

Let's not be puppets. Let's love and share and break the cycle that has been handed down to us.

Namaste <3",WhereIsLordBeric," Do you place a newspaper as a separator between the wood and your clothes before filling your wardrobe/closet with clothes. 
If so. Why? 



 1. Why's your chai so weak?  
2. Is there a Pakistani equivalent of Bhai?  
3. So I just noticed you're a woman. [Rate me on a scale of 1 to 10](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTydOXAu7Fi1qcTvpN0QaG15uPhbHOD-nfuI11QbuisErM4n81K__Ry6szZ)

the eternal words!

 In India, our parents like to compare  their children with the infamous ""sharma ji ka ladka"". Does this also happen with you too? I don't really have a question, but I just want to appreciate how you've handled this ama so far. Polite replies to curt questions and humbly shutting off the people looking to stir things up. Cheers! I bet it’s a dude baiting for karma.  Hi! 


Could you recommend some Pakistani/Mughlai dishes that I may not have heard of before(as in, ones which are local-pakistani-in origin)?


Also, would you ever want to visit India? 


 How is life in Pakistan? How do your family see the fact that you're 27 and unmarried? They make a big fuss about this in India apparently. Is inbreeding truly common in pakistan (marry 1st or 2nd cousin)? Or it’s just the west trying to dmg the image of the pakistani people. * Have you ever been on a motorcycle?

* Have you been outside of Pakistan or do you plan to ( for travel etc ), to where?

* What's the popular smartphone brand in Pakistan?

* Do you follow muslim dress code? like wearing hijab and all
 Have you seen 'The Office' - US?  Was your family native Pakistani or they migrated from India. Mine migrated from peshawar.  I wanted to ask why do Pakistanis use 'ay' at the end, instead of 'e' or 'ein'? I had a Pakistani friend a looong time back, and type ""miltay hay"" instead of ""milte hain"". ""Baate karein"" to ""baatay karay"". Koi ladki patwa do aap :( What's the difference between you and average Pakistani woman? What are the things about Pakistan you love the most?

What about Pakistan do you dislike the most?

Favourite book? Do you guys have ""Karachi Biscuits""? What’s the dating scene like in Pakistan  I just came back from office and reading this, interesting conversation. Thanks for this. 

Have you seen TV series Mad Man, if you haven't, you must.

I am insanely fasinated by Pakistan, wo kehte hain na: Jis Lahore nahi vekhya, wo janmya hi nai. Ravi to chenab puchdaaaaa, ki haal ae satluj Da 😢 Keeping music and making football aside What else Pakistan does better than everybody else?  1) please recommend some Pakistani books/movies/songs.

2) how much history do they teach in school ? Do they teach about Mughals ? Indian freedom fighters? Would you ever eat bacon?  What were the expectations you had to live up to when growing up (studies, relationships, etc.)? What's your favorite -

1) Food

2) Song

3) Movie

4) Travel destination Welcome to Randia!

My Q is: What were/are you guys taught above Pakistan history and origin in History class in school. IIRC We (Indians) were/are taught about:
1. Ancient India: Birth of religions, Aryans and Vedic culture
2. Medieval India:  Maurya Empire, Delhi Sultanates, Mughals, Kingdoms in South India , etc
3. Modern India: Ideologies and contribution of many freedom fighters in independence of India ( Pakistan) from British India , Independence Movements, etc

History was quite extensive (and boring) for us. Since before 1947 you guys were technically Indians, so are you guys taught about only last 70 years or only about Muslim Movements or about today's India history.

I would really love to hear the answer of these questions from you.

Edit: She didn't answer my question yet but she answered a similar question here https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8w1kbb/_/e1sbo70 This is gold! Hey it was a very funny and wholesome thread. Thanks for doing the Ama here. You live in Pakistan or a foreign land ? And Hindi/Urdu bolni aati hai ? Have a few questions !

* Where in Pakistan you live ?
* Are you guys modern like Indians are ? Full gadgets freaks, sipping cappuccino in Starbucks slowly while reading on Kindle and reply to boyfriend's text on iPhone 10 ?
* Why ladies don't generally wear jeans or dresses etc ?
* Who is that famous chaiwala that won a modelling contract ? Can you complete the following?
Afridi chya aai chi **** How is the current political climate there? [deleted] [deleted] Sadly, the country is going to shit with the current govt. India isn’t what it used to be. If the current govt comes back to power, it would go from bad to worse.

It was great reading ALL of your answers. Thank you for the AMA. I really do hope this is not a fake account!

My question:
1. how often do the youth talk about politics? 2. What’s the Kashmir issue like to the general public? So you have read A Song of Ice and Fire. How would you rank the books in the series from most favourite to least favourite?

For me it is;

1. A storm of swords

2. A game of thrones

3. A dance of dragons

4. A clash of kings

5. A feast for crows.

 Damn a girl on reddit India and I miss out. Outta luck offline and online. Seriously I'm so sad about this irrational hatred seeded by politics between India and Pakistan. Like we're literally the same people.


Anyway, questions!

How is Pakistan for women? Many people have this impression that it's a really shit place for women.


How far do popular Islamic conservatism and sexism pervade up there? This may sound stupid, but how far are women pressured to wear burqas?


Does the average Pakistani dislike or appreciate India? Does this average person care that much about the whole Kashmir thing?


Do you consider yourself to be in the 1%? Can you talk a little about the middle class in Pakistan?


Can you talk a bit about the political situation in Pakistan completely honestly?


Since you like books, could you recommend some books for me to read? 


How far is the internet used in Pakistan? Is it widespread or elite-only?


How tf do your singers have such amazing voices. Atif Aslam is a legend.


Where do you encounter the most misogyny? Online or irl?


Is gaming a popular pastime in Pakistan as it is here? Do you game? If so, what do you play?


Is the 'Girls' School/Boys' School' thing prevalent in Pakistan as it is here to some extent?


What are some other tiny charming differences between our cultures? :D &nbsp;




Thank you for doing this ama, I've always wanted something like this! :) Not sounding creepy even though it is a creepy question but why are Pakistani women so cute ? Really dude I wonder how those cute girls ended there 😭 What did you have for lunch today? What you think of India? Do you make your own food? Do you live with your parents?  Fuck I am late for this AMA. Can you answer these questions /u/WhereIsLordBeric 

1. Have you ever tried Ding Dong bubble gum? How were they? Their TV ad is one of the dankest thing I remember- featuring a cat who was dragged to *jungle* court by 2 lionesses because she stole their *ding dong* bubble gum.
  
2.  Are Square Cut chips similar to Lays potato chips? Their animated ad was pretty neat- a Pakistani cricket player hitting a sixer by using the *square cut* move.

3. Telefun sim card- how popular was it? Did you use it? Their animated ad was so shoddy in quality that the entire music+helpline number is still etched in my mind!
4. Ask me why and how do I know about all the stuff I mentioned above :D

Last but not the least- can I  join your Stardew Valley group?

 Have you seen any bollywood movies? If yes, which one did you like? How is life like for working women in metro cities of Pakistan? 


I loved watching zindagi Gulzar hai and hamsafar. And you guys have the best traditional fashion game! Noone does salwar kameez like you guys! :) I love your food, music, and art. 

Where do you live in Pakistan and how is life at your place? One Indian city you could live in  for the rest of your life. Can you help me get a Pakistani visa? I'm so curious about your country, only visiting it can end my curiousity. Do you like the wheel.of time series also? Are you sort of liberal or conservative? Hoping you are just an aam admi like me, what's the general perception in Pakistan about Indians?

 Furthermore, the hate based propaganda in either country stinks, what do you say? What's the one thing you feel that Pakistani people do really well that people of other nations can learn from? [deleted] If you had to recommend three pakistani movies, what would those be? God, I used to play this coke studio song to death on repeat a couple of years ago

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S5U2GXKBSo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S5U2GXKBSo) 1) Famous veg foods available over there ?

2) Do people also have  'log Kya Kahenge' mentality ? It runs deep in Indians and specially target towards women.

3) What do you think of women following religion considering most of religion are patriarchal in nature and always been used to control women ?

4) Do LGBT people organize Pride Parade in Pakistan ?

5) Is being atheist acceptable in Pakistani society or not ?

6) Are you from Sindh ?

I really love Karachi literature festival. They have awesome talks.    Where do you guys go on weekend trips. We Mumbai people go to Lonavala (google it), is there a similar place around Pakistani cities ? My sister is a BIG fan pakistani tv shows . She thinks they are whole lot better than indian daily soaps. Do you watch any? Is the culture totally different between two different regions (Urdu vs Punjabi speaking) like we have here, North and South India? Do you guys have OTP(one-time-password) there? I had a convo with a Pakistani gal 1-2 years back, she was clueless about it. Are you familiar with girlsatdhabas? What do you think of their initiative?  1. What's your beauty routine?
2. Do you have long hair? If so, do you henna it?
3. Epilators or wax? Not every Indian hate Pakistan or Pakistanis. What's about you guys/girls? Do most of you hate us like the media portrays?  Have you heard of or read Ibn-e-Safi?

As a kid I used to read his spy-thrillers (translated in Hindi) and loved them. Hi There,
Greetings, 

Could you refer some books referring the history of Pakistan. I already know the from the Indian Perspective and i feel a lot of people/Facts have been omitted.

Just one example i know of are the Ali Brothers who have been mentioned of significant importance for the Islamic community in Gandhi Book ""My Experiments with the truth during the Freedom Movement""

Would love to know how its been stated from Pakistan perspective.


Peace Take care.

Would love to visit and explore Pakistan one day(before i die). What kind of clothes do you wear 

A.  At work

B. At home 

C.  While out for shopping.   Are people there also told ""go back to India"", if they say something 'anti-national'? Do you think winds of winter will ever release? [deleted] Dude you just became popular 😂 What are some pakistani songs that you love to hear? (Don't forget to share ghazals) (Political) How has the perception of India amongst your age group and or peers changed in the past few years?  Are didi apki shaadi ho gayi ? Waha pe Mobile data ke plans kaise hai ? Yaha pe ab bahut sasta ho gya hai saare pakistani eese kiyu baat krte hein In case you're still answering:

1. How do you guys generally hang out with friends, partners, colleagues?

2. Sorry for the naivety (or if this is offensive), do you have bars? or just coffee or hukka joints?

3. ~~I saw 'Khuda Key Liye' and absolutely loved it. Any other stuff would you recommend?~~

4. Whats your take on Indian music? Is Bollywood as popular there as we think it is?

5. Do you know much about Indian film-stars? If yes, what would your kill, marry, hookup choices be?

Edit: saw the AMA chain, got answer to 3, unless you have a non-Punjabi film in place of Zinda Bhaag to recommend. what is the stance of women in Pak army? Does the Pakistan Punjab suffer from the same pesticide and farmer debt/suicide issue that occurs on the Indian side? Also, in that region do most people consider themselves as Pakistani or Punjabi if asked about their nationality? Is Urdu more widely spoken or Punjabi? pakistan may life kaise hai A Pakistani woman on reddit wow even my super nerdy friends don't use Reddit I am an Indian living in India, AMA about Pakistan. Why can't pakistani's cook vegetables without meat, why does it have to Aloo Gosht, Dal Gosht, Palak Gosht, Aravi Gosht, Tinda Gosht ? How do I lose my virginity? [deleted] [deleted] Which side of Pakistan are you from?

What's the reason and extent forb the hate Punjabis and Pashtuns have against each other?

P.S ; You're welcome to post on /r/IndiansGoneWild. We won't hold your nationality against you What do you look for in a guy ? What do Pakistanis think of South Indians? [removed] [removed]",AMA,2018-07-04 21:17:08

Came across this while reading the Arushi judgement delivered by the Allahabad HC. Is this sort of language normal in judicial opinions?,42,763vx6,https://i.imgur.com/4xuhppI.png,13,,vibhavp01," The judge who wrote the judgement indicated in an interview that he wanted to use fancy English because the judgement would be widely read. 

Separately, a lawyer’s AMA about a year ago indicated a rise in the length of judicial judgements because a bunch of judges have started filling them with fluff.  Classic case of copy-pasting Synonyms without learning the context in which the words should be used.  I don’t know about ya’ll but I’m gonna use this while sexting.  This bullshit is more common among judges of high courts and Supreme Courts. The judges of lower courts usually don't have the time or the luxury to peddle in such bullshit.  Handcrafted...

"Hello /r/India, I am Tathagata Satpathy. Member of Parliament, Chief Whip of BJD, Editor of Dharitri & Orissa POST. AMA!",636,2z493l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2z493l/hello_rindia_i_am_tathagata_satpathy_member_of/,351,"Hello /r/India,

I am Tathagata Satpathy, elected Member of Parliament and Chief Whip of Biju Janata Dal in Lok Sabha. This is the 4th time I am serving as an MP (12th, 14th, 15th & 16th Lok Sabha). I am a journalist by profession and I am the editor of two newspapers, Dharitri (Oriya) and Orissa POST (English).

[AMA Proof image]( http://imgur.com/rrdJgI9)

At the outset, I would like to tell you why I am doing this AMA. This young man /u/kumbhakaran (*I wonder why but he prefers not to be named*) who works with me and helps me with my legislative work requested me to do this. I agreed. 

After hearing about this AMA format of interaction, I thought it would be a good way to know what people think of the present situation in India. Your questions might be a link to finding solutions to issues that are uppermost in the minds of people of a certain creed. 

Being selfish, I would like to use these inputs sometime in Parliament. I am not sure how this could help improve the overall situation (or solve problems) but Reddit could prove to be an alternative communication channel for me. I am not on Twitter or Facebook. I like the anonymity that Reddit offers. Therefore I have dared to do this AMA here.

My policy team, /u/kumbhakaran and /u/ZainabHameed, will be helping me with this AMA. They will also participate and respond.

**BIG DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this AMA should definitely not be attributed to those of my party and leadership. I am answering these questions as a citizen of India. All views expressed here are personal. Same goes for my staff.**

So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india community. 

*I will start answering questions at 7 pm (IST).*

EDIT (20:01 IST): Thank you Redditors for participating in my AMA and a special thank you to the moderators. If some of you still have queries, please do post them. I will try to answer them sometime during this week. Don't be surprised if you find me as a regular Redditor after this. Amen!

EDIT (19:53 IST, March 20, 2015): I got some brilliant points from Redditors regarding the plight of the farming sector. Yesterday, I had allotted the time of the BJD to a colleague who unfortunately, did not use them. I spoke today (limited party time) and used some of the points in the House. /u/kumbhakaran has uploaded the video already! After a not so busy week in parliament, let me try answering a few more questions.
",tathagatasatpathy," Hello.
It's good to see an Indian MP doing something like an AMA.
I would like to ask you what your personal opinion is about SC/ST reservations in political, professional and educational institutions. 
Do you think they still have any relevance, or has the time for them passed, and they are just being misused now? Do you think parties should reveal all data related to their funding? Thank you for this AMA, sir.

1. I read your [insightful article](http://tathagatasatpathy.com/web/Epidemic.aspx) about the spread of Jaundice in Orissa. There has been much research that uses mobile phone cameras to detect Jaundice, and many apps for doing this have been developed in western countries (predominantly for detecting Jaundice in infants). Some of us would like to work with the health ministry to develop these for India. How can we reach out to them?
1. Do you think that the short-term social ills that can arise from deregulation (like agitation among farmers and tribals) are worth it for the potential long-term benefits? To this end, what are your views on the Land Acquisition Bill?
1. The GDP of Mumbai is more than the GDP of the entire state of Orissa. Orissa has much untapped economic potential (tourism, food processing and manufacturing). Yet, governments in the state have not focused on significant pro-growth reforms - regardless of political affiliation. Why do you think that is the case?

Again, thank you very much for doing this AMA. I hope your example is followed by more legislators in the country. Hi, I am from your constituency. I live in Caltex square area. 

I wanted to ask that [last year the government announced a special job fair](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Students-in-a-fix-over-deferred-dates-for-job-fair-many-cancel-reservations/articleshow/42330062.cms) for unemployed technical and management graduates. 100 INR was collected from each interested student. About 3 lakh students registered as of final count. But, the job fair never took place. Can you tell us what happened to the money?
 What is your party's take on Cannabis decriminalization?  How do you balance editing 2 newspapers and being an MP? How different is the 16th Lok Sabha when compared to 14th and 15th? Better or worse in terms of efficiency of getting bills passed, the general behavior and attitude? Hello Sir,
An article on front page of New Indian express says despite spending crores the state continues to be in the grip of dreaded malaria. Odisha tops the country in incidence of malaria (36% of the whole country). Odisha is also third in terms of malaria deaths. How is the state government going to tackle this problem?

BJD had walked out of the Lok Sabha when  Land Acquisition Bill was passed. Specific to Odisha what are the issues BJD finds in the bill ?

Naveen Patnaik had written to PM to re-examine coal block earmarking process. Again specific to Odisha what issues BJD finds in the coal auction process ? Hello Mr.Sathpathy it is great to have you with us. 

I will come straight to the point. So here are my questions:-

Q1 Last November you spoke about Black Money and said ""Governance and Government do not change according to the political party"" Is this also applicable to your party i.e. BJD which is in the Government in Odisha?

Q2 In 2014 General Elections Narendra Modi's juggernaut swept almost the entire country but not Odisha. Their BJD won 20 out of 21 LS seats. How did your party manage that? 

Q3. When you were speaking on Land Acquisition act you said "" Nation wants to know"". A MP behind you was quick to point out the journalist with whom this phrase is associated. How often does such funny incidents happen in the house?

Q4 What will be your advice for young people like me who want to come into politics? 

Q5 and last question When are we going to see a BJP-BJD alliance again? :P >So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india[6] community. 

Glad to hear that Sir. This is a special opportunity for many of us (one that we might not get later on, so I know that I wish to juice as much info/views i can get out of you).

----

You've been the representative for Dhenkanal for the last 11 years.

* 2014: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal
* 2009: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal
* 2004: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal

**1)** What according to you have you done in the past 11 years for your constituency? And what have you done for the rest? (Please provide sources if u can)

----

**2)** In India atleast, LS RS proceedings tend to be a noisy situation where many politicians engage in hooliganism. Most practically scream at the top of their lungs, disregarding everything anybody has to say. There are many other incidences that just sounds pathetic. IMO (In my opinion) and I'm pretty sure many agree with me on this, It feels pretty sad to see something like this happening. I assume its supposed to show that the politicians are fighting hard for the people they represent, but to many (even if they support our own beliefs) it just looks like the politicians are shutting down every other other views. LS and RS are places where each of the points are supposed to be thoroughly vetted and debated. Screaming helps no one (IMO). Similar to parties walking out. I know its part of tactics where a certain group wants show protest, but not want to disturb political deals. Why can't they have a separate flag that just say they should not be counted while still listening to all sides of the story and participating in the debate instead of walking out on every thing? **What are your views about this?**

----

**3)** What are the challenges that you have faced (not political parties) that have impeded you in your efforts?

----

**4)** If you could create a law that would be implemented (that isn't already), what would that be?

----

**5)** How long do you think will it take for debates raging online to have a VERY sizeable impact in real life politics.

----

**6)** What are your views on the bad Maoist situation in Orissa? Do you feel sections of the proper Indian Military (not CRPF), and Air force needs to be brought in to deal with the Maoist problems?

----

**7)** How would you rate the practices taken by the Orissa government to boost Industries and Industrial growth?

----

**8)** Who do you think acts like an Idiot the most in the LS (in terms of impeding the processes of the LS)

----

**9)** How do you think that being the editor of your own newspaper has helped you in your personal and political endeavours.

----

**10)** Call out some of the bad practices of BJD, or acts that you don't like/support.

----
**11)** Personal question: I've identified myself as a gamer (computer gamer) when i was younger. I still do (but not professionally now due to familial pressure). We see tournaments such as the DOTA2 international which gives out prize money of about (67 crores ->in comparison IPL prize pool was about 25 crores), and many other such for a large number of games. The chances of earning good amounts of money in playing computer & console games on a competitive level is far higher than in most other sports, with a very large audience. And even in case we can't make it to the big league, streaming pays a lot of money. Yet everyone from the government at best does not do much to stop them and at worst erects barrier after barrier to stop people from playing. This is in addition to the bad rep that gaming already has. Many other countries have started organizations to help its citizens in their ordeals - (Especially in terms of procurement of visa etc) Korea, malaysia, China, Canada, America (in the process of creating one). Why hasn't our government even recognized it as a sport?

----

**12)** India is considered as one of the most trigger happy countries in terms of censorship. What are your opinions about that and also in terms of privacy concerns being raised.

----

**13)** How much do you think India is able to handle the American NSA and other such organizations that want to snoop on our (confidential government data + normal everyday data of its citizens) by their projects like PRISM etc.?

----

**14)** What is the question that you assumed  you'd most probably have to face, right before doing this? 

----

**15)**lastly what are your views about memes on the internet and on portals like whatsapp including ones that are probably based on you?

----

***Please answer what you can. Thanks. And Please don't skip the entire thing if you don't want to answer a few of them*** 1) What is the cause of widespread poverty in Odisha even when it is fairly rich in natural resources ?

2) What were other reasons behind BJD-BJP split apart from what was shown in news ?

3) How do you manage to win in a large state like Odisha ? Family name or actual ground work. If latter, any examples ?

4) Are there any people in BJD who want to expand outside Odisha or wish a new BJD-BJP alliance or with any other party ? What is party's official stand ?

5) Compared to rest of CMs, ~~Biju~~ Naveen keeps a low profile and we rarely hear anything about Odisha apart from natural calamities. Reason ?  Thank you so much for doing this AMA, sir.

1) What are the major challenges you see in front of your state right now?

2) How do you rate the current central government? What are the things you like/dislike/want them to do? Specifically, please comment on your stand over the controversial land acquisition act.

Edit: [Your Wikipedia page](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tathagata_Satapathy) says you've spoken against religious conversions. What, in your view, can be done to stop the constant flow of money into the country for missionary work?  Hello, thank you for this AMA, Sir.

Odisha, being part of the ""Red Corridor"" has faced a lot of **Naxalite-Maoist insurgencies** lately.

 What are the reasons that lead people to join them? What are the challenges in dealing with them? And should the Central Government pay *more* attention to this situation than before? And, in your opinion, how should this be dealt with? Thank you so much for doing this AMA, sir.

What are your views on Right to education act with respect to its  quality control and minority exemption aspect? I think this is interesting because of your relative disconnect from the whole NDA-UPA war: what is the BJD's main ideological contentions against the opposition in Orissa? Thanks for doing this AMA. I think it is a great initiative.

Who are your friends in the parliament, MPs that you enjoy having a conversation with? Thank you for doing this AMA. We, at reddit, are very excited about this AMA because you are the first politician to do an AMA on reddit.

1. Whenever someone dies in natural disaster, or accident and mishap, and gets a lot of media attention, Shri Naveen Pattanaik, announces a hefty sum for the victim or their family. This is something he does a lot. My question is, how is it justified? There are a lot of other people whose story don't get media attention and suffer a lot and get no government aid. How is it justified to spend hard working tax-payers money for some victims personally rather than building roads, street lights, water, etc that benefits the whole community? Being a resident of Orissa, I want to know.

2. What is your opinion on net neutrality? Hello sir, welcome to Reddit.

I read your paper, Dharitri. I like the cartoons very much. Please give my regards to the cartoonist. Also, please consider translating the cartoons into English and publishing them in your English paper. I bet they will be popular.

Some cartoons for my fellow Redditors:

**Old Man:** Last year, we gave you 100. How can we give you 500 this year!!

**Source:** [Dharitri](http://www.dharitri.com/) (in Odia) Thank you for this AMA sir. 

What do you think of the RTI act and the issue of political parties coming under it? AAP and LSP both voluntarily disclose sources of funds and have accepted RTI for political parties. Both issues are separate but are also linked by transparency.  Sir, congratulations on being the first elected representative from India to do AMA. Lots of respect! Sincerely wish you all the good luck. 

My question is- does being an MP interfere with your editorial responsibilities? Or vice-versa? How do you sort your time?   Sir, Namaskar!! Thank you for doing this AmA!!

1. My first question is perhaps one of my most important ones. But it needs a bit of a backstory... I divided them into points:
  *  All across the world, there are  [makerspaces, and hackerspaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace), which breed innovation in the local community. These ""spaces"" are built with one single purpose *Community participation and Building stuff!!* And they are open to everyone! Even you could visit [one of these spaces](http://www.hackerspaces.org/) and they will welcome you and allow you to build stuff with their equipments. Sometimes new and successful companies are made in those places(Makerbot, etc.). 
  * I see many ministers from Odisha telling that, the state can be a ""Manufacturing hub"" but when it comes to walking the plank, they only focus on the software aspect of things. Infosys, Wipro, etc.
  * Also, the whole mentality of people family, neighbours, shopkeepers is being more or less dismissive about those students/kids who want to build something based on their subject. And the only time they build something is if it is a competition. This drives up prices in the competitions/projects seasons and shopkeepers take full advantage of this.
   * Yes, India is the land of jugaad! And yes, we have IITs who produce entrepreneurs but *How can ministers/people expect MOST students who have little or no knowledge and experience of actually building/making things to come forward and start a manufacturing company?*  
 
 **What do you think can be done to change this thinking about MAKING/BUILDING(and move away from rote based method of learning) and encourage hackerspaces in India(and especially in our state)?**


2. As a engineering student, I see a certain lack of standards in India. One does not simply walk into a hardware store and ask""Bhai, give me Pozidrive screws with XYZ pitch"" and expect them to understand. But this is not just in hardware. Even there's a lack of Environmental standards and you might have heard about ""Car Safety Tests"" being brought in just now, only after there was a growing public anger about Road Safety. I think it's because of not including R&D in all spheres of policymaking. **Why do you think there's a certain lack of standards in India? What can be done about it?**

3. When I was a kid I could watch many cartoons and from different countries and in many languages. These days they are full of mythology and really crappy animation techniques. All due respect to Indian mythology, but why should you prevent kids from watching cartoons from different countries in their formative years. It's not  that they won't like Indian mythology in the future. Over the years, my respect for Indian mythology has grown and I believed they should be shown as cartoons. But no like this.... to drive TRPs and just for the sake of it. **What do you think about kids' cartoons being inundated with Indian mythology just for the sake of putting mythology in front of them?** 

4.  Given the state of driving abilities of people in India. **What is the state and central government doing to train drivers to drive safely? What measures can we adopt to prevent drivers from absconding after a hit-and-run case?** I read somewhere, *Driving in India is like playing a video game, except it's more stressful and when there's a 'Game Over'. It really is GAME OVER, for you.*

5. **What do you think about the current Internet speeds in India? Also what are your views on Government bans and Net Neutrality?**


I hope you answer my questions...

""And Mr. Satpathy, welcome to Reddit"" I learn everyday and I'm glad I was today introduced to a man who is a well deserving political leader motivated to serve the people he represents. I wish you the very best in all your endeavours!

I have no speficic questions for you, unfortunately. 

Please accept my congratulations for being holistic, humble and not the typical 'stereotype of a neta'. India has a lot of netas, I have a small running list of good ones and might I say with humility that you are on it and I'm likely to stalk you and your success going forward :)

Love from Bangalore. My background is Pakistani, I now proudly call Canada my home. But seeing an Indian MP engage in this way is all sorts of epic, and the frankness of this discussion is something to be admired. I hope politicians from all around the world engage more with their constituents in a variety of ways the way Mr. Satpathy has done so. And I definitely think that Pakistani politicians have a lot to learn from their Indian counterpart. Thank you for doing this. My questions.

**1)** The centre announced that the funds from the coal block allocations would go to the states. The media reported that Odisha would also be benefited. How much do you think will the auction of coal blocks in Odisha fetch?

**2)** How does your government plan to use these funds?

**3)** From a completely objective and non-political perspective, what do you think are the problems Odisha faces now?

**4)** How long do you think will it take for Odisha to rank among the top states on parameters such as HDI,literacy rate etc.?

**5)** We've seen that various states such as J&K, Chattisgarh and UP are taking steps to encourage tourism. Why doesn't your government do so too? Why do we not see any ads on Odisha? Hey /u/kumbhakaran, thumbs up for talking /u/tathagatasatpathy into doing this :) Tathagat, you're a sport! Hope you have fun with this and decide to do it again. Here goes:

What do you think about junking the use of the salutation ""Hon'ble"" when referring to MPs. Will be refreshing after 60+ years of disgusting sycophancy, don't you think?

What's your favourite rock album? Hi Sir. Thank you for doing this: it's such a great initiative. My questions are:

1. In the light of AAP sweeping polls in the recent past, and the many controversies that have started surrounding it after it came on power, what is your take on this whole AAP phenomenon? Do you think Kejriwal's view of politics is viable in today's political scenario?

and 2.What are the issues that we as a country need to focus on right now?

Thanks once again for doing this. I hope it encourages more politicians to have open discussions with their electorates.  I want to know only two things:

What internet speed do you get at your home?

Can you help India get 50Mbps average speed by 2017?

If so, please do, as fast internet means fast access to info. and lead to increase in productivity Hello, sir.
I want to ask you what your take is on the women's safety situation.
Do you think the government is doing enough to remedy the situation? 
How is the scenario in Odisha? Is the state government taking any initiatives there? It is not satisfactory in respect of supply of piped drinking water to rural villagers of Odisha. Odisha Government is not providing electricity charges and honorarium to the pump operators of the rural water supply as per recent RWSS notification. What steps you have taken being an MP to facilitate the people of Odisha to provide free piped water supply to the villagers of Odisha? How many months of the year is /u/kumbhakaran asleep? Do you have anyone else to work with you when he is asleep?
 Ok, this is officially the coolest AMA here till date. Hands down. Came here being a cynic, but there is hope in politics! Mr Satpathy, 

I have been a fan of your mother and in my opinion her sidelining by state leaders sowed the seed of downfall of Congress. What are your thoughts on that ? 

*  How do you feel the role of opposition in democracy. 

*  In Odisha there has been next to no opposition for the last decade. Is it making BJD administration complacent ?
* Navin Pattnaik Has tremendous goodwill both inside and outside state and is almost the most recognised campaigner for the party. Does the party have a backup plan in case he decides to or has to stepdown? 
 Congratulations on being one of the first states to pass the Lokayukta bill. Have you seen any noticeable improvements after the bill?

Orissa is closer to the BIMARU states in terms of economic performance. What are your short term and long term plans to transform Orissa into one of the better performing states in the country? A question.

Your party had been with the NDA for over 15 years. Then broke away before the 2009 elections. Then for some reason Naveen Patnaik was nomcomittal about NDA/UPA in the run up to 2014 elections and finally said he was disturbed by the idea of Modi as PM.

Finally Modi won anyway, and since then your party has been sending mixed signals, from the CM visiting the PM with all his MPs in tow for support last year to more recently your party blocking legislation and disrupting the Parliament.

Beyond political interests, what exactly is your goal here? [deleted] Why is your state one of the most backward in the country? 1. Do you have a research staff to write your speeches? Do all MPs have a team? How can one be a part of it?

2. Do MPs actually spend time reading and researching the bills before going to Parliament?

TIA. Why did you join politics? My questions would be a little unorthodox (for lack of a better word):

1. Are you proud to be an Indian (in the 21^st century)? If so, why? 

1. Are you a religious person? Do you believe in God? Would you describe yourself as a strictly *logical* person?

1. How would you rate Indian economy today in comparison to rest of the BRICS nations? And why?

1. Do you think more about the state, or the constituency you represent or *the Nation* as a whole? Please explain why?

1. Do you think you are a truly neutral person w.r.t your party? Do you think true neutrality exists?

1. On Mar 2^nd, 2015 - BJD sought *President's intervention* and dubbed Modi government 'anti-people', how do you explain this? What was the *overriding* need to denounce the duly elected government of India like this? Do you think attaching such *sensationalist* labels on *our* central government helps your cause?

1. Naveen Patnaik recently asked BJD MPs to **oppose** Modi government. 

 Do you really **think**, at a time, when we, as a nation, are in dire need of crucial reforms, social change and *rapid* economic development, resisting the *central government* at *every* step of the way is *conducive* for our nation?

1. If you feel discriminated against, there are various forums to take the matter up and make it known but to *dogmatically* oppose the government, is it the *most healthy* way to go about solving the problem?

1. How much would you say nepotism is *prevalent* in your party? 

1. Is there any `law` against `noise pollution` in Odisha? Speaking from my recent experience in Bhubaneshwar, the Police-officers, *even* after several noise complaints, don't take any serious action against *irresponsible* all night *public* use of Microphones and Loudspeakers which continues for consecutive nights in festive seasons. Why aren't `Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000` enforced in Odisha? What is your take on NetNeturality are you going to support it.
http://savetheinternet.in What do your fellow party members feel about this AMA? Do you think it could backfire?  Thank you for your participation.

1) Who are your favorite political cartoonists in Orissa? 

2) Does Orissa need a metro?

3) What steps have been taken to prevent oil spills like the one in 2009?

4) How are the Kosli people being helped - do you have a feeling that Orissa has only stolen from them?
 Hello sir. Orissa has been one of the biggest beneficiary of recent coal auctions how does the state plan to spend that money.  Orissa is a major beneficiary in the recent coal allocations. State share in central taxes pool has also gone up by 10%

Does your government have a plan to spend this extra money? Do you see this additional money contributing to a tangible improvement in Infrastructure or Social indicators in state? What do you do to unwind from work and stress? [deleted] Mr. Satpathy, do you have children? If yes, do they study in government schools or private ones?

What about the children of other politicians'/ministers' children?

PS: I'm from Bihar, and every minister's child studies in some posh school or the other. What's your opinion on Section 153A & 295A of IPC, 144 of CrPC and 66A of IT Act? All of them killing our freedoms. Pardon me but I have another question. I'm a BJP supporter but I've always had admiration for Naveen Patnaik. I appreciate that rather than jumping the secular/communal bandwagon based on how many seats the BJP has(like other parties) he has remained equidistant to both BJP and Congress and even kept out of initiatives like the Janata Parivar's caste based alliance.

Do you think Naveen Patnaik would be a good PM. Has he ever expressed such ambitions to your knowledge? Sir what's your stand on crypto-currency? I have heard you mentioning bitcoin but it was not clear whether you support or oppose it.  Thanks for doing Mr.Satpathy! I already enjoyed reading all your responses. Can you share with us a couple of stories? Your biggest achievement since you got elected, however big or small that is.And your biggest disappointment in political career.Finally, what do you think we need to do to get rid of the inertia in politics and elect individuals who are more interested in dialogue with the citizens, like you seem to be! Hi sir,
You told that you are happy that  after 9 and a 1/2 years Vedanta and posco could not acquire land as our chief minister's eye on ground and heart with the people. and again you are not anti development. Then how do you think that we can use our minerals and get benefited from it ? Dear Mr Satpathy , 

Firstly i must congratulate you for taking this bold step. It is a much needed change in the mindset of politicians. 

Now coming to my questions : 

1- As an industrialist my self , i get a strong feeling that the policies and the policy makers simply do not want the Primary revenue generating industries of Orissa i.e. Steel , Mining , Power etc to grow. The same can be seen in the current position of all these industries where they are just merely surviving to live another day. What do you have to say about the anti indutry sentiments in the state ? 

2- The Orissa Govt. has big plans for infrastructural growth (Roads, Rural Electrification, water supplies, providing huge subsidies etc.) , now all the plans are welcomed by the citizens of Orissa. My only concern is how do you plan to fund all these schemes when the major revenue generating industries have been forced to shut down  and your tax collections in the form of Sales Tax , Royalties etc have hit an all time low?

3- And lastly , when will the great leaders at Bhubaneshwar realise that all the projects have to be equally distributed all over Orissa for a fair growth of the state and it is not just Bhubaneshwar City that needs all the Medical Colleges / Road Projects / Engineering Colleges / Airports / State of the Art Bus Stands etc to name a few. 

(I hope while answering you'll truly reflect and come out with an extensive plan to elevate the poor living standard of Odisha.)          Hello, /u/tathagatasatpathy[1]  . India already produces a lot of food to sustain the population and also export at the same time. Our problem is storage and distribution. Steel or concrete grain silos are probably the best and easiest way to store grains until distribution, gunny sacks promote moisture, which in turn attracts fungi and bacteria which spoils the grains or rodents which finish off the grains.

Grain silos are such an simple answer to a huge problem the Govt. is facing in terms of storage, yet why hasn't there been any initiative to switch from gunny bags? Thank you mr Tathagata Satpathy, for doing this ama, I wanted to ask other than the lamp fellowship,is there anyway a pleb or a noob can get an oppurtunity to  intern under a MP, the lamp fellowship is a  good program but are there any short term internships that MP can provide?








Also do you watch house of cards, how murky is our system



edit:


also 1 more question, your views on subramanium swamy? any plans to make orissa into some kind of hub aiming to make life of orissa better? Thanks for the AMA, Sir.

What are your views for bringing political parties under RTI ? 1-Are you in favour of banning things like beef or porn?

2-Do you think Porn must be legalized? yes/no?why?

3-What is your opinion on caste based reservation? Should it be removed yes/no? why?

4-Will you support UCC?

5-What is your opinion on LGBT rights?

6-Do you think that AYUSH must be banned till they go under same scrutiny as Evidence based medicine undergoes?

7- How much are you in favour of keeping religion separate from state(govt)?

8-Free speech. Do you think that right to offend must come in free speech clause?
 Evening Mr. Satpathy, 

I hope you will understand that this is a place with polarizing political views. And things will go to the boiling point very quickly. People bitch about other parties all the time and you won't be an exception. In that vein, let's get started. Shall we?

1) Land ordinance - I watched your speech. Nice; perhaps you should try to assert yourself more in critical junctures. Anyway, in this subreddit, there is a feeling that *oh 4x compensation, farmers should accept, industrialization is the only mean to get India out of poverty and all*. I don't fully subscribe with this view. Industrialization is very important, if 19 million boys and girls enter the labour force every year, you - as policymakers - should and must try to provide jobs. 

**Can you please explain to the urban folks like us why this land ordinance is one of the gravest pieces of legislatures ever?** In your speech you said about entities - not enterprises - getting land. If I draw a hyperbole, I fear that Mukesh Ambani will create an one man subsidiary and get the land. You also touched the point of SIA or Social Impact Assessment. What about that? You didn't touch the point of entities not needing to give back the land after 5 years, as that was present in earlier land bill. 

2) Now that I and you despise this land ordinance, but at the same time, want jobs to grow and economy to grow - not by fueled by IMF money - what other modes of industrialization do we have? I would want to draw your attention here - http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2z3qkx/r_adani_might_be_the_worst_company_ever/cpfgd82

Assuming that poster is not a blind Modi fan - hell think that that poster is someone you work with -  how you would dissuade his fear?

3) A good number of participants here live in gated communities, read Times of India and argue in Internet. As P. Sainath had said in one of his lectures - 'what kind of society we are building?' - reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q6m5NgrCJs

What can we do to help create a more equitable society?

4) On a longer note, do you think media will be Murdocized and Indian media would be Ambanized - as the great Vinod Mehta described? Why the hell, you guys are not pushing for the bill that prevents cross ownership of media? You are even a reporter - thoughts?

5)  Why don't you push for a legislation that prevents the bullshit, fairness cream advertisements which have no scientific backing and causes gullible Indians to fall into the 'fair complexion' trap? 

6) Please push for an amendment of the IT act. If you push that, you will be a hall of fame hero in this area of Internet. 

7) Lots of other questions. But kya apke toothpaste ke namak hain? Aur kya apka masudo pe dard hain?

Sorry I had to ask all those :) Stay good Sir, stay good.  Hello Sir, Kemiti Achhanti?

a. Why does the parliament keeps increasing MPs salary by voting for themselves. There is never an opposition to these bills unlike Janlokpal or womens reservation bill. Do you think its justified?

b. How is the quality of those super duper ultra cheap samosas in the parliament canteen?

c. Isn't supporting Naveen Patnaik after Biju Patnaik just another dynastic political scenario?   
  
Today Naveen Patnaik may be one of the better CMs around, but back when Biju Patnaik's successor was being searched for, and Naveen was a novice, what political qualifications were considered to establish that Naveen was the right person for the job?

Thank you in advance!
 Hello sir, thanks a lot for doing this AMA.

I'd like to know your opinion about perks offered to the members of parliament. I looked at a few online sources and found out that Indian MPs enjoy many allowances and perks, some of them are-

> - Daily allowance of Rs. 2,000 for attending parliament.

> - Nearly 50,000 units of free electricity every year.

> - Three phone line with 170,000 free local calls every year.

> - Free business class air tickets for official tour + travelling allowance depending upon the country visited.

> - Complete maintenance of MP's resident is done by government.

All those different perks and allowances add up to a total of nearly **35 lakhs**. Do you think it is justified to offer so many perks and allowances to MPs while most of the country still suffers from poverty? Don't you think some of the allowances should be reconsidered and brought down to a realistic amount? Or at least there should be a government body which ensures that these funds are actually used to serve people and not for personal use? What are your views on 3-D printing tech (reprap 3-D printers), Raspberry Pi and other open technologies?

Don't you think it would be amazing if our kids learn these technologies from the very beginning?

How many MPs are aware of the amazing implications of these technologies and are doing something to promote them? Why aren't we embracing more open tech in our schools/government instead of signing huge contracts with Microsoft? This is  the best AMA yet,  thankyou mods Hello sir, it is good to see someone take such an initiative!
How is your relationship with Naveen Patnaik? 
Is he a good leader according to your political sensibilities? Thank you for the AMA sir, I read about your reply in 2006 on reservation system of backward classes and must say it was really a great opinion raising some very valid points.
What are your views about the Land acquisition act? Which is your favorite book and which are you reading now? Sir, it is a well known fact that a state that gets a good representation in the national cabinet (key ministerial posts, etc) gets more incentives. Now given that your party once had an alliance with BJP at state level, and now that BJP is in power at the centre, would it have been better if BJD had joined NDA so as to improve the conditions of Odisha? (I want to cite a comment made by a forum memeber here regarding Odisha being the ""Andaman of mainland""). 

Thank you. Mr Sathpathy,

Thank you for doing this AMA. 

1. Can you tell us what plans and suggestions you endorse for creating jobs in odisha and nationwide ?

2. Since your party is primarily a regional one, can you tell us why people from other regions should bother about it ?

3. What do you feel are the top 5 issues which are amenable to government/political intervention ? i.e. What do you feel the top priorities should be ?

4. What are the best avenues you recommend for reducing corruption and increasing probity and transparency in public life ? How best to increase realistic idealism ?

 Sir
I know you fought against reservations.
Q1: What are doing further fighting against the bill
Q2: Do you think reservations are relevant today. If yes or no why?
Q3: Even if you are for the reservation or against it, it has to be removed eventually. How do you propose to do that and most important does anyone in indian politics have courage enough to do it
Thanks The views of children (defined as citizens below the age of 18) are not adequately represented in our present form of government. Nor are they allowed to participate as much as would have been practically possible. I myself (17yo) have felt left out a lot of times in the past few years. I wish to help the world around me, and start early too. But I am unable to do that. 

What are your views on this, and would you like to do something for this problem? If so, how?

What is your opinion on lowering the age of majority?

I appreciate it that you've taken time out of your schedule to answer our questions today. Thank you! The Law Commission submitted its latest report a couple of days ago & one of its major recommendations was an audit of the accounts of political parties by CAG mandated auditors. What is your party's stand on greater transparency in political funding?  Sir
there are further Q's
1. As someone said there is natural wealth in Odisha which has not yet been utilized.
2. There is tremendous scope for tourism (like Goa Kerala Maharashtra MP etc) which has not been utilised.
3. Why are people in odisha so uneducated.
4. Tsunamis are frequent. Why not go for one time solution like wave breakers and mangroves. which is easily achieved and save crores of property every year.
5. Why CRZ regulations are flauted in Odisha
6. There are several redevelopment projects proposed by BDA, why not for other areas of Odisha
7. There is a lot of scope to develop the economy of Odisha, what is hampering it Which politician do you admire the most? Hello sir. I first want to congratulate your government on passing the [Anti-Witchhunt Law](http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/odisha-assembly-passes-anti-witch-hunting-bill-113120501161_1.html). It took a lot of legal battles from my fellow rationalists in Odisha to draw the attention to the issue.

Second, I believe that Odia people are a very peaceful people, who believe in live and let live. There are not many religious fundamentalist movements in the state. I was disappointed to see the rises in attacks on Valentine's Day in [Bhubaneswar](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/moral-policing-mars-valentine-s-day-celebrations-in-odisha-115021401058_1.html) and smaller cities like Rourkela. Please, check these fundamentalists. They tarnish a region's image and discourage investors.

Thirdly, what is your take on the [IIM site issue](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-odisha-state-government-recommends-iim-at-sambalpur-2065535)? I think Bhubaneswar is only site that is fulfilling that criteria set by the Centre. The state BJP is intentionally raking up the issue. They don't actually have the people's interest in mind. Although, if centre makes the requirement lower, I think the IIM should be allowed in western Odisha. Bhubaneswar already has 30+ colleges and IIT, IIIT, AIIMS etc. Sir, do you think we can ever completely rid our government of corruption?  What is your opinion on the use of Eminent Domain? I think it should be used for roads, highways, railways, ports. And even there, only where it's the only option available. I am absolutely against use of Eminent Domain for factories, industries, schools and what not. What is your opinion?  

I enjoyed watching your speech on the mining bill.

 Hello Mr. Sathpathy, I am sorry I am not quite aware of your party's views on the recent land acquisition bill. 

A related question would be, a lot of villagers and tribals have been protesting against the BJD government backed land acquisition
by POSCO for quite some time now. How do you plan to arrive at a quick solution without compromising these villagers' daily livelihood? What actions are needed in Orissa to meet the growing demand for specialised skills which will be required by industries in coming years?

Does the govt have any programme in place? Does it need any support in terms of expertise in manufacturing automation.  Who has been your ideal? Did it change over time since childhood?

And let it be an honest answer, and not a ""nice sounding answer"" that make you look better (Everyone knows what that answer is, the great you_know_who). 

Speaking for myself, I'd much rather accept an unexpected answer than the typical and dishonest answer. 



 How do you deal with working within a party structure? 

There are elements within every political party that are not entirely clean. However in India, politicians rarely speak out against fellow party-members or assert an individual agenda in terms of legislation. So this raises a natural question about a politician's integrity i.e. even if you are personally clean yourself, keeping quiet about certain corrupt elements/adopting stands against personal beliefs for the good of the party creates an obvious contradiction. Do you grapple with such questions? Or do you think it is not a concern at all and everyone you know in your party is honest and doing a good job? Hello Mr. Satpathy,

   1. Don't You think the media today has become very biased with most of the press and news channels being overtly or covertly associated with political parties and them acting as mouthpieces, more so in the case of press? What do you think can be made to make the media and press more unbiased and accountable?

 2. There have been observations of the quality of discussions in the Parliament deteriorating over the last few years, what in your opinion needs to be done to make them more fruitful?

  3. With so many disruptions in both the houses, don't you think this will give the government all the more reason to promulgate ordinances there by subverting the Parliament? 

  4. How do you think the MPs disrupting the houses can be made accountable for the disruptions? 

  5. Shouldn't there be a guideline on the minimum amount of time for discussions and debates with a provision to extend the sessions in case of loss of hours to adjournment. What's your take on ministers with pending criminal cases not allowed to contest elections?  Sir i would like to know what is your take on India's international policies. How is the internal democracy in the BJD? How are the voices of dissent addressed? I had visited Orissa years ago, as a tourist, and loved it. Living in metro India we often forget how beautiful the people outside the big cities are. Konark & Puri were a truly memorable experience. I love your state and its food (some of the best prawns I've ever had)

I think people of Orissa don't get their due in the national dialogue which is driven by Delhi / Maha / UP / Bihar / Bengal / TN / Punjab. 

The current government seems to be making a deeper push for federalism. What are your thoughts on this? Hi, this has been one great AMA.On a tangent your name is unique, tathagata is generally a mahayana buddhist name for enlightened fellow in 'suchness', any story regarding how you got this name? You are one cool ass politician Sir, you being a journalist yourself, what is your opinion on freedom of speech in the country, especially on the internet (with respect to Section 66A of the Information Technology Act)? What do you think about internet censorship and spying. Do we have an NSA equivalent here in India. I will be very suprised if our government is not collecting data of its citizens, considering Modi and Shah ji are not some kind of monks to stay away from these dirty tricks to have power grabs. What is your take on the impact of [Dharma Port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhamra_Port) construction which would impact one of the largest breeding grounds  of [Olive Ridley turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_ridley_sea_turtle#Nesting_grounds) ?
I understand that infrastructure development is an important aspect for a developing nation, but does it have to come at a price of destroying/ risking creatures that don't have a vote of their own ?
Or does a creature need to be majestic like the Indian tiger to get any attention/ sympathy from the masses ? OK. Any way who is this /u/kumbhakaran ?

http://www.reddit.com/u/kumbhakaran Hi, just wanted to know why its so difficult to make pothole free roads. Shri Tathagata any chance Bhubaneswar will get a high speed internet service that actually is broadband and really works availability and presence wise?

Thanks for your time. Dear Sir, 

I am a fan of your speeches in Parl. Your body language and choice of words are representative of the young and aware Indian generation and this coupled with you grey hair is a lethal combination which can yield thorough results. Although I comment superficially here, I would like to know your views on the nexus between mafia in general and politicians. Do you think the absence of multi party politics having first past the post electoral system will lead to the receding of mafia waves in this country? Do you think having a two party system is feasible in India and will drastically limit the scope of corruption in at least the higher echelons if not at the grassroot level? How and till when we might achieve this? Whats the state of private lobbying in India ? Do you support legislation to curb this cancer ? I appreciate you initiation. Hopefully, we see more politicians coming here and connecting directly with people. This instills a trust in you and BJD. 
Cheers Please request Jay Panda to do an AMA.  Which has more impact on Indian democracy money or religion (caste,) Do you think media in India projecting negative image of India? _/\_Hello  Tathagata Sir _/\_ /u/tathagatasatpathy can U post d link of video 2006 which u talked about
 N.B-For a pudding of the proof, please watch the 2006 video
AND hat-off 2 all ur  well-thought responses  (@_@)
 the first politician(4m ODISHA) to hold an AMA ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. What do you think the main reason for Odisha not producing national level leaders like it used to?. We had Harekrushna Mahtab, Biju Pattnaik who had their place in national politics,but now-a-days we don't find Politicians like them. What problems do you think is easily solvable but still nobody gives a shit?!? aaaaand why cant you try to solve them one by one (with with some help ofc)  Peace !!  Hi sir,
Your party always tells about step motherly behaviour of Central govt. what about your same steps towards other district of your state like kalahandi.
 Hi sir,
I watched your recently uploaded video which contained very meaningful points.
And my point here is like the way central govt is inviting all including nris to invest in India in make in India project.
Same way they or any state govt should invite people to invest in agriculter and they should allow leasing of agricultural land to them.as far as my knowledge Orrisa allow leasing of agricultural land by only some specific categories such as defense personnel or widows. If you can include nri also, then we can invest. Hello! What do you think about ban on India's daughter documentary? 

Edit: what do you think are the greatest challenges for Orissa in the next couple of decades?  Hello sir,

1) What do you like about the present central government?

   2) What do you think about the devolution of powers to the states that is currently happening  (through NITI ayog and various other means)

 3) What do you dislike about the present central government? What is Orissa government doing to fight corruption? Thank you Mr. Satpathy for doing this AMA,nice to see an Odia MP on R/India

Q1.) Will it be wrong to call you a political opportunist given the fact that the two of your Newspapers never play an active role in reporting the involvement of state govt. in the Chit fund scams?


Q2.)If you are the chief whip of BJD in LS,what is the BJD stance on Koshal State formation.(Also give us your personal opinion on the matter)?


Q3.) When will your paper be called ""ODISHA Post"" from the existing ""Orissa post"" :/


The state has changed its name,please to do the needful.
  your views on 5saalkejriwal? Mr. Satpathy, this is for you. Will you fight 100 duck size gau maata ji or 1 gau mata ji size duck? Please answer. This is a very important question given that Gau Mata ji is a very sacred animal and females are disposable. Thanks! 1. On a scale of 1 to 10, if Congis are the most 'secular' at 10, where does BJD stand? 

2. Also, your personal views on secularism as held and practiced by the Congis. Hi Sir.

What's your idea on to tackle the rising number of rapes from your state? Edited.",AMA,2015-03-15 20:30:44

Was it the eventual shut-down of r/TheDonald? Was it on the news somewhere? Summer vacations? My guess would be the AMAs we've had recently. They have been popularized and advertised on the person's twitter handle and in turn have attracted people to reddit.  Modi sock puppet/s!

Please thank /u/Kunalb11 (Kunal Shah, founder of Freecharge) and /u/wordswithmagic for setting up this AMA.",r_india_mod," Can we please put the pitchforks aside and actually ask straightforward tough questions? This is the need of the hour. The world would be watching this.  Can we please go with some alternatives as a community so it helps drive home the point? It was wrong for FB to call this program 'Internet', its not Internet. It was wrong that they said 'some internet is better than no internet'. It was wrong that it was exclusive for 'signed up' participants only. We got past that already. Its not about NetNeutrality anymore. 


1. Assuming the platform is open to all, Zero rating in principle is not wrong. What we allow to be zero rated is what matters. We can have support forums, dev communities, documentation/help/faqs and such pages zero rated. Not the main marketing site of the product or the core business website. For a SaaS, its easy to make that call, all logged in pages goes off the zero-rating. For a hosted/in-premises technology solution, it means marketing website is off zero-rating. Facebook's main website will never make that cut. Whatsapp will never make that cut. So does wikipedia. Govt services that are informational will be allowed but service based ones will NOT be allowed.

2. Second option for FB to get the next billion users online is to buy raw bandwidth for them so they can waste/use it any which way they please. They can target specific parts of India, like rural areas and be benevolent about it. Lets not try to fool people with 'it is expensive'. People who have dealt with ISPs for bandwidth know exactly what they mean. 


Going with one-track-mind of 'all zero rating is wrong or bad' OR its against NeutralNet will not help us get faster to Internet for all - with the right price attached.  Dear Mr. Daniels, I've highlighted my questions below *in italics*. 

**Question 1:** *How much money has been put into marketing your internet.org platform?* In-app notifications, polls, windows and sponsored FB posts count as marketing. *How much of it was dedicated to the actual product development?* If Facebook stands to make no profit from this venture, why has the company made the said investment in marketing and development? 

**Question 2:** If (big if) the motive was 100% charity, *what other ways were considered as worthy of charity?* Example: Microsoft's former CEO launched the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation to deal with issues in the developing world. Why would Zuck and other stakeholders not just do the same? Do you really think a farmer in Maharashtra can benefit more from joining Facebook groups than having access to high-yielding crop, equipment, and infrastructure? 

**Question 3:** *What are your plans for making sure that the next billion internet users don't fall prey to the same mistakes that the first billion did?* Are there landing pages dedicated to educating them against common internet frauds and time-wasters? What's to say that they won't just end up sending a bunch of frandsheep requests to women and killing each other over online arguments? We both know that's happened many times in the past, and the fact that you're planning to introduce a largely un-initiated audience to this platform greatly increases such risks. *By how much has Facebook beefed up its moderation team to deal with foreseeable cases of severe online harassment?*

**Question 4:** Please take a few minutes to [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAQWsTFF0BM) and respond to concerns raised therein. Looking forward to *your side of the story on why VOIP was omitted*. Please feel free to *respond to other critical points* mentioned in that video too.


**Feedback:** Your marketing for internet.org has been atrocious. Calling people who do not subscribe to your world view 'lobbyists' is akin to vilifying everyone who disagrees with you. That's how children argue! The whole over-aggressive, dare I say immature, marketing push has raised more eyebrows than eyeballs. 

I appreciate your attention. Please take the time to do an AMA for more than an hour. This is a complicated and critical conversation, arbitrary limitations on communication will harm both our POVs. After all, having more and better communication is the point of the Internet (.org or otherwise). 

I look forward to an extended, insightful conversation with you and the Reddit India community.

Thanks again! Is there any mechanism by which the mods can restrict this AMA to only those members whose handles are at least a week old? Knowing Facebook and the crap they pull, they are not above brigading the thread. Maybe we should ""accidentally"" call some international net neutrality activists in this AMA? Oh boy. Dayum! Now thats unexpected. Throwing himself (and his PR team) into randians' natural environment.... They've got courage at the very least. :/ May I bring my gandassa please?  This is a huge one. We all need to ask the right questions, and not indulge in shitpostery. Expecting new accounts to pop out of nowhere for the AMA. Won't be surprised if most questions go unanswered Time to post some serious tough questions. If they are able to get this AMA right (even by applying sneaky tactics, like creating fake accounts and posting questions themselves), this would be big news, and they will go all their way to declare how Free Basics was challenged but it stood its way by not opposing Net Neutrality. This must not happen.

Get ready Randians, this is our chance to question the wrong, and prove the people that we can produce more than just dank memes.

Divyashakti aapke sath rahe. A lot of questions have already been posited; and it seems Facebook has some form of prepared response for all these questions.

I think there is a way to clear up the confusion. If I could post my question on this AMA, this is what I would ask - ""*Would Facebook let the users decide what count as Free Basics?*""

They could have gone with 1 month of open free internet for everyone, then the users would have to pick, say, 40 apps that they can access for free from that point on.

This helps connect people too, without letting Facebook gain much from it. That is, if connecting people is their only motto. Is fb letting users to define and customize the websites/platforms included in free basics?
What shuld be included in free basics should be chosen by users not facebook. If fb decides what are free basics then its not ‪#‎freebasics‬, its ‪#‎freeBusiness‬! 
 >Chris has a BSE in Mechanical Engineering from Duke University and an MBA from Duke University - The Fuqua School of Business. 

Chris, heads up. Most comments on Randia are going to sound like the name of your business school. Merry Christmas.  only 1 hour? at least make it 2 pls, it's weekend. Prepare your questions. Holy shit. This is going to be epic. I just hope he goes beyond the usual rehearsed PR response and gives some real answers. Don't downvote me for this, but one of the points 'Free Basics' claims in the newspaper ad is that anybody can join the app and there are over 800 developers who have joined their program already because of this. This takes the tooth out of the claim that Free Basics is hurting new startups from sprouting up. And I am sure, this is the line Chris Daniels is going to use tomorrow to support net neutrality & Free Basics.

What's the truth behind this claim from Facebook? Can someone answer this? 

 > The Fuqua School of Business

Thought you were trolling there for a minute Thanks /u/kunal and /u/wordswithmagic Suggested questions. Excuse overlaps with others.

1. Why not come clean with your business plan re Free Basics? No one begrudges anyone making money. Making fools, is another matter.
2. If your platform really is open to all, then why is it that only Reliance that has signed up so far? What's cooking?
3. Who is @MikeAtFacebook and why should we take an anonymous person claiming to be a VP of some sort on Twitter seriously? Why should we even entertain him? Is he a policy guy?
4. What do you think would have been the fate of Facebook had there been a Free Basics sort of thing going at the time. Elaborate with hypothesis.
5. Lastly, why is the entire Free Basics campaign so patronising? Be careful people! Facebook is bound to pull some shady shit, including vote manipulation. Genuinely curious to know his response here.   Whoaaa, okay I've set a reminder. This is epic!  This is really good, everyone will be able to get a look at both sides of the argument which will help them make an informed decision.  You say there won't be any ads  and that it would be available for free for any developers. I find it extremely hard to believe this would continue forever.
You have every right to  later change your policy, put ads on free basic websites, and pull out your competitors from free basic.
As, simple as that!

Open internet is crucial, specially for a developing economy like India. 
 FUCK YES!! THANK YOU!!! 

This was desperately needed.  [Those looking to understand the Net Neutrality concerns around Free Basics can look at this post and ask questions from it.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3l9y7t/net_neutrality_supporters_are_not_depriving_the/)  Why not collaborate with Google which is a leader in this sector? Hi Chris, please answer any or as many you can.

Do you feel Facebook is misusing it's position by all the advertisements and putting links in people's notifications for supporting their own cause? If an independent company who pays for ads on Facebook wants to do the same, would it allow that? If No - Why doesn't Facebook hold itself to the same standards? If Yes - Really? You'd allow organisations to put notifications in our stream for ad revenue?

Do you think if Facebook was launched in a world with MySpace offering zero rating, would Facebook be as successful as it is today?

What's your opinion on writing government policy which allows zero rating from different providers? Do you see the Internet as we know being segregated into different network groups for the next 1 billion people you want to connect, is this how you envision the future? so is this going to held in /r/india or /r/IAmA  ? Bet he is going to pick and choose questions and give 'pre-approved' answers. Throw in some senti stuff life Digital India, job and education opportunity for next billion and the likes. BC who is downvoting this? Hey Reddit community!  Thanks for having me, and for participating during what for many is a holiday weekend.  This is the first AMA I’ve done, so bear with me a bit.  At Facebook, we have a saying that feedback is a gift, and Free Basics has been on the receiving end of many gifts this year. :)  We’ve made a bunch of changes to the program to do our best to earnestly address the feedback, but we haven't communicated everything we’ve done well so a lot of misconceptions are still out there.  I’m thankful for the opportunity to be able to answer questions and am happy to keep the dialogue going. This is going to be interesting! I'm pretty skeptic on how this will turn out to be. http://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1.gifv [removed] Guys I know we love logic and mature reasoning in randia, but please be mindful of the fact that logic and reason is not what Facebook is using to promote this. They're simply saying its awesome and it will solve a billion people's problems. So can we also just fucking bully them out of here?

So, is it his what FREE BASICS is about? I already knew Something's really fishy on its Name; Now I came to know ! What's the reply you have for this !!! Instead of making websites modify their pages to make them light, submit it and agree to FB's terms of use, why doesn't FB use code to modify any webpage that a user requests to make it light? This will be truly Internet for the poor, right? If connecting and educating people is the main moto of Internet.org, why don't it provides free access to online courseware such as Mit's ocw, edX, coursera?  I wouldn't be participating in this AMA if I was using Free Basics. Just saying. How can the people of India trust internet.org as an open platform? If a facebook competitor wants to use the same services can it? If yes how can we trust you given the fact that Facebook do not allow posting links to tsu.co a social media networking site that pays users for posting content. I have strong gut feeling that this guy is going to be nailed hard, very hard! [removed] Bruce Willis is going to be doing an AMA? Cool!

Here is the verification if you need it: https://twitter.com/redditindia/status/569747921396244480

Besides my work as an actor, TV host & singer (and an ex-Dentist), I am into adventure & a whole lot of traveling. Sky diving, quad bike racing, shark cage diving are some of the activities I have indulged in in the past (apart from the gamut of new ""stunts"" I had to perform on my show recently). There is still so much to do & achieve in this lifetime. 

I love my food & those who cook for me. I am a closet cartoonist and an avid reader in my leisure hours. And now that we've made this acquaintance....

AMA!

ALL RIGHT GUYS! THIS WAS FUN!

I don't mean to scream with the Caps Lock but I gotta go now. Kaam-shaam bhi karna hai (that's what they all say).

And hope we all emerge unscathed ;)
 [deleted] How would you describe the extent of racism in India?
 hi chang, good to see u have an all round interest.. how do u deal with people calling u chinky when actually u r sau pratishat shudh desi? do u feel insulted or do u ignore or do u smile and correct the person who name called u? [deleted] ALL RIGHT GUYS! THIS WAS FUN!

Thank you for the questions, specially because most of them were not the same, old ones. Love & Luck and may the Almighty bless us all. Ciao! [deleted] Hi Chang! Which has been your favourite reality show so far?

 What was the toughest stunt you did on Khatron Ke Khiladi? 

Assuming that the show has completed shooting by now, who won? :P

PS: Kinda surprised you haven't landed a toothpaste ad yet, lol.

PPS: Any plans for Bigg Boss?  Do you have to be a sadist to be a dentist? [deleted] Hey Man, i really liked your performance in Badmash Company. 

Just wanted to say you did a great job.

If we ever made a Indian Star Trek i would like to see you as Captain Sulu ;) Hi, what is with the title Chang and dentistry? My hometown seems to have a dentist with this name ... Oh wait... Where are you from? Dha.... are you from? Who is your favorite mortal kombat character?  Do you still keep in touch with your fellow Indian Idol contestants? What are they up to these days? Hey Chang! First of all I have been a big fan of your work from Indian Idol days, I had even kept a record of every song you sang in the competition. My favourite was ""Meri saanson main basa hain tera hi ek naam"". The question that i had was, you have a couple of singles out, so when are you planning on a complete album and secondly are there any plans of solo gigs and concerts?  Does Aditya Chopra exist? People say he is a myth. 
Have you traced your roots back in China?  Do you like shocking people with your Hindi?

I am sure lot of people would have been amazed over your command on the hindi language.   Sorry to sound like an annoying aunt but,

Shaadi kab kar rahe ho bhaiya? Do you miss that non celeb life ? ;) [deleted] What do I do for my bad breath ? Do people simply consider you to be someone from NE? Or has anyone asked you if you are from China?


What project/s are you working on now? [deleted] Ass or tits?  Kya aapke toothpaste mein namak hain?  Hi Chang! Thank you for doing this AMA


I have a very simple question : do you like video games? If so what are your favourites?  [deleted] How much scripted is Indian Idol? Can't help but ask - are you bisexual? How was it working with  Chris  Gayle ?  

Also what do you think about casting couch ? Have you been asked to sleep with someone to land a project  for yourself ?

Hope you don't  find my question crude,  that's how I  structure  my  sentence ! 

Thank you and good luck [deleted] What are your favorite books? 

And can we have a look at some of your own cartoons. 

Thanks. [deleted] How many languages do you know ? And you are cool bro ! Hi Chang, 

Despite a performance in Badmash Company that was appreciated, why is that you have not appeared in more films after that? How do you explain the 5 year gap between Badmash Company and Byomkesh Bakshy? 

Have you shied away from playback signing or have music producers not approached you?

Given that you completed your schooling in Dehradun (my hometown) could you tell me one thing that you absolutely love about the place and the one thing that you hate?

And given your love of adventure sports, did you try rifer rafting in Rishikesh?  which gal from bollywood u find hot? [removed] do u watch the oscars? what did u think of neil patrick harris's hosting.. i personally found these oscars one of the most boring.. i luvd the ones hosted by billy crystal.. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Is there a list of banned words for television that you consider should not be on that list? How hard was it to actually get a break in the big bad world of acting post Indian Idol?
Also do you think Indian Idol is more of a popularity contest than a talent contest?
Cheers mate Hi Chang! Thanks for doing this AMA. 
What's one question you'd hoped nobody would ask you?  Hey Chang. Just stopping by to say hello.  Assuming you worked with Neeraj Kabi, how method is he being for Byomkesh Bakshy? :P Thanks for doing this!

What kind of cinema do you aspire to be in?

Would you be open to doing a small indie feature? Or would you rather work with big producers in commercial films? Have you ever traced your lineage to find out when you guys came over from China and what prompted the move? Any luck in finding your first crush? That was a mushy post in your blog but i liked it.


Suggest a decent tooth-pest for daily use. I use sensodyne. Far better AMA than the ones by filmi types Hi Chang, nice  to see you doing an AMA. My sisters used to watch the Indian Idol and they were your fans. They thought it was cute to watch a North-east  guy sing Hindi songs flawlessly. But I felt its unfair for the rest of the Northeast, because only the ones who speak/sing in Hindi have the chance to come to national television. What are your thoughts? Chang bhai u like indo Chinese food or Chinese Chinese... 😂 😂  [removed] SAAAAAAR THNKU 4 AMA! DO YOU VIST /r/BAKCHODI???????

What do you regret about your college life? Or just life? Are you as patriotic as Zing from Badmaash Company ? Okay I m really enjoying this, the way you are answering everyone's questions ,must appreciate 😊 Hi chang, good to see you here., only one question.. how was your life before indian idol and after indian idol.

All the best for your new movie and thank you for the AMA.., Ah, was too late for the AMA :( But will enjoy reading the responses! Nice ! Multi tasking guy :) Hi Chang! Excited to hear you're featuring in the upcoming Byomkesh Bakshy movie. I hope you've a super evil role. 

What do you think? Would you prefer to play villainous characters? TIA. Hiii Chang ! If you have to choose one Singing/dancing/Acting/anchoring/writing/being a dentist ? :P Sup chang chang how do u rate the different reality shows these days from the good old indian idol days.. do these shows really help the careers of the participants / winners? >I am a closet cartoonist

Ooh, tell us more, favourite cartoonist?


And what do you think about the current state of Indian animation?  Let's get to the tough questions.

Faced any off-hand, uneasy comments while growing up? Kids can be cruel, you know. It's a much easy, globalized world now, but things would be different a decade or two ago? [deleted] Do you play any musical instruments? How did you develop interest in music?

EDIT: Also, the Chinese New Year which began last week is being celebrated. Do you celebrate it in India? If so, how? Hey man! Saw KKK for the first time last week, loved it. Then noticed you were in it too. Have fun!

Questions: We often hear about attacks on folks from North-East/Asian features & all sorts of discrimination. What's the worst you've faced? Any discrimination within the industry? What do you have to say about singers turning actors in Bollywood? Is it safe to assume that even though someone doesn't have that acting calibre but only because he/ she is famous, should torture audiences by making movies.
PS: My whole point is towards likes of Himesh. I like your acting! In what movie we will see you next? As a singer or an actor?  Hello Mei, I liked your work in that zombie movie Go Goa Gone.. If you were offered a role as lead actor and you had to choose the lead actress, which INDIAN actress would you choose? What came first? Chicken or egg? Dammit! Missed the AMA! Just wanted to say you're a good singer. which cast do you belong to? (kaun gotra se ho bhayya?)  SAAAAAAR THNKU 4 AMA! DO YOU VIST /r/BAKCHODI ???????
 I don't see my questions being posted here err..!  And I have no more queries , cuz most of them are already answered ;) just wanted to say you are one of the finest guys I've known , hoping I get to meet you someday :* Man, i wish i was chinese indian. Would have helped to have understood my ex-girlfriend when she was angry :-)
 Been your fan since the day I saw you on Indian Idol auditions ! Just knew you'll make it big :D Also Chang! I am a web developer by profession and would like to build you a website, if you don't mind. Don't worry it will be for free :) And you are going quite well on KKK , tbh was not expecting you to be on this Show ;)  A'ite Mr. Chang so this is something that I've been meaning to ask. Being Indian of Chinese descent, what sort of women do you find attractive?  Don't give me the generic answer - because I am Indian and I have some broad tastes ... and I've seen and learned that the culture in which you grow up influences that taste.

Thanks. Once upon a time I respected you.. ",AMA,2015-02-24 18:16:36

*From op's github repo:*

What does 10k sample mean? Did he manually solve all the captchas and recorded them as training data? Or it means something else?

I have a good grip in R and R studio( i dunno it will help of not)  So, FUP of my ISP was broken for the last 5 months and I've been enjoying 10 mbps true unlimited. They fixed it yesterday and my speed is back to 1 mbps, post FUP (60GB is the FUP and I'm already at 270GB).  It feels like my life has went to hell, my heart can't handle this. I don't know if this qualifies for this thread, anyways.   Say I have to implement a software timer interrupt, how would the interrupt be fired, wouldn't the process which fires an interrupt also need processor time to signal to scheduler to context switch?

Someone should have at AMA This is the kind of interview you can take when you actually take time to read through source material and do your own research instead of reading 5 newspaper headlines and speaking for hours on it. Poor guy. Unlike the AMA, he did not have the option of bypassing the tough questions by ignoring them or just saying read my book. Is it just me or has Tharoor been on a media blitz lately? He was removed as Congress spokesperson 2 years ago but I see more of him than all official Congress spokespeople put together. Damn I love this dude, No Indian media will ever have this guts to question the losers and winners like this. 

I fucking loved this. When I asked some of these same questions in the AMA 

>Hi, Shashi a pleasure to have you here and your book an era of darkness was fantastic and very educational about our past.
My questions are

>1. How can you as an educated and qualified person not actually stand up with congress nepotism? Why don't you lead the Congress party?.


>1. Why is it every congress ministers actually want Rahul Gandhi to lead the party? how come someone like you who is more experienced does nothing about the sad condition of congress?


>1. Do you think Congress can ever regain power with the party structure as of now?
Thank you.

His answer was

So I liked browsing through the questions and answers on these subreddits. It's the only place I can actually have any sort of real discussion, especially now, anonymity is crucial. > I'm new here

Please go back (atleast from r/india) otherwise you will be submerged in negativity about india and hate your existence. Digg refugee /r/pcmasterrace brought me to Reddit. Then, /r/steam and /r/unixporn From thoughtcatalog.com Erotic fiction.

They share thier AMA verification on Twitter, Things changed after that.   2015, that Messi goal against Bayern. was searching porn streaming site redtube on chrome address bar, a faulty click brought me here. :( I saw a roast thread and wanted to join in on the fun thus my username PCMR and Steam trading.

Found r/movies and watched a shit tons of good flicks. 

Thought there might be a sub for India too, came here, became way too negative to talk to any real human, so struck here for now. i stumbled upon the brilliant AMA done by Arnub Goswami where he was torn apart by the fellow redditors (atleast imo)..decided to join then & there!

Diagnosed with Blood clot in my brain and many isochemtric foci that restricts blood and oxygen flow in my brain. Already had tumour. Doctor says that if you take tension anymore (which I am taking, because of my relationships and mental health issues), you will either get a stroke or partial/full memory loss.

Dont know how much time is left, as I have completely lost it - faith, believe system and hope and most importantly my comprehension ability.

I have done pretty good in my life till now and was one of the 1.5 lpm guy! 

Wanted to do few things before I completely dissappear - first online and then offline. Ask me anything. Roast if you want. 

EDIT: Thank you for all your questions, comments and wishes. What a great community this is. I felt so relaxed talking to each one of you. Read most of them (except some long ones) and tried answering them. I wish you all well and hope you and I both do good. See you somewhere soon. Sayonara!

Get well soon ❤️ [deleted] we're all going where you are, any last words/advice you'd like to give the to us who are slowly dying?  If you come to Delhi, meet me please! I'd love to have a cup of coffee and try to understand how you are dealing with this. My problems are nothing compared to yours.  Rula diya bhai. 

Wishing you the best. 😘

Do update us when you have  conquered all this, which you are definitely going to do! 

Good luck. 
 Hugs. I am so sorry!

What were some best moments in your life?

Also, when was your first diagnosis?  bro , knowing when you will die is a gift which not many will have in their life. So make amends and don't forget to live RIGHT NOW. This reminds me of munnabhai mbbs movie actor jimmy shergil.

Anyway. Stay strong. Have fun. Sorry to break it to you but it's 1.6 lpm, not 1.5 lpm. hi, i hope you have people around you to help you deal with all the bad stuff,

I keep joking around about how i wanna kill myself, posts like these open up my eyes to how surreal death would actually be.

dont really have a question specifically, but if something, what has been the best advise someone ever gave u?

you have my best wishes Hang in there tight buddy! All the best.

* Do you have a bucket list?

* When was your disease diagnosed?

* What happened to your relationship? (Sorry if it is too personal; you can skip it)

* How did you diagnose it? Were there any symptoms?

* Apart from the risk of stroke and mental issues (which I suppose is because of the grim situation), does the disease debilitate your functioning?

I understand this is a tough situation, but boy you are a fighter. This very AMA is a testimony to that.. Not a lot of people can do it. This community will be here for you when you need it. 420 Blazeit.

Anyways, what do you want to do for the rest of the days. Also any regrets? Bhai, this is the time to touch as many lives as possible.


You have already said you have been called dick & arrogant, try to live peacefully & inspire folks around you with a positive outlook.


Even to have one *(additional)* person look up to you makes a lot of change. With nothing to fear, you can reach your true potential. Start distributing good memories around man. I'm so happy to read that you have no regrets. In the current juncture of my life, I'd probably die with a ton. This is inspiring me to do shit and not waste time.
&nbsp;

I hope you can beat it but if you can't then I hope it is a painless & peaceful exit. Keep fighting! When are you planning to see Avengers: Infinity war?

Stay strong bro What suggestion/advise would u give to a 17 year old? *One day we will die, snoopy*.

*True,but on all the other days we will not*.

https://in.pinterest.com/pin/208221182750317976/ What's plan of action now? Can I/we help you get any of bucket list wish fulfilled? Best of luck mate. 

What were the symptoms and how did it get diagnosed?  Ok. Knew a guy who had a brain tumor. The doc. gave him max one month to live. Not wanting to disappoint his parents, he got married against advise of all friends. It's been 10 years since. He has two kids, and still working as of this day....   


The brain not receiving oxygen is a serious issue. But I would say don't lose hope or give up easily. Ultimately, you are the best judge, however, having a positive attitude will give you the best shot at life.

Good luck. What's the main cause for this disease??

What medical test should be taken to diagnose this? Kuch Ni hoyega tujhe Don't have any questions. But just want to wish you the best. Sending you a virtual hug bro!

Get well soon :) I found this post 

This is my cousin Gareth. He lost his leg to cancer 3 years ago and now has 15 lung tumours and is terminally ill at age 26. Last week he completed the London Marathon.  [The link is at the bottom of the post]

I’m not suggesting you to go for marathons but at this time you could do things you wouldn’t dream of.

As it was mentioned in Dark Knight Rises, “How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible without the most powerful impulse of the spirit: the fear of death.”

This is your race against time. This is the right moment to challenge life.

One last thing. You run, you fly, you fall, you crash but you dare not stop up till the end of your time.

 Sigh....first of all if what you have mentioned is all true, then it's really sad that an asset like you might be leaving us in the near future. My deepest condolences. 

This world is weird in the sense that those who want to die cannot die, those who deserve to die, don't die..but those who really want to live and are willing to contribute to this world regardless of whether for themselves, for their families, their kin, or for humanity as a whole, often end up getting the short end of the stick. From what you have told us about yourself, you also seem to be such a guy. If there is any supernatural entity overseeing this world, then I curse such a megalomaniacal but irresponsible and impotent being for playing such games with us. It really pisses me off how almost no theist ever curses and blames this guy. Thankfully, I gave up on such an entity long time ago, and am happy being an atheist now. When there is no sense of security of being protected by such an almighty being, there is no disappointment at times of peril and grief too. When there is no hope, how can there be any hopelessness and fear at the moment of crisis?? How can there be any sense of betrayal from such an indifferent entity at such times?? There will only be peace of mind knowing that atleast you didn't waste your precious time in life by praying to such an apathetic and egotistical entity. Since you have already given up on him, I hope that your last moments shall also not be filled with such a sense of disappointment and betrayal. 

Though, if possible, try your best to overcome it and get well. But if not, please live your remaining moments to their fullest. Have no regrets. If you are still a virgin (hope not)...get some snu-snu.😎 If there is some cuisine you might want to try, go for it. Don't worry about the lynchers even if it's beef. You can always visit North East or mallu-nation. If there is any place you would like to visit, don't stop yourself. If there is a drink/weed you would like to drink/smoke, don't hold yourself back. Please consult the doctor before you try to pull any stunt though. But, basically live the rest of your life for yourself. BE SELFISH. 

Sorry for the long post, but that's pretty much what I wanted to say. I just got a bit emotional reading your story. 
Also looking at your report, it seems like you were diagnosed with cholesterol which might be the cause and precursor (just pseudo-sciencing here). That serves as a warning for me to get into shape too...Have been gaining some 'tond' recently. 😰 Blame these: 🍝🍕🍔🍟. Kudos to your spirit.Hats off to your attitude.At the outset,I wish to extend strength and a bearhug from my side.I hope and I sincerely do,that you find peace with your existence and with all the going arounds of this world,things that we all have little control over and yet besiege our mental spaces because hell who doesn't want a better world.

Stumbling upon this AMA,trying to grasp what you might be feeling now, this makes me look upon my life like Carl Sagan would have looked upon the pale blue dot of Earth from space,small,petty,filled of meaningless trivial rants,and yet to understand how I could make a teeny difference in the right direction for the good of people around me and myself.

You my brother(I hope I don't come across as pretentious,because well we don't know each other)
are an inspiration.Your mere act of admittance of your current situation and the fact that you would want to give back to the society,to kids,(I read your other comments),is testament to your awesomeness.

I wish upon you these lines from Dinkar,


भुजाओं पर मही का भार फूलों सा उठाये जा,

कंपाये जा गगन को, इंद्र का आसन हिलाये जा,

जहां में एक ही है रौशनी,वह नाम की तेरे,

ज़मीं को एक तेरी आग का आधार है साथी !


 Bhai, Job ke liye reference milega ?

Just kidding!

Hey man, all the best for what the future holds for you. Hope this phase passes soon and you come back stronger than you ever were. Don't count yourself out yet. 

As they say, It ain't over till it's over! You got this! I really like your spirit and hope you live the most before cycle of birth and death takes you along.

\- What are top things you would do if born again? First of all, my condolences. What do you plan to do now? Have you already quit your job? I'm sorry to hear that man. I really hope your recover soon! How did your family reacted to it? And is 26 too old to pursue my masters in Europe(My dream)? Get well soon brother!  I thought long and hard about what to write, but I'm at a loss for words. So here - *hugs*. Sending you lots of good vibes telepathically :) what advice would you give to someone who has failed, or feels like he's failed in every aspect of life Sales Job Hai kya,?  Have you seen Randy Pausch's Last lecture video?  Try giving something to others. It can make you feel better.
Teach others what you know. Especially where it can make a difference in their lives.  bro.. girlfriend hai toh break up karo. go travel. everyone you know will bum you out. dont spend all your money, just incase you survive.

.. and most importantly batao kya chahiye.. russian, israeli ya desi? randia will fund this.

better yet.. go to thailand or something. get aids or die trying Here I am slaving away, losing body and mind. There you, positive attitude against all odds. If you are inNumbai, PM. As someone who has lost brothers and sisters at a young age, please make sure your family is mentally prepared.  Serious: people say meditation helps to calm the mind down. Have you tried it? If yes, did it have an impact? Really want to know? Much love from Bengaluru♥️. You're a fighter even if you shed tears, remember that. Spend each moment on your terms. See you on the other side, though I hope you don't cross over for a long, long time. Overall, be Brilliant and beautiful in whatever you do.
Question(s):
 Any tips for an 18 year old inexperienced twat like myself who's about to go to college? 

What were your fondest moments and who do you want to spend most of your time with now that you have this sense of finite time left?  Big hugs ♥️ things will be okay brother, please PM if you're in Bangalore or Bombay, would love to meet you over a cup of coffee 🙂 Too late to the ama but OP, I think I have an interesting idea. Go to malls, meet random people and have interesting conversations with them. You can have a placard/tshirt describing your condition and your desire to have interesting conversation.  Once you are comfortable with this, start a youtube channel so that everyone can cherish your memories.

May be good fun. Since you were a 1.5 lpm guy, i guess you must have some savings. What are you gonna do with it?

Also, how hopeful are you in our country's future? Do meditation. Try yoga. Shirshasana/sarvangasana improves blood flow to brain. But consult doctor if you can do it. Daru piyega? i.e. if you're in Bangalore I am currently a neurology resident. You can PM me if you have any questions regarding the diagnosis.  Ek sawaal hai \- how was your lifestyle \- good or bad. If bad, where do you think you screwed up? It can be a good wake up call for a lot of 1.5 lpm guys here. And here I was like - 
""Ki aisa mere saath kyun hota hai"".?

Kudos man to you and your courage. :)

I lost a friend not a close one to cancer and I regret meeting him for the last time, due to some misunderstandings between me and him. I have flashbacks of it.

Just one thing I want to say, Go out and meet every person you know and wish to see for the one last time. These experiences can change people life's for Good.

Enjoy your life and Go out there and Kill it.
Aur haan, Tension na le. You will be fine.

Any regrets you have in your life?  [deleted] hey, good to see you holding up.
now that you are here in this point of your life, what do you think about yourself, as a human being? do you think what we are doing on our little earth, matters in this vast, unlimited, expanding universe? 

As a single individual human, merely being a worthless cog of the Human Engine, in which others are spearheading us into our evolution, and still we don't know anything about the cause of our existence, or where we are headed, or does it matter at all, I many times find myself lost in these thoughts. What do you think actually matters? Driving on the Highway the society built for us, or making our own path?

What do you think about the faiths and religions you did/did not followed?  Is it incurable? To accept your own end is as brave as it can get. 

Who knows, maybe you find something else on the other side. 

Hope you have the best time you can in what remains!  Hey man, no questions, just wanted to say all the best! You will come out of this. And if things go South, please don't delete your account. [deleted] Please stay and fight till the end friend.  Hopefully you will be back after a miracle.  Bro, Try yoga, Baba Ramadev ne bola hai Yoga se sab accha hoga.
And If you want chill pill? PING ME! Don't really have anything to ask but good luck with your recovery and keep in mind, miracles can and do happen!  Virtual hug to you. Keep fighting till end. Hey OP , you may not like it but could you make  a series of videos how you perceive life-death-future you or anything you wanna share . Upload it on youtube May i ask when you realized there was a problem and you need a diagnosis? Can we take precautions with checkups in some way? Aur God bless you bhai. I don't want to annoy you with my questions. I will gift you this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7lyYoi2dpE), This is the song which I listen when I am most stressed and drained out.

Theek ho jao bhai, zindagi lambi hai! My cousin died because of blood cancer. He went on and said sorry to all those people who he hurt or said something in past. They all forgive him for the things he has done. He died very peacefully with no regrets about his life.  How many real life friends do you have? How are they helping out these days have you considered donating your organs? you look like the prime candidate for donation, all organs intact, no infectious diseases, and in prime of youth How are you man? Hope you got some good news. Where's your medical proof that you are diagnosed with all that?  You seem really in hurry, even I had to type this message at 1000 w/m. To avoid the chance to roast him the last time.

PS: How was that?? I need feedback if you there....... [deleted] Since you're aware of your situation, are you doing drugs? I guess it would be easier for you to get into it.  Aw shucks man, thats really sad to hear. How does complete detachment from everything around you feel?
 Sorry to hear about you- I hope you can fulfill all your dreams !!
I would suggest make some YouTube videos to teach further so the knowledge never dies !! 
 What are your favourite movies, books, shows, songs etc? We'd love to know! 

Also, hopefully they help you cope with it better. Reading your comments, it feels like you have very few regrets (I may be wrong) and that's something not a lot of us can achieve. Good on you for living the way you wanted to! 

Hopefully your time here has been fun and continues to be. Cheers!

* Just read that you're going back to your hometown to spread some education! There is no greater joy than giving back, and you're one of the very few who will achieve it! So that's really great on you man! Did you had a good time? Hang in there bud and if possible stay strong for your loved ones.I had a friend who knew his time was coming soon and it was heart wrenching.


 Pilani dude?  of all the things i have seen on this subreddit even this site,this make me sad. all i hope is u get well soon.i am not a religious person but reading this i said help him god. How old are you? Are you married? Fuck tension. Let's grab a beer.  Stay Strong Bro ! Totally at loss of words. Feel better today!! Kinda feel happy for you in a wierd way. Knowing I'm stuck in never ending cylce of 8-5 college plus wards plus never ending studies plus bleak prospect of pg entrance plus childhood issues. 

Sorry man. I don't mean bad on you. Have a good afterlife.  Hey sorry for your condition. I want to know how you got the job at UN? Through contacts or are you from a really good university? How old are you? How is your family taking it? Dear /u/aadhaatom
It's not over until it's over. You need to believe that this can pass and you need to fight. And fight harder than you ever have. Tell death to fuck off. If you have to go down, go down fighting! have you thought about saving your sperm? Isn't Megavac an option? I am so sorry bruh, _hugs_ 😭 Adopt a puppy,go to an orphanage and spend time with the kids,go to an old age home and spend time with grannies.Do sewa at a nearby gurudwara/church/mosque/temple (including cleaning shoes if required)...And finally,get laid. I'm so sory, OP. I hope you get well soon, hopefully :). How are your parents dealing with this? What is your biggest regret? Not losing hope. Not having it either (right now) Take care Bhai. My best wishes with you and your family. This is terrible. Hugs and hang in there!

Make a blog or vlog of you teaching kids if you can, you’ll leave behind some crazy amazing motivation for a lot of folks. And keep posting here, I’d be happy to see you pop in every month :) if your doctors are absolutely certain there is no way out, do a complete fast from food for 30-40 days with just minimal water intake. There are magical powers in fasting. I can guarantee you will be cured.  Just a suggestion for increasing you lifespan a few more decades.......get a death mask done. Search it up if you don’t know......im 16 and have decided to do it whenever the time comes. Hopefully you dont need it this time though. And best of luck. Dont want to offend.

But facing the reality

Do you have the urge to travel your heart out? So sad. How old are you? Are getting cremated or buried? Did you choose your coffin or urn? What was that like?  Kudos for dealing with it in this way. I hope you get to live longer. Desire to live and trust in medical can go a long way. And regardless, I hope you enjoy the rest of your life. :) 

Would you like to recommend any movies, games or apps that you absolutely love ? 
Or perhaps you could also share your music playlist ? 

Thanks. You are a strong man.  You still have to be optimistic bro. Just believe in yourself at least ? First of all, kudos on answering so many questions. 
Secondly, best of luck on your endeavors. You are someone who must have a different perspective on a lot of things now. What's something very few of us know about life that you have learnt because of your condition? I  mean you are dying and I might die a little bit late but I'm dying a little bit everyday anyway. Do you see the importance of doing what you want to do over doing what other people want you to do? Would you advise me to take the leap of faith and chose the career that I love or should I stick to the safer option that would get me good salary and  wheatish woman from shaadi.com? You're braver than I can ever aspire to be. Hang in there. Big hugs xx.  I'm trying to imagine myself in your position. I would say, you should think of the things you felt you always missed, and try to make your peace with those things.

If you think you'll miss your family, spend time with them. 

If you feel you want an apple design award, see the inner motivation/desire. Why do you want that award? Recognition? It represents Professional Success for you? 

Let me tell you, the best design is what comes naturally to you. No white guy/Jony Ive/Tim Cook living a 1000 miles away, who doesn't know your life/where you come from, can judge your work. Just draw/paint/design for yourself, remove the need for external validation, because that validation is just a show. Apple isn't the world authority on design. Be satisfied and happy with your own designs :)

What topic do you want to shoot the film on? Do you want to reach out to people? This AMA was pretty successful in that aspect :) Put up some videos on youtube, don't sweat it :)

I would definitely spend time with family, teach kids etc. I think your life would be more successful than mine will ever be, if you manage to make your peace with things :)

 How much time is left? Are you going to die soon? Or memory loss? What changes are you experiencing?

 Did you abstain from meat? 


or eat it in very few quantities?  Was the 9 to 5 worth it? Have u made a will? How about a living will in the eventuality that u end up a vegetable, god forbid. Would u opt for euthanasia? 

Have u quit ur job? Did u vent out at anyone who u ever felt frustrated with?  Since nobody has asked, what's on your bucket list?
 Try brahmi . It's a cerebral vasodilator. And smoke weed for the tension :)
 I eat meat. Quite often nowadays.  Yes of course!  I will pray for you. Stay happy my friend. Thank you for all your questions, comments and wishes. What a great community this is. I felt so relaxed talking to each one of you. Read most of them (except some long ones) and tried answering them. I wish you all well and hope you and I both do good. See you somewhere soon. Sayonara!  Dost, Ek help kar do hum sab ki. Tell us what all of us are collectively doing wrong and what actually matters. Youtube pe video daal do.

Help the world brother. Show us the path. Aur agar Bangalore main ho to milo jaldi se. Sorry brother to hear that, any to do list or any path/goal ? Hey man, hope everything thing will be fine. 
Just make the most of whatever time you have left with you. Travel alone for sometime to your dream destination, spend time with people you love and tell them you love them. Live a happy life 
Hugs A warm hug to you bro!  I'm sure you'll get well soon. Kindly PM. Will love to meet you over a cup of coffee :D  Hope you are doing fine. There is no activity on your account Dude, don't panic. Try to get better first, talk to your family about this. Don't lose hope as yet. You can survive this if you take precautions and are in good care.  Visit a good doctor and start treatment. I'd suggest meanwhile join a vipassana mediation course nearby.

Also is that a bad time to visit? Petrol ka kitna bhaav chal raha hai udhar? Thank you for doing this. I hope to visit Nepal someday.  Few years back I read you guys adopted a new constitution. How has that worked out? Is there any good Nepali porn out there? I visited Lantang region before the Earthquake . It was the most remarkable trips of my life.

Some of the villages then didn't have electricity back then in 2015 but I hope Nepal electrifies all it's villages soon India and Nepal has 2 main meta dynamic. 

One is that of the Indian State/Govt, which basically is hated, disliked, not trusted, etc by Nepalis(state and the people). 

But at people to people level things are more pleasant. This is why the relationship works because the people links are too strong.  


Nepal needs development. And personally I am of the view that settings artificial barriers to it is futile. Development at all costs. Period. Like on a war footing. No compromises. Just get it done at all costs. Deal with the consequences later.   

Even if it means you live less(should not matter given they and poor places anyway has short lives, at least when they are developed they will live those short lives better). Being predominantly Hindu country,Are there many supertisions or are your people over them? Bcoz here mostly Hindu Hindi belt seems to be superstitious as fuck(poverty there could be the reason too). Nepal-India relationship was never the same after the murder of the royal family. Looks like a foreign hand. How do Chinese tourists get around? Is the language barrier significant for them? Could you share the stats by country on Nepali tourism? Is the [royal massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_royal_massacre) still talked about? Any thoughts about the theory that Dipendra didnt do it or that India was involved? How is the massacre regarded in terms of its repercussions? Has it recovered from the earthquake? Ah ! I am quite icky-picky about a communist state. I know definitions are different in East but...

A) What is the current status of communist party of Nepal ? 

B) What is general outlook towards economy ? Are they considering opening up to FDI ? 

C) Are there any discussions about climate change and it's effects ? 

D) Are people aware about debt trap ? 

E) Are Nepali aunties/uncles as nosey and irritating as Indian aunties/uncles ?  I was kind of thinking that India-Nepal relations would get better in case the Modi government falls next year. But was just reading some thread on /r/Nepal and looks like you guys hate Congress even more because they are accused of supporting the Nepali maoists. 

Is there any redemption you see in ties? Lord Buddha was born in India and Garhwal was a part of Nepal before being a part of India.


How many times you guy watch ""Gharwali Bahar waali"" in a month ?








This is what I used to say to my Nepali roommate in college  great job dude to show up and even deal with the entitled a-holes  too.

&#x200B;

Indians, as someone said, are proudest of the least to be proud of.  Nepal should definitely lead the way as it always has done. Kathmandu was global long before india even knew what flower power was. The current reality is that China has made the great leap forward and has 10,000$ per capita income, an aging population and a huge savings hoard...and anyone who partners with them will definitely benefit. For all the talk, China has always been a civilization content with itself, and not expansionist. 

&#x200B;

My dream is that Nepal shows the way and helps be the bridge between India and China ...and thus creates a global powerhouse with 1/2 the worlds population, huge shared landmass and sweet synergy in Manufacturing and Services coupled. We literally wouldnt even need the West. India provides employment opportunities to many Nepalis. they are eligible even for the highest government services in India, and are freely eligible for all sorts of private employment. do you think your government is ignoring vital Indian interests in moving so close to China despite this?

What if India revokes this special treatment to Nepali citizens suddenly? it has helped people of your country so much in the past. its almost like Indians going to US for a better life, but while US needs workforce in those fields (STEM), in case of india its just a goodwill gesture.

Basically, what's an ordinary Nepali's opinion, would you like a friendly India with special all weather friendship, or a more transactional 'what's in it for me' kind of diplomacy where you lean towards anybody who's giving you a better deal in that moment? also consider the cultural similarities between you and India, vs the other side of himalayas (and tibet).  What is the point of switching to democracy when it obviously doesn’t work? Look at the US President! A total nut job! Monarchy means one is trained from the beginning of life to take responsibility and sit in the big chair.

Kudos to the mods for keeping the discussion civil, but in the end it just felt as if she was not up to the task, which in turn made users who asked the question feel as if they were taken for a ride.",an8hu," That was so shit. Can we first set expectations with people before doing these things? Like Imran Khan knows what the reddit audience is like. It's not like Twitter where you give a few curt replies and it's done.  Rana ji writes much words many sentences only in her books. For the online peasants 4 - 5 words max per reply will do. I enjoyed Priyanka Chopra's AMA more than I did that one. That AMA was total shit . I am in future neither gng to read her book nor her stories and i am not a right-winger It has to be one of the worst AMA i have ever seen. Single line single word answers looks like the person was forced to do this.  [deleted] Not understanding the reddit crowd (which loves long, detailed answers) is one thing. She even insulted us when I asked why is she writing one-liners! I think she is a little entitled. I think it wasn't bad. 

Even not answering certain questions, giving one liners or cryptic answers or evading the subject tells a lot about the person.  Look on the bright side. The person more or less gave away too much of info about their attitude.

 Smaller unknown crowd, may or may not buy book, no mention in media, talk to peasant s? Meh, I will better talk on camera on national TV. Many views. Much talks. Wow attention. So much money.

Secondly, avoiding uncomfortable questions with lame excuses. 

Now you know which column or TV show to skip.
 I blame twitter. People have forgotten to be elaborate and expressive. A race to conciseness which carried over to the AMA maybe? Ok quick read through the answers, this was Rampart level shit
 pls ask sir Looked like she was lacking in motivation because she wasn't getting paid to this.. From what the mods said, the fail is understandable. I was more pissed about the chutyap low effort ignorant comments like she recognises only Baghdadis'court, questions about her religiosity getting up voted. Discussion was not civil at all with some of the indirect questions. I may not agree with her work but no one deserves this treatment, at least didn't expect it on reddit. [deleted] There was an AMA? Damn man I generally look forward to subreddit specific ones. Well, at least she answered two-dozen odd (may be more) questions. It was AMAGF  (ask me anything about Gujarat files)

 I think the problem is that her entire area of claimed expertise is one thing and that one thing is detailed in the book she's out to promote.

 >a great AMA session and would be reported by the content stealers like poopshoop tomorrow on their websites, 

Do you even know what you are talking about. When a notable person says something on a social media site should the media just ignore it because it's "" content stealing""?

Should no news site ever report something said on Modi's twitter because that means stealing content from twitter?

This OC circlejerking really has gotten to people's heads. It's ridiculous when you consider a lot of ""Original Content"" on /r/India is lifted from facebook or twitter without giving credit.

---

Hey /r/India,  
**Rahul Yadav** has agreed for an AMA session with us. He's been in the headlines quite a lot recently, and has even been coined as the ""*monk who sold his Ferrari*"" by a [few media outlets](http://www.firstpost.com/business/rahul-yadav-really-monk-sold-ferrari-decoding-housing-com-ceos-rs-200-cr-gift-employees-2243666.html).  

So get your questions ready and let's have an interesting AMA here on /r/india. Please keep in mind that it will be [R]eddiquette enforced so we will be moderating to ensure civility. 

**Bio:**

>Rahul hails from Alwar, Rajasthan where he received his primary education. He later went to IIT Bombay for higher studies, where he created a question bank from old exam papers to build the popular Exambaba.com. Exambaba was made the official IIT-B archive before eventually being shut down. After a brief internship in Israel, Yadav returned to build apps for Google Chrome. And then, in his final year, dropped out of IIT. Later, he joined his friends to co-found Housing.com.

**Date & Time:** May 19^th, Tuesday, 6PM IST.

**Verification**: http://i.imgur.com/T9uPJow.jpg
",AwkwardDev," I just hope he completely attends the AMA and not leave if he find us 'intellectually incapable' of conducting a good AMA! :P  Ooh this should be very very interesting! 

I'll have a bunch of nice questions ready. 


Also, prepare to see a deluge of journalists here now. He's hot topic in the press right now  I bet Deepinder Goyal will be watching over this to see how bad Rahul fucks this up. *grabs popcorn* Yaar this ama will be awesome but this will attract whole bunch of chu media :( THIS IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN ! *goes and giggles in the corner like a black and white movie monster* Will be hard pressed to ask him about middlemen businesses vs creating real tangible value in a country like India I am a Corporate Governance researcher, and I find Rahul Yadav's announcements very interesting and disturbing at the same time. I will be very interested in knowing his thoughts behind:

1. How does he plan to have incentives aligned with success of Housing.com/convince investors that he is motivated, after giving away all his equity to employees. 

2. Is there a grey market for Housing.com shares. How can employees monetize the gift?

3. Isn't there regulation in India, that constrain private firms to have less than 50 investors, before becoming public. In that case, how can the shares be transferred to employees?

4. I have tracked Zillow/Trulia for a while. These firms have mapped a larger geography, and onboarded about a 100,000 agents to pay for ads connected to Zip codes. Still they are struggling with their bottomline, agent retention and agent up selling (They treat agents as their revenue sources, not end use customer). If Housing.com will be following a similar model, is it having success in onboarding agents? Is it having trouble with the unorganized/informal nature of real estate agents? What is being done to mitigate it?

5. Are the online only flash sales of apartments generating any revenue at all? Is it a sustainable model for the future?

6. What happened behind the scenes and how were the board members pacified to retain the CEO? How did men with big egos and the cash to boost, look beyond the tantrums to come to a rational decision? Alright, which one of you requested an AMA with this attention whore? ARE YOU SERIOUS?! maza aaega. rakhi sawwant of startups. lots of yummy questions to ask this guy #LookingUp to it http://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1.gif I have a very genuine question for Rahul, hope it doesn't get moderated.

Rahul, what do you smoke ? how much do you pay for it ? and how many times a day do you smoke it ? You got Rahul- oh. Never mind. Awesome, 
this will gonna be awesome, but it will attract a bunch of rubbish media.  Monk who sold his ferrai? Or the monk whose driver refused to drive unless he gave away his ferrari We are so lucky to have few out of those precious ~3L working hours he is left with! After doing all these stunts.. Do you sleep well? How much do you sleep? **Do you even sleep?** Because I have seen you post on facebook early in the morning at 4 A.M. or 5 A.M.... Your situation is like *""Raaton ki neend gai, din ka chain gya.. kya hota hai ye klook[up] klook[up] klook[up]..."" ???* He is in his chappals btw in that verification pic. :D

edit- No offence meant. Calling Deepinder. This one would b an epic AMA ! I think he'll do a U-turn in the last minute, skip the AMA and flip the bird to all of us. Lets do bets...how long before MSN/ Clickbait sites pick this story up & which one will be first...winner get a puppy people get oil and frying pans ready ;). let me leave now to buy a pack of popcorn :) Going to be a nightmare for the Grammar Nazis.

How did you feel when you realised for the first time that you've only ~3L hours left?  Bhai, IST bole to stretchable time hai kya? 6 to baj gaye! Has the AMA started? How do we use this reddit AMA firstly? Hi Rahul, many thanks for doing this AMA.

My question : **What are the 3 most important things that contribute towards a startups' success in the Indian startup ecosystem?** 

Please be as candid as possible.

 Its happening here guys - http://ss.reddit.com/r/india/comments/36hezf/hi_im_rahul_yadav_ceo_of_housingcom_ama/ When does this start??
 Tell him to get some lube.  This is going to be fun! *Marks the calendar* *Rubs hands in glee* What about Rahul Baba?  There is a lot of confusion in the ecosystem right now, everyone is there with his/her own opinion on the recent events. It is now time we actually hear one side of the story in first person. I am having my college exams and you know engineers study at last moment still I am gonna attend it. I signed up just for this one AMA. No matter what he says, there's going to be roughly equal number of people who admire him, and those that make fun of him.

Sorta, kinda like AK or NaMo. This is one to watch out for, for sure! He's the Balotelli of startups. ♪ Yeh to hona hi tha ♪ But...but...are we worthy? Remind me to here at 6 pm IST on May 19th. /u/remindmebot I hope he stops behaving like his other namesake in politics. It is a great opportunity to get to know his part of the story. I just joined in reddit to participate in this AMA :)  Who would you say has inspired you the most and why? Do you consider yourself successful? Is there more to housing.com than VC money? GUYS BRING YOUR ALTS WITH THE MOST FUCKED UP USERNAMES I hope this session dosent turn into a ROast  [removed] Let the games begin! Just got a reddit handle for this  This is going to be fun....waiting :D 30 minutes to go. Let's see what unfolds!
 Let's say I were to cruise up to your local bar with my IIT D t-shirt. I sit down at the bar and order an overpriced old monk. I grab the remote from behind the bar and change the channel to Roadies. I strut over to the jukebox and play some Linkin Park and ask your old lady for a dance.

How do you feel about Digital India ? What you would be doing. If you leave Housing.com Where is the ama going on ?! what will be your next kick? r u a salman khan fan?? Did you just kept thinking to get an idea or u just got it one night in dreams?
How do you find people with same level of enthusiasm as you for an idea? Why you all are **""Die Hard"" Fans of Steve Jobs**? There were other people on this planet who has done commendable jobs in their fields. IF your resignation was not a publicity stunt what was the reaction of Mr. Shailenra and other board members over your letter? Hey Rahul,
How you are able to take such big decision in very short time? can we start?
 give some tips on your digital marketing campaigns according to me they are huge i mean you are everywhere on the internet (housing.com) Why you all are **""Die Hard"" Fans of Steve Jobs**? There were other people on this planet who had done commendable jobs in their fields.   Are you planning to open housing office in Seattle?
Just curious because my current home is having water pipe burst...:-) when will you enter into the sf and give a kick to us startups?
lets play a story telling video on the home page instead of static html pages
bull shit?? What does Rahul have to say about the comments comparing him to Arvind Kejriwal? Nice. Say what you want about his behavior, he has been more successful than 99% of the people on r/india. Looking forward to the AMA. This looks like 100% PR stunt... Rahul, are you Rakhi Sawant? don't rediquette tag the AMA  The best thing about this is that he is going to literally Answer Your Anything... Interesting...

Some background info: The summer of 2009, me and my best friend discovered that if we dressed sharp and smelled right, nobody would bother asking us if we belong at a wedding.

I had a Luna back then and we would drive around a popular area here in Hyderabad with a large number of function halls and visit each one until we couldn't eat anymore.

Edit1: Off to sleep. Go ahead and ask any questions you have, will reply tomorrow. Cheers and goodnight.

Edit 2: And that'll be all folks. This was super fun! Thank you for all the questions.",DudeWheresThePorn," Envelopes, empty envelopes or no envelopes?  Gurudev, Saturday Wedding Crasher here, give your ashirwad so that I reach half of that. My base is Kaushambi/Ghaziabad Delhi NCR. Do you provide a service where you can replace me in the weddings I have to go to? What was your plan B? What’s your motivation?  What kind of weddings did your gang usually target? Big ones or small ones? 

Hindu ones or Muslim ones?

Did you do any kind of homework before attacking, like what to wear, whom to shake hands with, learn what their names are? 

Did you ever run into someone you knew at any one of those weddings? 


RANDIA WANTS TO KNOW! how big are indian weddings? how many people in average? Did you sing ""Mein to Ainvayi Ainvayi e lut gaya"" Narrate the scene of you gate crashing a wedding from the start. I've hit almost half your amount. Your post makes me feel this like an accomplishment! Well  in Hyderabad, people actually don't care if you gate crash a wedding , usually there is way too much food  and we Hyderabad's are generous about food. 

Op , what is your favourite function hall? Was there a time when you got caught but still the host invited you for free food?

Also tell me about a bad experience you encountered Sir Hum Science Ki Taraf Se hain 1969?

Lootera unkill.  Summer of 69?

You mean 1969? Although I'm late to the party, as a former pro wedding crasher let me slide in some pro tips too.

1. The most difficult thing for first timers is to get in, especially when you see family members or relatives at the entrance. The best thing to do now is to put your phone on flight mode and start talking on the phone while walking towards the entrance. My usual conversation would be to an imaginary friend who is also coming to the party and is getting late. Take pauses, smile, as him his location etc etc. 99 times out of 100 no one will bother you.

2. There have been weddings where I reached at 8 and they didn't start the food till 9. Don't be an asshole who keeps eating every starter in a thin crowd. Eat like a gentleman. Be specific in requests. Be picky. (rich people are picky). Ask for nothing less than Black Dog or Chivas Regal (at the bar) or Blender's Pride if it is a gareeb shadi of people pretending to be rich. Show the waiter you belong. Best course of action is to take some thing and peacefully sit where all the aunties are and enjoy the performance on the stage (if there is any) till the food starts. [All this was for 5 star hotel, farm house wedding crashes] 

3. Be dapper. If you think your clothing is just good enough, you'll not be so confident. Be the best. Not just good enough. Confidence is key guys. And it comes from your clothes. 

4. You'll see the where the hottest looking aunties and their drop-dead gorgeous daughters, who are, unfortunately, also dressed in their best. DON'T FUCKING LOOK AT THEM, either at the mother or the daughter. Don't make them uncomfortable. Just admire once and move on. Accepting the fact that you will never get them. Eat and leave. 

5. If you are at the wedding with a friend. Never do meta level talks of how cool that you both did this. Talk about movies, assignments, Netflix etc. No meta.

6. If the cameraman is coming to you while you are at it, don't be sacred. Smile for the camera. No one fucking cares. 


7. At Muslim weddings there can be separate eating areas for Men and Women. Don't go to the women's area please.

8. If you can't hold your liquor, don't drink.


9. You can do this. I had a Tamil friend who couldn't speak a word of Hindi who used do this with me. He fucking used to for the extra kick of going to the bride and groom and congratulating them in heavily accented English in the capital of UP. So if he can, you can too. 

10. If you are married, you have nothing to fear. Nothing. Take your wife to weddings with pride. No one will touch you. No one. You sound like my aunt but she used us(we were kids) are a great prop.  Aren't Andhra/Telengana weddings mostly Veg? When I am in college I go to whoever wedding is happing in city no body ask you. Me and my friends never got caught In Hyderabad theres a joke that when questioned, a gate crasher said he was from the groom's side. It was a child's circumcision party 🙄 Mr. Nograj from the principal's office would like to speak with you.

https://youtu.be/J-iM3TjEcx8
 120.. You gotta pump up those numbers.. Those are rookie numbers..  ABCD here. What do ppl do at the reception? Do you have any chances to hit on girls or is too conservative so not tolerated? In US weddings this is the main motive for single men to go to the reception: to hit on chicks and to get wasted on free booze.  I am getting gareeb *Ocean's eleven* vibes from this thread. 

Just kidding.

Do your parents know about this? I mean you won't be able to have dinner after eating at a wedding. [removed] What fragrances do you wear? how much weight did you gain? This post is giving me some real motivation to crash Isha's wedding. Hopefully, I don't have to crash though.  In my city, rich people put it on local news paper asking people their wishes and asking them to come to marriage. Great great 
 great food.  I will find you and gate crash your wedding  Will you be attending my wedding ? Imma call it a night and tuck in for the day. Do ask me any further questions and I'll reply to them in the morning.

Cheers guys! How old you are ? Of those 120 weddings which one stands out? And why?
In those 120 in how many you were invited?  Got into the business one night I was extremely hungry and had the peak season on !!! Got into a cab for a place 2 km away from my place and crashed the party. Turns out the experience was great and got hooked on !!! 

Now I gained a lot of weight 129 kg in fact and trying to get back in shape ;( Has anyone ever suspected pr caught you? What did u do? Once me and my friend went to some wedding inside iit bombay campus and we enjoyed a lot scared initially but then it got better. Any wedding story that strikes out from the rest? If you ever get caught, what's your strategy to deal with the situation?  You guys crashed 120 weddings in how many days/months ? Did any lead to.coitus? You made me laugh today bro. It was fun to read your comments I recently graced the occasion( tier 2 city,approx 500 in attendance) uninvited but a chick who knew me spotted me. She was on my radar for a while so I tried to pick her up but too many people stared suspiciously. I managed to save myself from the embarrassment of getting caught somehow.
Whats your story/stories of people picking/approaching single chicks at weddings. Hey were they Hindu or Muslim weddings? If later , was there Bhagara rice? [removed] Which perfume do you recommend? [removed] Ever gate crashed the suhaaarat? And I thought crashing 30 weddings had to be a damn lot. You sir are good. I don't even get this. 50% of the people in Hindu weddings nowadays are just randsoms. they eat the food and leave. most people don't stop them since they are scared they might curse the wedding or someshit. I would possibly go to every wedding I could but I just hate the fucking sweaty people cramped into a hall eating shitty food rip.. Did you and your group owned the dance stage too? Dancing like crazies would've raised quite a few eyebrows.  Oh....i have gone to around 50 to 60 weddings with my friends.....always enjoyed.....Just Like OP said....you could try if you want Which was the most lavish wedding you crashed into ? ever got caught""? Favorite function hall in Hyderabad? If the AMA is still active, wanted to ask shaadi me laundiya patayi kya. Agar haan, to story please. * What is the best meail you recall
* What was the closest moment of getting caught

Can we discuss on improving AMAs given how some of them ended up being disastrous?,31,680ogd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/680ogd/can_we_discuss_on_improving_amas_given_how_some/,20,Recently we have seen some big names on ama on r/India and I wonder if we can improve on some fronts. What are your suggestions?,sargasticgujju," For a celebrity like say,Deepika Padu. 

You can't ask idiotic pointless questions like ' Would you reconsider endorsing fairness product if I show you how it affected women's lives negatively? '

Instead you ask, ' heyyy deeps, I and my sister waved at you at the airport and you smiled back, that was the best moment of our lives. She would literally cry if you type ' Happy birthday bubbli ' '


Then they will reply enthusiastically and energetically. 

 Arnabs AMA was almost guaranteed to be a train wreck. I don't think you can qualify the AMA as a disaster as it did give us a very meaningful insight into the kind of journalist he is. 

Problem is, India has the whole ""high power distance"" thing where people who are important are rarely ever asked uncomfortable questions and that's why the AMA is a complete anachronism for them. 

 * Ban all users who ask uncomfortable questions to the celebrity.

* Make it impossible to downvote the celebrity's replies.

* Provide all the questions to the celebrity a week in advance, in the actual AMA post make it so that only the celebrity can participate by posting the questions they like and answering them. 

* All the questions and answers should be prepared by the celebrity's PR team and they post them at regular intervals during the AMA duration while redditors are not allowed to comment.

 Whenever there's a political or even tangentially politics related AMA, rindians don't even try to hide asking incredibly pointed, partisan questions, expecting the AMA host to somehow put his/her hands up and say, ""haha you got me, I am a chutiya!""

Before someone tries making this rubbish point, phrasing a pointed question formerly doesn't diminish from the fact it is pointed. 

These people come on reddit to try and interact with fans and the unconvinced in ways not ordinarily possible. They don't need to come on the internet and have a grilling session of questions that makes a good Opposition's grilling during the PM's Questions Hour seem tame. No one is going to bend over backwards and explain the calculus of high level business and political decisions in a country as, to put it one way, 'complex' as India to strangers on reddit. When a professor or teacher finishes a lecture and says ""please, ask any questions if you have,"" would you take that as a license to start drilling them on their ideological biases influencing this introductory course's lectures or about how their spouse is having an affair with the family driver? Common sense.

This is true of both the BJP and Leftist bhakts here whenever their 'opponents' do an AMA or such, as if it's their chance to earn Modi's or Sonia's or Kejriwal's special praise for doing their job for them. There should be a filter for AMAs by the mods, 
I'm quite sure only the AMA was meant for regular redditors and not for the newbies who just make an account to ask a question and leave

Atleast the questions should filtered out so as to allow only accounts older than 3-6 months with some activity to ask questions in AMA 

Also delete comments with more than two questions. And put a serious tag so unnecessary questions are not asked or answered.

Also the people who literally have paragraphs ready for copy pasting and taking up space, should be deleted immediately, they aren't gonna be answered and it makes other people asking questions difficult. >   I wonder if we can improve on some fronts.

Only if AMA went back to being natural and not like the Fake Q&A format of News channels where the answers are pre-recorded or certain questions are not answered. Unfortunately, the people who do AMAs care more about their image than about having a honest conversation and reddit.com enables this.",AMA,2017-04-28 11:31:34

Interview with Shashi Tharoor: “To give the British credit for things that were never intended to benefit India is a mistake”,158,626gv6,http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/interview-with-shashi-tharoor/,10,,d-u-b," This happens quite often actually. For example, Alexander the Great is credited with bringing Hellenism to the east and enriching the culture of the Middle East, but his only motivation was conquest.

Similarly, Genghis Khan sometimes gets credit for expanding contact between Europe and East Asia and improving trade along the silk road. However, his motivation was again purely conquest.

I think it's important to both recongize the benefits which these kinds of actions may bring about, but also to recognize that these are mostly accidental side effects rather than intentional altruistic actions.

EDIT: A word. Nail them even hard, Shashi.  If not for that AMA this post would have been on top today. 

Well, on a different note, as much as I respect Mr Tharoor, I think that AMA was a bit disappointing. He could have done way better. Majority of questions were answered in a line or two, not to mention that he even refused to answer some. And why were 100's of questions asked based on book suggestions? Kind of ruined that thread.  Dr Shashi Tharoor was recently in the UK to promote his new book Inglorious Empire: What the British did to India. While visiting LSE, he spoke to Sonali

> * Unwittingly yes, in other words things that were brought into India to further British interests, ensure British control or add to British profit have since independence been converted by the Indians to things that benefit India.

> * But to give the British credit for something that was never intended to benefit India in the first place is a bit much.

> * So, you see for example that the railways are so indispensable, the lifeblood in many ways of India today, but you forget that they were only intended to extract resources from the heartland to the ports in order to ship them off to England, and send troops out to keep the peace or British order.

> * That was their attitude so again, one cant give the British credit.

so apparently this is what he said a year back here on his AMA. 
Was this a sign ?

",MyPenisBatman," There is a context to that statement. 

Plus asking out girls nicely in a bar(which is an appropriate place to ask a girl out, instead of workplace) is not harassment.  Yes, it is a sign of you thinking that guys asking girls out on a date are sexual predators. By this logic, tinder is an early sign of orgy. A sign of what? Him being a single, heterosexual man looking for casual sex? scoopwhoop get in here
 You skipped this part:

>be VERY NICE to them

It's literally in the same line. Abhe chal chutiye.  Why are you confusing asking girls out for harassment? It is okay to ask girls out. It is not okay to pass sexual remarks or touch inappropriately without consent. I can't read sarcasm in the end(BE ..VERY NICE to them) - what does he mean? Of course, you can ask every single girl out. But if she sayd no, then leave her alone and move on. 

 Wow, his English is fucking atrocious, nothing wrong with it but just came as a surprise to me.  i just read the top comment of that thread accusing the AMA to be rigged by Anurabh. LUL. All the media reports are talking about ""several"" women coming forward... 

And I could only find that medium post and one Reema.

AMA with SHAKTI team,116,96xwjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/96xwjg/ama_with_shakti_team/,93,"Hi r/india,

We are a team of students and project staff from IIT Madras working on Shakti processor program. We recently taped-out one of our cores on Intel's 22 FFL technology node and have been successful in powering on the chip and booting linux on it. This is a IO heavy test chip meant to provide a POC(Proof of Concept) and is not meant for direct consumption.  We are excited to answer your queries! Ask us Anything!!

Our new website : [shakti.org.in](https://shakti.org.in)

Edit:

Thanks for your queries r/india. It was a pleasure interacting with guys. Glad to see many tech enthusiasts in here.

Hope to see you in a new AMA with our new processor. 

We are signing off. Thanks again!!",shaktiteam," Hi, I'm excited to see you taking an AMA. I heard about your recent tapeout of Shakti cores. The second public tapeout of risc-v in the world. Congratulations!

I have a few questions:

1) I understand the stages of software design, but hardware is opaque. Can you give us a overview of the stages of processor design? What stages cost the most time? Which ones take the most manpower? 

1A) I remember reading that AMD Zen team spent 2 million man hours over 4 years to design the replacement to Excavator. Since I don't understand much about hardware, how can a small group of entrepreneurs and academics hope to put up the enormous amount of effort needed to build and validate a processor design?

2) Can you elaborate on your power, performance, area and especially security design goals for your server and desktop class processors? I've read your website but it only mentions features and clockrate of the processors. Compared to the best Intel server and desktop chips of 2018, what is your performance goal? 50% as good? 80%?

2A) I'm not asking you to commit to delivering chips on any time frame, but once again, due to my ignorance of hardware, I don't have any idea of how long your chip design efforts will take. To meet your design goals for servers and desktop as detailed in 2), how long do you estimate it will take your team to design these chips? 5 years? 10 years?

3) I'm given to understand that the x86 processor family was not designed for security. The processor design grew organically over time, so it's as full of holes as Swiss cheese. What systematic hardware and software design changes, if any, are you taking to avoid the security failures of x86, ARM and MIPS family?

4) I'm concerned about the security of RISC-V chips. The chip design world is spending a lot of time and money to formally verify the risc-v ISA and creating chip designs, but they're writing drivers and other hardware level software in C or C++, which has had almost 50 years to prove itself insecure. I understand that you will need to write code in C for Linux related matters, and I don't expect that to change. However, have you considered using more secure languages like Rust for software that does not have to be in C/C++? 

I'm pointing this out because whatever language you use for your risc-v project is going to be in use 50 years from now. I really don't want to be using insecure software in 2068. Have you given any thought to this? You have stated on your bitbucket-site that there will be six (or eight) versions of cores, I have seen progress on three of those. What is the timeline for the rest of the processors? 
 Another question: Have you guys considered a copyleft license for your project like Cern Open Hardware License? 

BSD-style licenses allow for one-way transfer of intellectual property, whereas copyleft licenses like COHL keep the pool of intellectual property in the public domain. 

Using a permissive license like BSD will make it very easy for companies to take your design and make it proprietary, but its not the right license if you want to create a open hardware ecosystem. 

Why would a company like Samsung take your design and put 250 million dollars of investment to take it to the next level of quality, if the BSD license allows Apple to show up, take the results of Samsung's hard work and make it proprietary? 

BSD and Linux projects have been around for the same length of time, but while Linux has taken over the world, BSD is stagnant. Companies don't use permissive licenses for software unless they control that stack and it's not a core part of their business. Permissive licences create silos but an open hardware community needs a two-way, copyleft license. 

Due to the incentives your license creates, I expect companies and academics to take your work but not give anything back. An open hardware community based on your team's work is all but impossible. Have you considered changing the Shakti project's license? Hey there!

First off, great job and congratulations! 

What advice would you give to a 2nd year student who loves processors and wants to learn how to build them? Where would you have me start with this and what resources (books, software, etc.) are available? 


Thanks in advance!  Amazing work. Have few queries
1. Any plans to develop custom unix based OS for the processor? 
2. Any Plans to make integrated GPGPU system with industry? what is the process involved in testing these chips? Hi /u/shaktiteam, welcome to /r/India. Here are some of the questions that were posted on the announcement thread:

From /u/nascentmind

> Since you mentioned ""interconnect fabrics"", and I am speculating from the POV of high performance computing...what are the prospects of RISC based systems for taking over the next generation of hardware?

From /u/mynameissomethingtoo

> Congratulations to you guys.

> This is unrelated, but would you like to comment on the Spectre and Meldown vulnerabilities recently detected in Intel chips? Can you guys dumb down what exactly had happened and why was everyone freaking out?

From /u/Modi-iboM

> Questions, because I will surely miss the time slot:-

> 1) Any timeline of when we will see these processors on a motherboard?

>2) Can we see DMESG output?

>3) When should we expect Indian supercomputer with these chips running? Will Intel withhold their facilities when they come to know that these chips will be used for supercomputing purpose? Can Taiwanese fabs be roped in at that time?

From /u/dylan522p

> Why are you using Intel 22nm FFL over a more standard Fab for a first tapeout/model, such as TSMC 28nm?

From /u/innovator116


> I am emphasizing here as I have said globally, that RISV-V will need small scale semiconductor fabs model to become ubiquitous. When small groups will not just be able to implement RISV-V based microprocessors but manufacture them as well locally.

> My question is, has the IIT-M team has reached out to IISc groups working on nanopatterning lithography technologies? A national consortium to design, develop and manufacture ICs domestically is need of the hour.

> Proprietary hardware is bound to contain backdoors for Americans or Chinese.

From /u/up-sky-7

> Do you plan on releasing everything as FOSS (100% Libre), even the GPU?

From /u/kipboye

> Hey there!

> First off, great job and congratulations!

> What advice would you give to a 2nd year student who loves processors and wants to learn how to build them? Where would you have me start with this and what resources (books, software, etc.) are available?

> Thanks in advance!

From /u/pcein

> Great to see the amazing work you are doing, and thanks for the AMA! A few questions:

   > Can a hobbyist like me try out the SHAKTI processor on an FPGA dev board (like the Zedboard)?
    You mentioned a ""Rust based OS"" for supporting tagged ISA's in a recent HN post. Are any details regarding this available?
    At the moment, SHAKTI seems like a mostly IITM-only project - any plans on getting the FOSS community involved in it to a greater extend?



 Hi Paul, ssup, so prod to see this day, never thought I would see a batch,ate of mine doing an AMA on randia :')

So how long before this will be ready for applications in real world? 

 Right now I think the manufacturing is done in the us, are there any plans for manufacturing in india?  Is only GCC and Glibc ported as well?  I always thought RISC processors were more suited for low-power/embedded applications. TIL you can also put them in HPCs.  

1. If I had the hardware, what is the fastest way to compile simple c code ? What tools do I need?  

2. I'm bit rusty on systems knowledge, but writing LLVM backend for RISC must be more difficult than, say x86? Because adapting generated IR would be exposed to more instructions?  

3. Are there any plans to make a GPGPU using risc-v ? 
4. Are you guys hiring? For what positions? [deleted] [deleted] Great to hear about your progress. A couple of questions:

1. Are you going to stick with RISC-V for the foreseeable future or are you open to getting ARM/MIPS licenses and changing out the front end to support a different (and more market oriented) ISA?

2. Any timelines on the I class cores? Those would be the most important for any kind of server/HPC efforts I'm guessing.

Thanks for taking the time to do this! Thank you for doing this! 
I have read into your new amazing web-page and also seen the presentation from Neel Gala at Chennai. What is the difference between the Aeon and the F-Class as well as the difference between the T-Class and Aegis?  Have you run coremark/ulpmark on it? Hello. Congratulations on your great success. I was aware of your team's work through Kunal Ghosh. 

Here are my questions: 

Q1. Do you plan to ship a bit of FPGA fabric (customizable logic) along with RISC-V cores? It might help us to build accelerators for some common tasks..

Q2. Is it the RISC-V instruction set as it is or some extra instructions have been included like single cycle MAC for developers who might be interested in using it for DSP?

Q3. IIT Madras has a very strong data converters team under the very famous Shanthi Pavan. Any plans to integrate a ADC and/or a DAC? Will be useful for DSP and senser node applications.. i read it as AMA with SHAKTIMAN n was like wtf for few seconds.  Does the license allow other organizations to build on top of your design? Arduino like movement?
I would love to try a SBC like Raspberry Pi but with Shakti. I have seen in the latest workshop from the RISC-V foundation that there is a company started by Neel Gala and G S Madhusudan called Incore Semiconductors. What is the university's relationship to this company and who is developing what? 

thanks in advance and for doing this AMA!  I have heard that the government is very interested in the project and is sponsoring it to some extent. What does this mean for India and the ability to be independent of other countries? Is this something that is seen as a big deal or is it just a side benefit?  It is awesome that you are doing this. I have also seen your recently created twitter-account. Is this a deliberate plan by you and will we see more cool stuff on twitter and other news from you?  Awesome news on your progress. 

Is there a timeline of when we will see some, if not all, of these processors on a motherboard?  Hi, team SHAKTI!
Congratulations on the wonderful job!
1. Is there any estimate when would SHAKTI be released?
2. How competent and well versed is shakti-linux so far?
3. Are the boards going to be preloaded with shakti-linux?
4. How should other distros approach compatibility with the C class and S class processors?    
 What do you think about possibility  development of the processors in large scale  for mobile and Embedded computers in india ?

 if no what are the resources we lack, and we living in chennai is there anything we can contribute ? Have u thought of designing a Bitcoin Mining Chip? If not, would u mind to take up such a project? Can you also do analog microprocessors? What wrong with the SSL cert on [https://shakti.org.in/](https://shakti.org.in/) ? shakti.org.in - ur site has SSL error :( Any chance Shakti processors would be used for graphics acceleration like broadcom videocore? Just one question, how many years of study will it take for my uneducated ass to understand anything about the above topic..?? noob question but why risc-v instruction set? why not invent your own instruction set? My question is:

Do you plan on switching to an alternative of Bitbucket like [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/), [Savannah](http://savannah.gnu.org/) or any other [FOSS one](https://degooglisons-internet.org/alternatives?l=en)?

*Note:* *Because of how this AMA was organized, people have asked questions in* [*this*](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/96o115/ama_announcement_members_of_the_shakti_project/) *post as well, thinking that the AMA will be there.

Is it monsoon there? What the daily life there like? What's your regular diet? How are the beaches? It's a dry place isn't? 

I had been there when i was 11. My uncle used to work for Lighthouse department. Beautiful place and amazing fish curries  is it expensive for outsiders Why Kavaratti is in bottom 10 in the list of ease of living? It's been a lifelong dream of mom to visit Lakshadweep. She couldn't do it when she was in service because of leave constraints and other life issues .

But I wish to take her to Lakshadweep one day.

But I have heard someone needs to sponsor your visit, otherwise it's going to be costly or a lengthy procedure to arrange the trip.

Could you put some light into it? What do people do for recreation?  How to reach there for vacation ?? How much does land cost there? Is it possible for Mainland/Andaman-Nicobar resident's to buy land in Lakshadweep?

- Person tired of city life. Are women now allowed to wear bikinis to the beach or it's still advised against doing that? 1) How's the scuba diving scene there? Extensive/touristy/worth it?

2) Are there homestays or any ways a mainlander can stay with a local?

3) Have the islands changed, ecologically, with more tourism over the past decade, if at all there has been any? [deleted] How often do you visit the mainland India Are you guys fluent in Hindi?  Are there colleges/universities  [removed] How many honeymoon couples do you see daily.  Do people grow their own food? or is most of it shipped?

Do things cost more on the island? Is there an airport or ships and boats only?

And what about the electricity? 

Do you guys ever worry about flooding or giant tsunamis? Can non locals buy property there?  What kind of jobs do people have there?

What about the younger generation, do most people work in the mainland or do they get jobs in Lakshadweep? 2 questions. Can one go on a solo trip to lakshadweep from Cochin?. Let's say if a place on a boat is arranged, how tough it is to get ilp in Cochin without actually booking a tour?

U/Arnab-G should go to Kapil's show for launch advertisement. ,SupremLeaderModi," Nobody knows the future. We never saw it cumming! Short answer No long answer, for every AmA there is a hidden agenda either to highlight a point or to promote or advertise it, so crying foul over it is pointless, the only thing you can do is to boycott the foresaid AmA  Even big AMAs by Hollywood Celebrities are to promote their movies. Why do you think they'd even do this?

  No you can't. Do you really think that celebrities care about a tiny community of edgelords, most of whom don't even live in India? 

If they do an ama, you know it is because they want exposure after the media picks it up. Lets start all future AMAs with a self criticism by the subject.  Celebrities don't care about us 'chota' people, friend. Unless they have a chance to advertise or promote what they are working on, they literally have no reason to do the AMA. 

There are always exceptions though.  Nope, you can't force any one to answer questions.",AMA,2017-04-28 01:26:38

TOI picks up the cheerleader AMA for their own story [NP],397,35gj1k,http://i.imgur.com/pzj9CG4.jpg,100,,anuj0682," [deleted] I know you're in here TOI, NDTV. I know you're reading this. Show yourself and have a real AMA.  Everything on reddit can be used by any type of media. They have credited reddit India so it's all well and good.  Fuck I hope she is not going to be in trouble 

The 13 year old stupid daughter or the cronies of his dad could be the asshole snitch :(  ITT - Nobody mad at TOI but OP. BC what's the problem? I even like the issues they have taken up, gora bias, ogling. They are a news website, of course their job is to report interesting things. They have even given the source. Bhak. What do the mean by ""fancy degree"" ? Anthropology is fancy? As long as they have mentioned the source I see no issues with it. ITT: is it TOI? lets hate it Hey ToI what about the IIT dean AMA? atleast they dint distort anything , unlike troll.in  I have an idea. Just for the sake of fucking with the media, let's fabricate stories and AMA s. Lets see if they can differentiate fact from fiction. Would love to see TOI reports on fictional incidents.  Please copy paste something from r/gonewild. Toi  chor  bc   Good old days of small community randia are over Misleading title , let's move on. I think we should make a interesting n troll AMA, let TOI and others pick it up. And then we post that it was troll. What fun, next time they won't do this copy-pasta ever. Bc these journalists are fucking shameless.  But this article says that she is South African. I thought the lady who did the AMA was American. She had no clue about cricket before IPL.   Jaane do yar, unn ka kaam he hai copypasting. I have a question.

 I did read that ama and I believe the cheerleader in question stayed anonymous, didn't she?. Putting up a pic and a name in newspaper might affect her job yoo, no?

Okay I see she was already kicked out. Man this is disgusting. [deleted] Oh so these women have big degrees then why work in a field where they will be treated as a sex object?

Buzzfeed will go all out on this. Wait for it.  The comment about religion and Hindu-Muslim interaction was the best! 






EDIT: 

Question: **staring at you and bursting in tears
Are indians pious people in real life as they are shown in movies?**



*What's the bit about staring at me and bursting into tears? 

Yes and no. Some are deeply religious, others are kind of convenience Hindus. Generally, as it is the world over, the poorer people, or more specifically, those with a low locus of control over their existence, are more pious.

Like my mechanic, Khan. When we first met, his life was going well. Then his brother-in-law (or brother?) died, and he had to look after his niece and nephew, and his mother, and his wife, and his sister(in-law). Eight people I think were living in a shitty apartment the size of my current bedroom, and grandma is getting really ill and needs lots of medication, and his hands start to go - early arthritis. I asked him what he was going to do about it one day (I kept getting unneccessary work done on my bike just to give him money because if I ever tried to give him any he'd say 'Mai bekar nahin hoon' (I'm not a beggar/destitute/useless person). I asked him what he was going to do and his response was ""Sab uppar-wale ke hath mein hai"" which means ""Everything is in upstairs guy's hands"". As his life became worse, his faith in Allah grew stronger. Kinda understandable, really.

But the fascinating thing about India, and Hinduism (because even Muslim Indians are kinda Hindu-ey in a way), is that it's generally so inclusive. If you don't believe in god, that's cool, if you do, that's cool. Also there's a saying that there's 330 million (or billion) gods. There's one for getting pissed, there's one for getting angry, there's one for sitting on your arse and hoping that opportunities come your way. I think that makes Indian culture more accepting.

People would ask ""What religion are you"" and I'd say ""I don't believe in any of them"" and they'd be like ""Yeah nor do I, but what religion are you?"" - for many of them it's like a nationality more than a belief structure.

That said, there are many others who take it deadly seriously. Far right religious Hindus are scary fuckers, as are Muslims as we know. 

For some light-hearted weirdness, read about the [Mahim Creek sweet water incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Mumbai_sweet_seawater_incident) where people believed that Mahim creek was manifesting a miracle and the water had turned sweet, so thousands turned up to drink it.

I used to catch the train or ride past Mahim creek on a daily basis. It smelled pretty awful. Like you knew you were almost at Bandra because suddenly poop filled your nostrils. [This river is fucking black. Like seriously, black water.](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Bandra+Reclamation+Flyover,+Bandra+West,+Mumbai,+Maharashtra+400050,+India/@19.0355051,72.8217528,8945m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x3be7c93b1adbc519:0xe7ee8be4398d1188!8m2!3d19.0498789!4d72.8377584) and people were like ""It tastes less like shit today"" and everyone turned up and drank it. So yeah, there's some crazy levels of belief in India. Also note, for comedy's sake: The people drinking this water are obviously having to take the word of someone who regularly drinks this water in order to say it's sweet 'today'.

And then the religion bit is almost totally separate from the cultural bit (not really, but kinda). There are many cultural behaviours that people just 'do' regardless of the belief behind them, like turning up to temple or wearing a string bracelet or having a 'rakhi brother'. Generally people who wear the dots are religious, everyone else, less so.

That's a long answer. I became hugely fascinated with belief while I was there, and hence have lots to say on it.*

Greetings [/r/India](https://www.reddit.com/r/India)!

Tomorrow, August 24, marks the first anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision on the Right to Privacy judgement. This marked an important point for the conversation around what it means to be free. To love, to share and to learn. Privacy makes a lot of this possible. An essential part of a privacy right is to ensure India gets a law that protects people from the harmful use of digital technologies that profile and surveil them. One of the efforts to make sure this legal reform takes place is the SaveOurPrivacy campaign which has proposed a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 that is open for feedback and comment. Some of the lawyers and policy experts will join the Reddit community today between 6:30 - 7:30 IST to chat on not only this campaign but reflect in the broader privacy issues including the social media communication hub, mass CCTV deployment, Cambridge Analytica.

If you have privacy badger installed on your browser, show up. If you use duckduckgo, show up. If you didn't link your Aadhaar to anything, show up. If you worry about strong encryption preventing law enforcement agencies from doing their work, show up!

Collectively, we are the #SaveOurPrivacy drafting volunteers. Our twitter handles are below.

&#x200B;",SaveOurPrivacy," Hi! Thank you for your awesome work, and of course, the AMA. We have a few questions
which probably stem from a limited understanding of law in general, and this proposed
bill in particular. 

## Definitions:

1. Would you consider location data, call records, and behavioral data, as 
constituents of personal data? Are these covered under the proposed bill, or are
these to be treated separately?

2. Clause 2.1.b Is psedonymised data a permissible alternative for businesses to
claim that they have suitably anonymised the data?

3. Does the 2.1.h definition of _communication_ encompass keystrokes, screenshots
and other electronic signals that may enable creation of PII? Will back-channel
attacks to steal encryption keys be construed unlawful under the provision of this
bill?

4. The GDPR definition of personal data [includes](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-personal-data_en):
      > Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the 
      > identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data.  
      
   Does the definition in 2.1.u personal data incorporate this aspect?


## Scope:

1. How does the bill treat personal data of minors under 13? This is a lucrative
user base for certain industries, and we have seen quite a few data breaches 
involving children's data.

2. How will the current Lawful Intercept regime be impacted by such a bill? Will
this lead towards the creation of special, FISA-like courts, with unfettered powers?

3. Suppose civic volunteers create a database in the form of a spreadsheet to help 
distressed individuals during a natural calamity which they then forget to dispose off.
Will the proposed Privacy Commission act suo motu, to ensure safe disposal of such zombie data? 

4. The current interpretation of [public order](https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/free-speech-and-public-order-1)
requires relevance, and mandates proportionate action, for greater good. However, we see 
the phrase ""public order"" has become [increasingly popular](https://imgur.com/a/6ta3xt9) in recent case records. Do you
foresee abuse of this provision in near future?

5. While _ex post facto_ laws are notoriously difficult, Article 20 does not particularly
forbid such a law (Sujjan Singh v. State of Punjab). Do you see a parallel in businesses
which continue to profit from data collected at an earlier era and the corruption case?

## Business Impact:

1. Do you see the need for a transition period to allow businesses to incorporate
the recommendations, and streamlining the proposed Privacy Commission's processes?

2. Per the provision of 5.1.3 an Airbnb host can install CCTV cameras which become
a nightmare for a guest at a later time. How do you propose the bill deal with such
cases?

3. Suppose the medical history of a comatose patient, suffering from a rare disease,
is of interest to researchers. Is it then the next-of-kin's decision whether or not
to share the data? 8.3 discusses unsound mind, but not unsound health.

4. Will such a bill thwart IP that hinges on sensitive data? See the recently filed
[Google patent](https://twitter.com/PrivacyMatters/status/1032183690447806464).

5. Do employers need informed consent before installing packet inspection software
on devices provided to employees that are used off-premises? Also, how would you
treat this [recent](https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1032543799258431488) case.

Edit: Added graph on ""public order"" phrase frequency, 2008-2017; grammar





   

Thank you for doing this AMA for a community such as ours at r/india. You folks at the Internet Freedom Foundation have been doing some stellar work and it motivates me every day to do better for the society we live in. I have a few questions for all of you and I hope you can answer some if not all:

1. What is your opinion on the recent case filed in Delhi High Court seeking damages from the UIDAI for the leak?

2. Banks still insist on me submitting my Aadhar to open an account. Apart from not opening an account there what redressal so I have?

3.Why do you think Google recently preinstalled the helpline number of UIDAI on all our cellphones?

4. When does the grapevine expect the Aadhar judgment to be pronounced by the SC?

5. Has there been a large data leak in India that the general public is not aware of?

6. The appointments made to the Justice Srikrishna Committee on Data Privacy were said to be completely one sided favoring the corporates and datamarketeers. What do you feel we can do to make our voice more heard?

7. Do you think sophisticated data theft by Indian corporates will become more easy in the coming years due to the onslaught of AI? It may be difficult for consumers such as I to get access to such a sophisticated software to stop them.

8. Can we create an anonymous crowd sourced Privacy App (ACPA) to show us which developers sell our data and to what extent?

9. Mumbai currently has CCTV cameras with facial recognition present everywhere. How are they protecting my data under the archaic IT Act? What are they doing with my data? Who has access to the footage and how can I secure it?

10. Does Justice Srikrishna's new Data Protection Bill have a clause for whistle blowers or ethical hackers such as Edward Snowden or will someone who does something similar be left for the dogs? Heya! You guys are doing something really really important, please keep doing the good work and thank you.

My question is most people don't take privacy seriously, they just hand over any document they are asked for without even a single thought and this becomes even more worrisome in case of aadhar. I personally get in a agrument on weekly basis with people around me just for this.

How does one explain to them that this is dangerous and they shouldn't share anything with anyone just 'cause someone asks for it and especially not their aadhar number, what is the most logical and simplest agrument against not Sharing your information according to you.

And again Thank You, really we the citizens are indebted to your fight and cause. Hey Gautam Sir! Following you since your gold record days at Bangalore!... Big fan of yours. 
***
* Wish to know that how advisable is it to lock biometric details on the Aadhar website? 

* Also what is the case where non-government agencies ask for Aadhar details? Like banks or when couriers ask it for verification? Not giving them amounts to non-accessation of services so what's the alternative?

* Any provision for me to delete my aadhar details from the system or is it like lifetime liability which the govt. has handed us?

* Why is there no option on the UIDAI website to change the mobile number details?

* Why is google.com tracking me on every other website? Like reddit, facebook? How to shoo it away, although blocking it using the privacy badger makes sites non-functional at times.

* What is your advice you would like to give to your 20 year selves?

* What precautions do you take regd. online mass surveillance which happens. How to fight it?



Edit: For Apar; How have you automated deletion of your tweets after a month and why? What are your views on data localisation, both with respect to the Indian Privacy Code, as well as the Justice Srikrishna Committee report?  Thanks for AMA, Here are my questions:

1. Your bill defines personal data only to the extension of personal identification but what about the situations when a sample size is taken and it leads to identification but not the personal identification example google adds some are based on your data (shopping, browsing) and some are based on demographics (what indian people like, obsession with foreign brands). How we will be address that? 

2. As we already know, most of developing democracies have data protection law and authorities (though needs to be strengthen) but that don’t stop corporations from misusing it then how we will we able to stop them considering almost all the tech based are foreign funded and have big pockets. 

3. As in this internet age, if you are consuming something for free, then you yourself are the product – considering this, don’t you think convenience will always overshadow privacy barring few enlighten and rich souls?  

4. As all this EULA’s, T&C are lengthy legal jargon and people just accepts them – where the real privacy stays and how explicit consent is derived in these situations as this is almost like you have to accept it otherwise there is no alternative (even the law like EU’s GDPR is not able to simplify it)

5. Considering that the world is on the brink of fourth Industrial revolution and it will be fuelled by data, can we expect that in the upcoming time certain portion of personal data will defacto remain in public domain (name, DoB, banks account number, address etc) just like older days though now only certain clicks away. 

6. What about sting operations and mobile devices sending data for analytical purposes? 

7. Why can’t ne Aadhar number can be seen as indian replacement for Social Security number to avail basic services like phone number, bank accounts etc?

8. What tools do you guys use for privacy protection? Which phone, phone OS, laptop, laptop OS, internet browser and addons? 

9. Why not Constitutional status for Privacy commission in your bill, considering it is going to be new norm in upcoming time just like election and election commission?

10. No specific clause for Right to be forgotten in you bill which hits to the core of internet as they say you can't really delete once something is on internet?

 Not a relevant comment on an AMA, but can someone do a tldr or explain in layman terms what the judgement is about? What is the stand of IFF regarding CryptoCurrency usage in India?  What are your thoughts on Aadhar? Tysm for doing this AMA..

Many queries regarding current scenario, here are just a few

\->is the idea of ""finding the source of fake news"" feasible? It is like ""cut one head and 2 more shall take its place"" ...  how many will the govt. book!! too much too bring under control, shouldn't there be some other way?

\->has the govt. or civil soc. made any plans on how to curb this menace in the coming election year? I bet Whatsapp will be massively used for propagation and hoaxes.

\->the current idea of making internet giants place a server in India to curb fake news.. OK no problem.. what if govt uses this to curb dissenting, criticising voices. what are the checks and balances in that case?

\->why can't whatsapp have option of marking a ""particular msg"" as ""spam"". More the number of reports it gets on a particular msg, it can analyse and block its forwarding?

\->why cant user be asked for permission before he is added to any group?

&#x200B;

\-> your thoughts on the I&B Ministry team that monitors news channel for news on PM? Where do I get this SaveOurPrivacy sticker from? Are VPNs legal in India and if yes, which VPN would you recommend for Indian users? What would be a short and definitive response to the rhetoric ""I have nothing to hide. Why should I care about privacy""?  Given the advent of data protection laws such as GDPR in the western world how likely is it that a law with similar scope and emphasis on end-user data will be implemented in India?

Do you think the general public in India has little to no knowledge of the consequences of sharing their private data?

What is stopping Indian companies right now from using our data without consent? Which platform would you recommend if I am demanding/sending nudes to my gf?   
Snapchat/Facebook/Texting/Whatsapp?  What is with SC reserved judgement on Aadhaar? Is there any date given by when it will be released? I have been educating myself on privacy and how its important for me and no one is entitled to gain access to my personal information without my concent. I opted for these changes and need recommendation for what else can I do to be more secure with my information on internet.

* I switched to Firefox.
    Google chrome is a browser make for tracking individuals on the internet and when I founded it out, I immediatly switched to  firefox. Firefox provides tracker protection, I keep it to always ON and I combined it with a ad blocker (ublock origin).

* I switched default my search engine to **duckduckgo**.
  I have been using duckduckgo for a while now and it works like a charm (in the aspect of searches). I never felt the need to go back to google seach. I also use [duckduckgo extention](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/).

* I am also using a opensource password manager called [Keepass 2](https://keepass.info/).

**edit** - Here is another thing i wanted to ask.
I really want to use a VPN but I am unable to afford any so, is there some way that i can get a VPN for free. I know about [openVPN](https://openvpn.net/) but i think its complicated and will take far more time to master, still is there someone willing to teach me. How to use openvpn? I don't have any issues learning.   Hi

Your team is doing a yeoman service.
You deserve the support of every Indian.
r/antiaadhar activists are solidly behind you.

Questions:

1. Before his term ends, can the current CJI subvert the landmark privacy judgement and still push Aadhaar onto the Indian citizen?

2. Govt of Karnataka has enacted Aadhaar act in March 2018. In Karnataka, all govt departments are demanding Aadhaar by default - for property inheritance, for registration of sale deeds, issue of income certificate and much more. How can a citizen fight this?

3. Filing of writ petition (civil) is the only way to get courts to drill sense into over-enthusiastic babus who wrongly enforce Aadhaar for everything under the sun. Can Internet Freedom Foundation provide a platform wherein citizens can file class action suits & claim punitive damages?

Thank you Hi folks! Thanks for fighting the good fight! And sorry about the late questions.

Q 1 - What's your take on the various surveillance systems created by individual states?

Like 

1 - This in Punjab - https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/08/15/facial-recognition-ai-is-shaking-up-criminals-in-punjab-but-should-you-worry-too_a_23502796/

2 - The Aadhar connected surveillance system in Andhra Pradesh -

https://huffingtonpost.in/2018/07/23/how-andhra-pradesh-built-indias-first-police-state-using-aadhaar-and-a-census_a_23487838/

These two came to mind as of now, but I'm sure there's more. Is there anything that citizens can do against the State that seems hell bent on making its life easier at the expense of it's citizens?


Q 2 - What's your take on companies that sell tech that enable a surveillance state? (I'm mostly interested in the Indian context)

These include Amazon's Rekognition to the desi companies like Staqu (first link in this comment). Given that Western deployments of this sort of tech appears to disproportionately affect marginalised communities, it's almost certain that these tech deployments will target the already heavily oppressed communities in India.

What do you think about the ethics of selling such tech in India where they will be deployed without any sort of accountability or oversight or consultation with stakeholders (like every other surveillance system, I suppose)? 

Is there any check that can be applied to these companies or state/central governments, especially given that us citizens might not even know the full extent of the Indian surveillance state unless we get a major whistleblower? How do we balance the need for a surveillance state in order to ensure our security from external threats with the need to protect us citizens from potentially malicious actors within the state.


Once again, thanks for all your efforts and I apologise for the rambling nature of the questions :) Many thanks for the AMA.
A ""data protection bill"" is but a subset of a comprehensive privacy bill. Yet, even for this subset, I have not seen any movement in the ministry or cabinet and ultimately Parliament, other than the rather unsatisfactory Srikrishna committee report and draft bill being submitted to the IT minister.
So, basically my question is: While your Privacy code is a great effort, when and how will the rubber meet the road in Parliament? Also in this context, please share your opinion on Shashi Tharoor's bill. Thanks! Apple vs Google on Data Collection/ Privacy (incl. Selling of personal data) Looks like our gov is holding WhatsApp pay hostage to get access inside WhatsApp encryption, what's your thoughts on this.

https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/whatsapp-ceo-gets-indias-wish-list/article24747134.ece Hi,

Excuse me for being late.

I have two questions for [**Gautam Bhatia**](https://twitter.com/gautambhatia88) with respect to the Aadhaar case.

Supposing the really very powerful central government succeeds in convincing the 5-judge Constitution Bench to make having an Aadhaar number mandatory for everyone, is it the end of the road for the petitioners?

Or are there provisions to challenge the verdict of the 5-judge Constitution Bench further through the routes of review and curative petitions?

If so, is there a possibility that the petitioners will consider these options?

Thank you. What is your opinion on the carta blanche provided by srikrishna committee? State can run a virtual surveillance unit with that

What reforms do you suggest to make a layman aware about digital privacy, from a digitally skilled Bharat to a digitally literate Bharat?

Every time the question of aadhar jumps up, nandan nilekani comes with some nonsensical comment, like I will sell my data for services or etc. With the likes of momo game and blue whale being a menace, and literally zilch safeguards promised for data leakage via private operators and draconian provisos ""only uidai can file fir"" the government is trying to push everything below the blanket. What is your take on the uidai act?

Please do reply, a fellow civils aspirant writing mains next month. Your input can help me both academically as well as form an opinion. Hi! Don't really have a question but you guys are doing an absolute stellar job! So glad that you guys are pushing back on behalf of the civil society. An organization like ACLU is sorely missed in India and it's great that some very talented legal minds are filling the void.

Okay, maybe I have a question. I appreciate the difficulty of this one, but if one has problems with the Srikrishna Committee draft, preparing your own model law is definitely step 1. How do we get to step 2, which is ensuring that elements from the model law are actually taken note of by the government and do make it into a final law? Concerns about privacy and data protection are very niche, and I'm shocked and demoralized by how many very smart and well-read people don't give two hoots about it. The govt. doesn't seem very intent on holding collaborative discussions on privacy/data protection/aadhaar either. What's the next step, and how do we ensure that Indian Privacy Code does not remain merely a scholarly work? UIDAI - Hold my beer",AMA,2018-08-23 20:52:37

 Not an old randian, but wanted to know why is it grill and not girl?  Oh, that epic shitshow that was Priyanka Chopra's AMA. Poor PC had no idea that randia was not going to kiss her ass. She was asked questions that probably left her unsettled. What is up with Imran Khans alt thing?

What Priyanka Chopra thinks about Redditors and her AMA experience,241,2abdox,http://imgur.com/FqZuFPE,217,,srvijay," [deleted] Thanks for covering up the face and Twitter handle of the person who asked PC about the AMA...We will never be able to find out now.  People who have never heard about Reddit, like my office security guard , asked me yesterday what is Reddit? I was shocked.. I asked him, how are you aware of Reddit? He told that he had read on some hindi daily. We must thank her, for this publicity.  Current socioeconomic dynamics make celebrities seem a bit of a joke. Obviously, there's plenty of ""did it for the lulz"" folks who will ask questions just to piss someone off, but realistically, people are struggling all over the world. When some celebrity interacts with us in this context, one of ""Oh, hey! I'm just like you guys! See, I'm opening myself up to this human concept of 'conversation!' Ask me anything! Let's have a cup of chai together!"" It seems inherently as though someone is flaunting this gap. The simple fact that a celebrity takes a second to talk to normal folks throws their lavish lives into stark contrast. When they fail to deliver on some very fair, albeit hard questions, it becomes apparent that even in this blatant PR stunt there's no real human element present behind the persona. Can folks really be blamed for upping the vitriol in this context?


TL;DR: People in glass houses shouldn't do AMAs. [She will do it again](http://imgur.com/4u5DurS) The fact that people are willing to retweet and favourite each statement of hers, with no regard to content or meaning, tells you a lot about the people who inhabit twitter and the sort of questions you'll get there. ""Hey Pc,big fan,btw do you like anal?"" Ahh the beating the dead horse strategy, though I dont know if this will get you anything. Seriously, with all due respect, she should not crossover from Twitter/Facebook if she can't handle smart, real world questions.  Aww. How sad. :)  

[Link to said IAMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29nr3g/hello_im_priyanka_chopra_im_an_actress_and/) ROFL...says AMA, not prepared to answer. You keep using that word, cruel. I do not think it means what you think it means.   Yes the problem with celebs like her is that they think people will ask them all these cute/stupid questions as their fans.
I guess s*** got real and really quickly.

Think about if you were in her shoes and she was the redditor who was harassing you. You wouldn't like her doing it to you, would you? 

Exactly. 



 We should stop being interested in what vapid bollywood stars have to say about anything anyway. I should ask her a ""cruel"" question on twitter. /r/india's obsession with Bollywood continues.

Hi Reddit India. Am ready for my AMA,58,2wfcs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2wfcs8/hi_reddit_india_am_ready_for_my_ama/,276,,vicktalker," Who are you? Hello and welcome to Reddit India. Thnksr for the AMA.

My question is, how did you manage to land such big names for your debut film? Was it something you planned or did it just happen? Bollywood industry is said to be pretty tough to get in, how did you get in?
 This AMA is like fucking Jeopardy. Read the answer and try to guess the question! Should be fun are you high on something? I was there for the AIB Knockout. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Making your first movie is always tough. No matter if you have assisted before or not. Everyone has their own respective journeys. I've had mine. Yes, has been tough but no complaints at all.  [deleted] don't u think bollywood's standard is getting lower every year apart from some movies Thank you guys. The clock has turned 8. You guys have been kinder than I thought. Hope you had fun :)  How important is working with A-listers for you? Since this is your first AMA, you're supposed to reply to the original message. Just sayin'. Thanks for doing this AMA 

Being a lover of good cinema .

Why do you think Bollywood is going with grand budgets and less content ?  [deleted] Hi Vikramjit! Why was Arjun Rampal wearing a fedora the whole movie? You guys are being really kind. I was all set for a ROAST.  Roy.

Why? Can you get your cast to do an AMA? It's a story I wrote. And thought it would be a perfect first movie for me
 Banker to director, how did the transformation come about?

You’ve never assisted any director before. Was it tough?

Ranbir said that it's not his film. All well between the two of you?

Your connections with the Chopras is why you are in the movie biz?

It took you quite a lot of time to make your first movie. You made attempts in 2008 as well. Was it frustrating?

Roy hasn't done well at the BO. Some people even said it's painfully slow.
Do you think more popular names would have helped the movie do better?

 Jaqueline Fernandez and Arjun Rampal aren't really blockbusters actors.
What's the whole deal with Ranbir not promoting the movie?

Why was it set in Malaysia?

Why was there so much smoking shown in the movie? I've read all my reviews. Sense of humour about it all. I accept. Not necessarily agree but accept Somebody needs to tell Vicky how to comment on Reddit! How much you have to pay for good reviews ?

Some good movies like Baby get pathetic reviews while crap movies like Chennai Express get favourable reviews.  What goes on there ? The reviews have not been very kind. But everyone largely agreed on one point that your concept of a 'film-within-a-film' was unique. Is there anything that you disagree with all the reviews that came out for 'Roy'?  Sir, first of all hats off to have the guts to make such a movie in a country.like ours..not each of them.understands the element you presented..it was placid..tranquil Hey... Name is Vikramjit Singh Writer-Director ROY
 thank you wordswithmagic
 all the best for your board exams xepic. Do well. Hope the movie still running by the time you done. I didn't watch the movie after getting pretty bad feedback from friends as well as a [scathing review](http://ibnlive.in.com/news/roy-review-the-film-limps-lethargically-and-collapse-in-a-predictable-twist-ending/528307-47-84.html) by Rajeev Masand. However, that hasn't stopped it from picking up almost 40 crore in 6 days. Perhaps even more surprisingly Roy had one of the biggest openings in Pakistan! 

Do you believe that critics and a section of the audience were unfairly critical of the movie? Did they miss the point? Was there something that you believe you could have done better? What are your major learning experiences from your directorial debut? How did you decide the cast? [removed] Who are your favorite filmmakers and writers?  The Indian viewer is more sensible in recent times . 

Do you think bollywood should know that copying , logicless and cliched stuff infuriates the viewer (this gen) ?  What are your favorite movies? If given a chance, with whom would you like to work with the most?  Hey man, thanks for doing this AMA. What are your opinions on AIB Knockout? Do you think the issues has been blown really out of proportion? hello sir..tell about ur motivation for ur movie Hi Vikram, to me the most fascinating part is your story. It's remarkable about how you made the transition from a banker to direction. I find myself in a similar spot. I've always been interested in the indian film industry but have always told myself that it's stupid to make the shift. Couple of questions about your journey.

1). Before iBanking did you always have an interest in film-making (making perhaps short films etc).

2). How does a newcomer persuade stars such as Arjun and Jacqueline to star in their first film without any sort of backing? In a similar vein, how would you convince a big-league production house?

Thanks so much for doing this. Cheers. I just wanted to say that I am pleased that you have answered questions very patiently, and taken criticism very well.

All the best for your next movie Looking forward to seeing Badlapur this week. Big fan of Raghavan Welcome to Reddit India, Vikramjit.. Thanks for the AMA!  I was working in New York. Wanted to make movies so I quit and came back. Honestly, was a simple decision for me I got a question for a part I didn't understood in the movie? 

  If ranbir was a figment of imagination in arjun's mind then why did jack got frustrated after the painting theft moment and left arjun? Ranbir was in arjun's movie and couldn't have effected her mood.  Ohkay, first of all, I'm really looking forward to this movie but damn those board exams, I really hope it survives until my exams are finished. 

I'd like to ask how does it feel to work with a starcast you had? I mean if it's easy to work with them because they're already experienced or the shoot goes according to their mood?

P.S. I'm loving the ""Chitiya Kalaiya"" song. I've watched it more than 100 times on youtube cuz Jacqueline looks too damn cute in it.  [deleted] [removed] Hi Vicky. Thanks for doing this AMA. Haven't watched the movie after the reviews but thought the movie looked interesting and technically sound from the trailers. My questions:

 - Any plans for the next movie(s)?
 - Is Jacqueline as hot in person as she is on screen? [deleted] Don't you think that you took the suspense way to far? I mean the audience was so infuriated by the time the movie ended that they didn't cared about the twist in the movie ? Don't you think you went too far to create mystery that you ended up confusing the audience a lot more than that was required ? [removed] What is your take on aib controversy?  There is hardly any information about your journey in life. I am not sure if you have any industry connection, so how difficult or easy has it been so far? You can go for the jugular. You have my consent :) What are you working on currently? Will you collaborate with Ranbir once again for a big role perhaps? Not a typical question, but what did you have for breakfast?  your one lines are not helping much in this AMA. Tell us some interesting stories man. 

does jack have a boyfriend? is 23 your fav number? Ayesha is gf #23, Tia holds placard #23 while auctioning the painting and Grewal's house # is also 23.. I love bollywood movies, and I wanted to watch Roy as well, but almost everyone says it's a bad movie, so I haven't watched it yet. I have not seen even one positive review about Roy.

Can you tell me, in short, why I should watch this movie? Convince me, and I will go to the theater tomorrow and watch it.  Now! Yesterday only I shared the pick up strategy adapted by Rampal to start talking with Jacqueline.. that scene where she is reading a book! Awesome style.. did you ever try that in real life?  What are your views on the new censor board rules regarding ban on cuss words ? Who are you?  PROOF ? I am an aspiring script writer is there any way I could send you mine? You can not read it and throw it away if you please =) Are you blazing/blazed as you do this AmA? BC ho kya rha hai yahan pe [removed] Thanks for doing the AMA, I am sure it will be fun, as long as you stay honest with your answers and dont lose your head at the trolls

My question, What kind of planning you did when you decided to leave your job and pursue film making? Also how much time of your life was spent on Roy? 

Ninja Edit: Click on the reply button under my comment to reply to me. Similarly reply other questions To vikramjit

Do you give a fuck about reviews ? 
 Yes... All is well between Ranbir and me. We were aware of the deal. He stuck to his end. I stuck to mine. I obviously didn't pay my critics for favourable reviews. Not sure if you can buy them or not.  The fuck? What the fuck is he replying to? Can't make sense of shit.  Hi, Vikram I liked the music in Roy, why did you show Malaysian street singer sing 'Chittiyaan Kalaiyaan' in the scene?  Hi Vicky,

I was interested in Roy thinking it to be a cerebral, noir kind of movie.

To be frank, came back with a weird mix of feelings, something not too better than say watching a Khoobsoorat or that Sonam kapoor cindrella thing whatever it was.

So there, and I must say like your movie, you AMA announcement also took a while to sink in and figure out the outline and substance in a haphazard manner halfway thorough the interaction.

Well, question :

What are the key takeaways or learnings from Roy you've that you'd see yourself improving, or experimenting in coming project of yours  The movie looks really good but I found it to be dull and boring. Sorry! 

Newspapers suggest that the characters of Rampal and Fernandez were inspired from Quentin Tarantino and Sophia Coppola's real-life romance. Did they get it right?
 Thanks for doing the AMA.

So I haven't watched the movie yet. Tell me one reason why should I. Hey dont have a pressing question. Just want to say that your responses have pushed me to go and watch your movie. You seem to be sane person who experimented with his film and I appreciate that. And welcome to reddit! is this a troll ? mod ? verified ?  do you have to pay critics for a favourable review ? :D Just wanted to say I liked the movie. Different from the normal hindi stuff. Hope we get to see more of your stuff soon :)  SPOILER : Do you think Jacqueline telling Rampal as to why she left him came a bit late in the movie? Definitely made me go WTF. 

Also, what kind of a response are you getting from the audience who are watching the movie?  will you be making another movie? and why not? Someone point out to me who /u/vicktalker  is. :/

(Not much of a Bollywood fan, but mostly because less time, coz there are better stuff generally out there) Verification pic: http://i.imgur.com/cfEbyfR.jpg of Vikramjit Singh, Director of Roy Dude, who the hell is your PR guy? If he/she was the one who arranged this then fire their ass. There is absolutely no explanation on who you are or why you are here. Looking at the replies, Im guessing you have something to do with some movie called Roy. On the other hand if i am being a retard and not reading this properly , my bad.

Anyways so my question is are you aware your name is an amalgamation of 2 huge stars in tamil nadu and when are you going to exploit this by making a movie called Singh ? 

I mean think about it

Zomato CEO Asked The Internet To Ask Him Anything And Was Ripped Apart Within Hours,229,2yx5dr,http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/zomato-ceo-asked-the-internet-to-ask-him-anything-and-was-ripped-apart-within-hours-230959.html,119,,myjournoaccount," Indiatimes is now reddit with commentary?! Wow.

Anyways, I think Goyal got what he deserved. He came to r/india thinking this was a school trip where he would talk to the children, crack jokes and move on. Little did he know that this was like the Internet's locker room where you get honest feedback and sometimes lose your *chaddis* as well. Looks like he got our autographs on his ass on his way out. a rare instance of when the two warring sects of /r/india joined hands against a common enemy  What a fucking cunt! 

The way he handled those questions and made those comments was like it was an absolute honor for the redditors to be talking to him and asking those questions. 

On the other hand, I do realize why the app logo looks like a sperm, Mr. CEO. It's cuz you're a monumental dick of the first order. 

*CEO hoga apne Ghar main hoga, bhai. Reddit pe you're the same as each and everyone of us.*

Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger. Ye took my ""reddit gold"" virginity. Just wish it wasn't for ripping someone a new one.

Edit2: Also, /u/obvtrlacc I guess thanks are in order for you as well for the highlight and a pleasant surprise. Thanks, man.  This completely backfired for the guy. IMO, when he said about the tech team culture, he sounded like a 'don't like - don't work' kinda guy. Similar sentiment was shown by erstwhile reddit CEO Yishan Wong, on the thread of laying off an employee. Yishan went berserk and publicly humiliated him. Then came the reddit office shift and fappening. But from that verbal outburst on a former employee took a good chunk of reputation from Yishan's personality. 

Same thing happened yesterday with Zomato CEO.  It's official. The pitchforks are out. Deepi  goyal get in the queue behind piggi chops.

Now this is another post about indiatimes having a laugh at randians getting pissed off at DP's AMA, where randians are again getting pissed off at DP.


It's like 'inception' of piss-offing. I'm now getting pissed off at people posting about them getting pissed off about randians getting pissed off at DPs AMA.

Seeing the dissonance between reddit and the Indian mainstream I can't decide whether we are particularly enlightened or just a bunch of extra jaded angry outcasts.

LOL@ their naivete. /r/India going mainstream... me realizing I could have chosen a better handle... Take note, the article is from Indiatimes which is owned by Times Internet. TImes Internet competes with Zomato with its app Timescity. That disclosure would have been nice. [deleted] BTW, do you know that he is from IIT? 

 Honestly I didn't think his AMA was bad. Anybody expecting more than common sense answers from a entrepreneur needs a reality check.
Also it's ridiculous to expect Zomato to have a tech culture like Google or something. Its not in the tech business, its in the media business.
 mods pliss to tweet this tagging deepi and zomato. thenkz Never gonna use that app. I don't wanna be encouraging more dicks like him.  The app was as useless as his ama.Missed the opp to tell him I removed it long ago within hours of buying phone.

Whichever mod convinced this guy that AMA would be a good idea, did you have to apologise and stuff? deserved it ! I think this is a very appropriate headline.

Does anybody know of the research they are doing there? Would be pretty cool to have an AMA with anybody related.",saanisalive," Well, the Germans made this station for us.

Afaik Bharati is going to used for research on oceanography and continental drift, but the more interesting thing that I found out was the treaty that forbids countries from making territorial claims on continent is up for renewal in 2040, which is why China and India are building research stations to prepare some groundwork for future claims.

Haha, I like how everyone is accusing pro modi and anti modi users.

I for one think the whole thing is now in Jaitley's court! RR and Modi are chilled with each other, each doing their jobs. Jaitley was the one who needed a reduction in interest rates to increase the amount of money in the system to hit his targets. What's he going to do now. :3 [removed] [removed] Not to burst anyone's bubble, but he did also say, [""What we need to do is back up his visits with action on the ground.""](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1151001/jsp/frontpage/story_45574.jsp#.Vgz0q33SQng)  Guess we hate raghuram now Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan on Wednesday said that the government was doing a good job in managing the economy and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for being an ""articulate spokesperson for India"".

I dont care about the money India gets, I want the drama to be acted honestly. Can we request Mr. Modi for an AMA in /r/India ? Even Obama has interacted with redditors through AMA. I think it will be great if he can answer questions and share his views on different issues of the economy and society with us . [removed] Except when it comes to speaking out against Hindutva goons. Then he talks about lighting earthen diyas on Diwali and other stupid shit on his gaand ki baat [deleted] When did our PM ever have a communication problem? He is a great salesman. The only problem is following up with actions. There are some small steps(which are improving the economy) which any BJP PM could have done. As of today, our PM is the only one who can sell big reforms to the masses and he is not doing it.

> ""What we need to do is to back up his visits with action on the ground which reinforces the good impression that he has created,"" 

 Though I really liked Modi when elected, I am really concerned about the future of Muslims in India. I *did* bat for Modi and NOT for RSS, VHP, Bajrangdal and other numerous outfits that operate under its umbrella.

In recent times, I have studied lot of history and India has lessons to be learnt from them. Otherwise, we will be condemned to relearn them again at a very high cost. Importantly, religion MUST be confined to personal spaces - whatever fuck that religion is. Infact, I can condense everything into implementing universal code of conduct. I understand that it cannot be done in one step. But the general direction of our politics should be geared towards that.

Can /r/india form a pressure group to steer politicians, general society in that direction? I am sure many of us will lend a helping hand in such efforts. He should have just been a spokes person for the country not the PM who seems to lose his voice at the opportune moments!  [deleted]",AMA,2015-10-01 11:08:23
Peri vs Pony. The whole IIPM fake MBA school scandal in short.,133,4c8hwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4c8hwh/peri_vs_pony_the_whole_iipm_fake_mba_school/,41,"Yesterday, The Telegraph published an [article on the IIPM](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160327/jsp/7days/story_76563.jsp). It contains quotes from both Arindham Chaudhary (Pony) and Maheshwar Peri, the guy who published some articles about him, got censored, and sued. I am posting the quotes here and also other notable links. 

**Summary of events**

* June 2009: Career360, owned by Maheshwar Peri, published two articles: ""IIPM - Best only in claims"" and ""IIPM Makes Yet Another Claim - Over to you Mr. Sibal"". IIPM had said that its MBA/BBA course was recognised by the University of Buckingham, UK. Career360 got sued.
* 8 October 2010: Cases under Uttarakhand HC quashed.
* February 2011: Caravan published an article on IIPM: [Sweet Smell of Success](http://web.archive.org/web/20110130135253/http://caravanmagazine.in/Story.aspx?Storyid=717&StoryStyle=FullStory)
* February 2013: [Websites containing negative articles about IIPM censored](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/roausYEth9b0TvZv4r0whN/Govt-orders-blocking-of-IIPMrelated-URLs.html). 73 URLs blocked.  Peri and Pony appear in a [TV debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHCnxIPWAu8).

###Quotes

**Arindham Chaudhary (Pony)**

* *""There is an incredible conspiracy by people to pull me down.""*
* *""But IIPM doesn’t define my existence. I don’t earn my bread and butter from IIPM. IIPM is my passion.""* He has several other firms.
* On Modi, *""He has fabulous leadership qualities. I hate religion per se but I supported Modi openly.""* The Sunday Indian, edited by him, carried a cover-story about Rahul Gandhi in 2006 when it was launched. The recent re-launch issue carries a cover story about Modi. [Najma Heptulla](http://businesswireindia.com/news/news-details/power-brands-2016-launched-along-with-new-look-version-sunday-indian/47940) and some other BJP leaders were present at the relaunch.

**Maheshwar Peri**

* On why he didn't publicly announce his win, *""I didn't want the spotlight on me, or a larger-than-life projection. In fact, I wanted to contain myself.""*
* *""Financially, I had to spend in high eight figures. Personally, it did affect me. I will not lie. There were days when I couldn't sleep, days when I didn't have an idea how we would sustain the company, days when my wife and I discussed the shape our life was taking. But every time I met a young person cheated by IIPM, I felt that this was a battle I had to fight.""*
* *""In the five years after we started the battle, 12,000-15,000 students enrolled in IIPM courses had to go through the pain. I may have won the battle but, during this, thousands of students lost out. That's not a nice feeling.""*
* *""I knew that this house of cards would come crashing down if I kept up the fight.""*
* Peri has never met Pony but they used to text, *""There was communication between us. It wasn't that he was an enemy. But I was clear that there would be no settlement outside the court.""*
* On why he never settled, *""It is like Pakistan promising us that there will be no terrorism in Kashmir. Just give us Kashmir. Is that a compromise? There was no question of a settlement as there was nothing wrong on my side. In most cases, if there is a compromise, it means both sides are wrong in some way or the other. In my case, we had done nothing wrong.""*

http://pastebin.com/aR09KpMK Why is chaudhary's quote on modi relevant here again? What a title. Awesome job buddy. I used to track IIPM and Peri case sometime back and then lost interest in it, thanks for giving a summary.  Hahaha. Pony 2013. :D

Nice!! You get Upboats ~~sir~~ Saar! respect to peri peri. Spending such a large amount of money i hope he got compensated in some way  Related incident from 2005: http://indiauncut.blogspot.in/2005/10/question-of-principles.html [deleted] Not from IIPM. 

But there are a lot of institutes which are far worse than IIPM. I wonder why only this institute was targeted. The mba courses offered at most govt engg colleges (NIT's, state govt, etc; IIT mba is still better than most) are a joke.

In fact, I've heard that the teachers were highly paid and very qualified in iipm.

"Marrying my Japanese colleague, AMA.",306,8ef6pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ef6pj/marrying_my_japanese_colleague_ama/,235,"Long time lurker here, but today's been a great day for me so I thought I'll post the news here - I'm marrying my Japanese colleague after working together for 4 years. Our folks have finally met, and contrary to the usual drama one would expect, everything went well and our families are genuinely happy for us. We tie the knot by year end. 
 
Her father's English is fine, but her mother really doesn't speak the language (appreciate the effort though) - mostly unintelligible. Still, I translated where needed and filled in the blanks.

All the while waifu-to-be was a wee bit nervous with the whole interaction scene, but it turned out to be a lovely evening. They've traveled a long way and I was joking how the roles have reversed in contrast with traditional Indian norms where the prospect groom is expected to visit the bride and her family.
 
Mom had seen her photos on my Facebook, but was overly impressed with her skin and hair in person, to the point I had to ask her to tone it down a bit with the awkward complements. My dad and her dad got into conversations around food and a bunch of other stuff. 
 
I guess I'm writing this because it's a bit surreal how smooth everything has been. Her folks had zero issues with their daughter dating a gaijin, maybe because they knew where I worked, and my folks are just happy I didn't turn out to be gay (they had suspected so for a while on extremely silly grounds). Had it been an Indian partner, I don't think it would have been this straightforward.

Anyway, I'm tired and will crash, but feel free to ask me anything about Japan, work and life there, partners and dating etc.

Just want to make a note that we're very low-key, sober and laidback as a couple. She does not look like a dolled up AV model, I do not look like Tom Cruise's Indian cousin, and we're both quite career minded. So please don't ask questions like it's r/indiansgonewild.

Will answer starting morning. Cheers.",akimera," Where do you plan to settle down? Japan, India or somewhere else.  Do you watch anime subbed or dubbed? Does she like sakeru gummy or looong sakeru gummy? * How did you end up working in Japan?  

* Who is going to keep their maiden/birth name?   

* What's your visa status, and immigration/citizenship plans, if any?  

* Is Japanese work life really as bureaucratic and stressful as people claim it to be?  

* Do you think that people will stop treating you ""like a gaijin"", ever?  

* Are you proficient in Japanese? Is your fiancée proficient in English?  

* Are your coworkers and seniors fine with you two marrying?  

* Are you planning to start one of those vlog channels on YouTube where either the wife or the husband is a gaijin? (jk)  

 Congratulations Hey congrats. 
A Japanese lady at my university is married to an indian man. And they are doing great. 


I am sure by now you know that Japanese husbands hand over their salary to their wife, who in turn gives some monthly pocket money to the husband out of that money. What have you thought about it? 

Part of the reason I am asking this is I have a Japanese girlfriend too, whom i'd like to marry in future.

Congrats once again. [removed] This was a wonderfully heartwarming read. Congratulations OP! Wishing you happiness in your marriage.

I've read news reports about Japan's stressful work culture. Did you encounter this problem? How did you deal with it if you did?  Congratulations on getting hitched!

* Office romances are a controversial topic. How did the two of you manage to pull one off to the point of getting married to a person of a different race?

* Any rough patches in the relationship while you were working together?

* How did it affect your professional demeanor if you were working on the same project? You like hentai?  [deleted] Does the younger generation in Japan have the same work ethic as their elders? What do you think is the biggest difference between japanese and Indian youth? Japanese are notorious for their sense of cleanliness and aversion to smells. Did they get culture shock when the came to India? And did they complain about the perpetual curry smell. (disclaimer : my clothes have the curry smell too)  Well, congratulations bro. It's going to be an interesting and peaceful life. I wish you both a very happy married life. It's nice that it all feels so peaceful considering that most Indian weddings and parent meet ups are usually emotional roller coasters for the people getting married. It went down well because it was a ""gori chamdi"". Indians inherently look up to them. If OP by any chance fell in love with someone with a darker skin tone. The case may have been different.

I'm not saying your parents are racist but in general we Indians are one of the most racist bunch of people.  >Don't ask questions like it's r/indiansgonewild

Lol OP knows the crowd here very well.

How did you guys decide to marry, who made the first move?

Where will you settle, India or Japan? If India, how did she agree to it?


BTW, many congratulations. [deleted] Octopus: Food or Sex Toy? Omedetto Akimera san.  I too am married to a Japanese. I was actually not that much interested in Japan to start with. I spent a most of the late 1990s and and 2000s traveling and sometimes working in China, South East Asia and Korea. Met my Japanese wife because of our mutual interest in things Russian. The best hacks to get accepted in Japan - eat ika shiokara (fermented squid dish often acompanying alcohol), and depending on the region, natto (fermented soyabean), and yes, the ability of confidently walking into a public bath without a single piece of clothing. Oh curry is popular in Japan too, it is the national comfort food.  Are you intending to learn basic Japanese, so that u can converse with her mum? How hard is it to learn? Your post reminded me of an an Indian I met in Tokyo who lived in Japan for 20 years. He had married a Japanese woman long ago.

He and his Indian friends went to the same Indian restaurant every night and they talked in Indian languages.

When I asked him why does he come to restaurant everyday, he replied, because my wife can't cook. 
 Do you like ""Welcome To Japan"" by The strokes? Glad that you're marrying someone whom you love and know for so long. Happy for you guys! All the good questions have been asked, but just wanna say you're gonna have some good looking kids. Congrats on 3D waifu. What is a gaijin? Do you speak their language ? Where do you plan on settling ? Also, congrats on the good news !! Asking this because I am stuck in my assignment with this question:

Apart from anonymous bulletin boards, which social media platforms do you think the Japanese prefer where identity does not have to be anonymous (like Twitter/FB)

Really stuck, I have some nos from the internet, but needed a qualitative input as well.

Apart from that, congratulations and have a happy life!   >So please don't ask questions like it's r/indiansgonewild.

Kitna Dahej mil raha hai Bhai? Itna ki Sasura ka naati Ghar Jamai banne ko raaji ho gaya?🤔 she rove you rong time? what is the impression of Indian people in Japan?  Congratulations.  Wishing you a lifetime of love and happiness. Please expand on *""questions like it's r/indiansgonewild""*.

Anyway, which type of wedding will you have? I don't know which religion you're from so let's call it Indian wedding vs Shinto wedding? Congrats man, Post a picture of you two. 1.do you work in Japan?if so how has it been for you there?
2.any advice you can give for travelling through Japan?
3.how often do you meet a Japanese that can communicate in English?or is it absolutely necessary to have a decent knowledge on Japanese?



Always wanted to go to Japan one day...Hopefully it will come true in the future

Congratulations!! and all the best for you future Congratulations OP! Happy for you! :)  hi i am an Indian...i want to learn Japanese and work over there..can u please guide me how can i do it in minimum cost..as i have financial crunch Hope you will start with fixing their population problems. What about food? Does she like Indian food ? NOt related to your relationship, but i ha to ask.

What advice would you give to someone that wants to move to  Japan? What kind of jobs make it possible to do it? Should I be looking to do it by a certain age? After I get into that kind of job that will help me move, how do I actually have the connections to do it?

thanks Happy for you OPP 👍 Hey man, congratulations!! You sound really happy, and thank you for spreading some of that positivity around here. I thank for all the great people you have around yourself for making this happen, and you of course. Well done.

I hope to run Tokyo Marathon some day (lottery entry, not GFA). If I ever get selected, I will drop you a line. Best of luck mate, enjoy the new life!! > Mom had seen her photos on my Facebook, but was overly impressed with her skin and hair in person, to the point I had to ask her to tone it down a bit with the awkward complements. My dad and her dad got into conversations around food and a bunch of other stuff.

Fucking hate this shit. A Japanese friend (from the US) had come over once and mom kept talking about skin moisturizers and how they have jet black, strong hair without oil. 

Anywho - I have seen quite a few Indian-Japanese couples in my life. I think these work very well. Indian guys who have a sense of humor are strangely liberating to them, and the right mix between cultured and ""guy's guy"".

As a married man - basics are the same - keep her smiling, in the fight between the world and her - always, always, always - support her, never cheat, have fun together - especially before kids!

The hills around Kyoto and Uzumasa are so magical - sigh!. Enjoy you kids! OP I have read in some places that Japan has a similar caste system to India, where the people at the bottom being referred to as burakamin or eta. My question is how much of the attempts to eradicate these practices is part of the national debate in the mainstream media? How did you end up in Japan?  Congrats op. Now send some Yamazaki 18 for randia Is there any business opportunity for Indians / Foreigners or everyone just does jobs..? 1. How do I get a working holiday visa?
 Is it hard for indians? 

2. How's the market for non Japanese speaking             english teachers there.  Congratulations What kind of social life do you have there? Close friends from other countries?

How do you plan to take care of your parents when they get old?

What do you miss about India?


Congratulations btw!! • How can one end up working at Japanese firm from India any job portal or something available, from where one can apply ? 

• How is work life balance ? 

• How are Japanese people generally toward Indians ?

• Do people watch anime there like Indians watch saas bahu serials here  ? 

• Have you ever been to love hotels ?  Do You think that marrying a woman from another caste would have been more difficult than marrying a Japanese? Congrats OP. Can you post an update post about how's life in Japan for an Indian ? I want to visit Japan after few years :) *Omedeto Gozaimasu...* do you watch anime? What's gaijin ? She likes Goku or Vegeta ? Congrats good sir, wish you a happy married life. 
Kekkonshiki omedeto. 🎆🎇🎉🎌 gaijin? Congratulations :)  Japanese colleague? Why does randia do vehemently oppose workplace relationships. It does work out it seems. Congratulations OP.  How hard is it to move to Japan and settle over there? Any chance of working there as a veterinarian? Herro my name-u K chan desu. I-I f-feeru shy to ask b-but is she kawaii desu ka?  Congratulations OP. What's your JLPT level? Congrats on getting snared What an idea!
Let's pretend to be gay and our parents will become less controlling and less conservative. Ha whatever but thoda sushi bhej dena udhar se. What's with the public bath house in Japan? How can people just walk around naked like that?  You did it bro. Thats the ultimate
aim of r/india. Congrats OP. From your responses it seems like everything was smooth sailing. Makes me curious, what were the issues you guys had to work on before you could say you were ready for marriage?
 My wife loves Japan. she reads a lot of Murakami so her fascination with Japan is immense. May be one day, i will visit Japan and notice you and your wife and make a comment to my wife ""I wonder if that's the guy who posted on reddit about marrying his japanese gf"". My wife will probably make fun of me and life will go on. 

I wish you and your wife Happiness and health mate. Did you work on your Japanese language before moving? If so, how many months It took for you to understand and clear the exam.

BTW, Congrats bhai.. Congrats op.. Happy news for a change.. Best of luck to both of you on all of life's adventures.. Have no questing But I just leave this link here. Might help you. Their channel is awesome. Check their other videos too.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0reQCDL968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0reQCDL968) 1. India does not have dual citizenship. Nor does Japan. Which one are you/your kid gonna be? Do you have to renew you work visa every year? 

2. What do you think about the Japanese people in general (Which cultural/social norms push your buttons) 
 I know a friend who married a japanese girl. Everyone calls her a chinki in private and massage parlour wali. There is no respect for them in our culture sadly. OP, just wondering what age range you guys are? Late 20s? Early 30s? More about your career. You guys into IT or something else? why is it (almost) always desi men marrying other races but not the other way around ? (men of other races hooking up with desi women) OK would you elaborate on how you get the job (I know a friend referred you for a specialist post in coding/programming) and courage to move to japan?
And i heard japan is not immigrant friendly you case seems to be different? What are the best second-hand dealers to export a Japanese car? What is the procedure to follow to miminimize the costs and not get scammed? *If I was brides Dad I would ask

If not, surely, by next week because I got my master thesis presentation day after tomorrow (Yes, am also a student :D). ",dhruvrathee," Hi Dhruv!  
No questions. Just wanted to say that your Youtube channel is like an island of sanity in the digital sea of misinformation. It really separates truth from fiction for a lot of people.  

I suggest you to PLEASE make a video on [legalization of foreign funding retrospectively from 1976](https://twitter.com/Memeghnad/status/973815913014267904), and the mechanisms used by the BJP for passing it. The word needs to get out to more people.  
Best of luck! Do you talk about religious superstitions, homeopathy and general pseudoscience? We need more people who'll promote science in these times where pseudoscience is taking the front seat. If you don't tackle these type of issues, do you wish to do so in the future? when you make youtube video's do you think you are reaching an audience that is different from maybe those who hear soundcloud or read blogs? Just wanted to say one of my bhakt friends from Maheshwari community has become more rational ever since he started watching your videos. He is more receptive to you because he thinks you are from his caste/community. This may sound silly to a lot of urban and younger randians, but that's the truth for small town India and I think it would be an effective way to reach out to similarly conservative communities across the country. [deleted] what was ur inspiration to start doing what u do? Will you ever consider doing videos in English? I know your majority audience is hindi but consider making maybe one video in English once every one/two months and see how the response works out for you. I understand hindi with great difficulty but regularly follow your content because there is no other place where I can find this stuff in the form of video content. 

This year is going to be very interesting for Indian politics and you can really help making the public more informed about their government. Thanks for doing the AMA and creating the channel. Hey Dhruv, are you single? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Hi, couple of questions for you:

* Do you think the democratic process of voting for PM of India needs to be revamped? Would it be better if people voted directly for the PM,  à la presidential systems in western countries? If so, then should states contributing more to the national GDP be given more votes?


* Your thoughts on the upcoming 2019 elections? Also Where did the opposition falter and what does it need to fix to put up a fight in 2019?
 What are your hobbies apart from being a youtube activist?  Also, what are your future plans? Hi Dhruv, most of the people who have been brainwashed by RSS propaganda never accept any view other than they have been told over the years. Even if you give facts and good resources they still believe in WhatsApp forwards like Gandhi created Pakistan, Nehru was Muslim etc. What is your view on this and how to change their misbeliefs? Hey, Dhruv. I don't have any political agendas as of now, but I have a few questions. 

1. As an 18 year old, that as of now has no trust over either of the fronts(NDA and UPA) in the nation, what should he look for in the future? Are there any new emerging fronts that might deserve our trust? I just hope that Kejriwal gets more experience and trust and becomes THE leader for this nation, in next 5-10 years. 

2. AFAIK, people around me(mostly middle class) are not at all enthused or interested in the political circumstances of the country. They just want to be safe, and be happy. They have that 'chal rha hai toh chalne do, bas shanti se jeene do' attitude. I have that too. 

3. As an atheist and one that is critical of caste system(I was a born in a Brahmin family and none of us are castist), should I be fearful given that things are going backwards in the country, keeping in mind the future that has been planned out?
 In this period of ""sellout"" media you've been a much needed voice, keep up the good work Dhruv !! 

Edit: Thanks for doing this AMA too Have you done any video/articles where you praise sanghis or lambasted the Congress or the opposition ? I felt your interview with a AAP minister was too deferential. (Though I like the civility of it TBH).. So doubts can be raised about your impartiality that you don't hold all politicians to the same standard. 




Side note: I like the anti government stance here (except with seemingly random downvoting of BJP critical posts before some critical elections when IT cells have the funds to hire extra staff) but I don't want this place to become critical of BJP all the time (and by extension apologists for AAP/Congress) Will you be interested in making a video on corrupt practises in Delhi police? 
I might have some content.  Please read and make a video about Essar tapes. Everyone has forgotten about them because media didn't make an issue out of it.  I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kesk8WK1uWM) video of yours regarding bitcoin. Its probably the best explanation in hindi for a layman. But, why did u promote ZebPay in between? There are so many other good exchanges found at www.bitcoinrates.in, not to mention, www.LocalBitcoins.com is the best of them all, which is aligned with Bitcoin's ideology of decentralization. [deleted] I watched the IT cell video and wondered how come the IT cell doesn't target ur videos. I mean, the number of dislikes on Ur videos aren't as many as there should be because the IT cell seems so huge. This is a genuine doubt How you got hold of this it cell guy? Also I feel like you are little bit biased towards Congress. I'd prefer if you avoid it. It will discredit you.

 Are you not worried about getting rekt by this it cell? Also last thing. Can you plz put a ETH donation address here or on yt. Keep up the good work. Thanks

P.s. i am not paid to post this by hush hush party.

Edit- changed some words. Hey, thanks for the AMA. I found your channel after watching the unacademy videos that you were in and was surprised to see so many bhakts in the comment section.

So here are my questions. 

1. I know that you have made several videos on the propaganda news channels (the facts there cannot be more true), but can you tell me some printed news media that are unbiased that I can rely on for news without getting pasted by propaganda and pseudo development goals?

2. The most common question here. How do you deal with all the death threats and are you/your parents targeted/recognised in any way when you are in India?

3. Which political party do you think will be best for India 20 years down the line and what party will die out assuming that similar trends continues that are happening now?

4. While there are many ways but what is the best way I can trigger a bhakt?

5. Will you make videos on topics that are not political but deals with burning issues?

Randia thinks that your tweet about this ama can bring BJP IT cell here. I think they will be overwhelmed by the interface. Love your videos man. Goodluck with the presentation. Also, flair inspired by that video. hey, dhruv, do videos about the anti-vax propaganda which is gaining traction and my close friends believe Bill Gates created Ebola and Jews own all the banks in the world. Add English subtitles please, I cannot ask my friend to translate it every time. Please. And I hope you will make a video about the South of India too. Keep up the good work. Thank you. Your videos have lots of facts like newspaper articles etc.


How long does it take for fact finding and checking ? Hey! 

What do you think I can do as an individual to ensure that Democracy doesn't die in this nation? Or I am just a powerless person who will have to see the political structure of the nation collapse (god forbid if the time comes)? Hey Dhruv, thanks for doing an AMA. You are one of the few content creators in India that is creating admirable content for the Indian audience. Here are some of the questions I wanted to ask. Hope you can answer them all.

1.What inspired you to start Youtube channel? Do you always wanted to be a creator or the current state of affairs in the country motivated you?

2.Do you consider the present government better than the previous one? What is something BJP has done better than Congress?

3.What are your long-term plans regarding your channel?

4.Do you plan on hiring to grow your channel and pivot to other edutainment content like science, history, and stuff?

5.What are some of favorite Youtube channels?

6.Any advice for aspiring content creators?

Thanks Is there any Bhakth in your family or friend circle? If yes, how are they treating you once you started making videos! Are you associated with AAP ? Best of luck for the presentation dude 👍 * Hypothetically speaking (well it can happen for real too), if you are offered a large amount of money from BJP or any other party (lets ay Rs. 100 Crores) and asked to change your content. Would you do it?

(Because if I were Saheb, I would have tried my best to buy out people like you, Avi dandiya, Abhishek Mishra, Wali, and other influencers etc like they bought Arnub.)

* Do you think we normal people using Youtube would be enough to compete against well-funded media shops like Republic and TimesNow Hey thanks for doing this. I have seen your video where you highlight the shortcomings of an EVM. My question is that the guy who managed to hack it, why was he not present in the ""hackethon"" organised by the EC? This could have made the issue more mainstream. Secondly, what more can we do to make people more aware about the shortcomings of EVM? How do you prepare for your videos? What is your process? Hi 

I have been following you for quiet some time and people like you restore faith in people like us that not everyone is silent spectator.

My question would be , how do you see such ventures flourishing and what should be the future course. How people like us can fund such ventures and how we can help you propagate the message.

PS- I myself have couple of ideas around this , how to propagate real facts and news with authenticity and how to fund such activities. When I will have something concrete , I will let you and people like you know.  Hi Dhruv, I like your style of putting things across. You're articulate and thorough.

My question is : are you recognized on Streets of whichever city you're based in? Have you ever come across people pointing to you as 'that YouTube wala ladka'? 

Keep up the good work and be well.  I don't have anything to ask but looking forward to go through your response to each query later. Keep up the good work. Which is better congress or bjp? And why do you think so?

BJP having an IT cell was already a common knowledge. AAP and Congress to some extent also have these IT cells. What's your opinion on those? Will you be doing expose on them too?

Which party do you support?

How do i know that you're not affiliated with any party or baised? 

Should people believe the new internet based news outlets like the quint, wire etc. They're definitely baised? 

What's the positive things bjp have done in your opinion? People just let their biases run i believe in their decision.

Kinda disorderly, but hope you answer them.
 How much YouTube ad revenue do you get every month? Asking just out of curiosity, it is your choice whether to disclose it or not. What do you think does increasing custom duty tax every year really helps the Make in India initiative? It's really discouraging for us the tech enthusiasts since, we still have years to complete with other countries in terms of technology. Great work on the video. You are doing something most of us wish to do. All the best for your future videos. Do you think that EMV machines in India can be hacked or have already been hacked? If a Big political leader (Rahul,Kejri,Modi) calls you and offers you a Ticket to contest elections from their party will consider it?

In other words you love discussing politics on social media, but do you think you will ever get involved in politics going into the future? Who according to you will win the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections? What can you do to make people belive more in Humanity and less in religion. Because I believe that religion is biggest problem in front of the world. We need science, compassion and forward thinking in our life not jesus, ram or allah....... Have you ever considered making funny satire videos on Indian politics? Like what John Oliver/Stephen Colbert/Trevor Noah do in the US? Hi Dhruv,    
     
I like your work & keep it up.    
      
Your work is seen by millions & it is commendable. I would request you if you can highlight the issue of false/fake cases done by women on men to extort money. There is a thriving industry of 498A/DV/125 in India where married women & even educated ones file false cases on men & their families. The system works in ways to ensure the lady gets what she wants & the laws are biased. Since you bring out the truth in topics & that too with research, thought I 'd suggest you.  
       
This is just a suggestion & you are free to ignore & focus on issues you want to raise. No hard feelings.      i love your videos mate keep it up but can you make some videos on social issues like river,farmers ,infrastructure? i think you should go beyond politics and start new form of content.

2nd: i am skeptic so i tend to find your videos are sided towards other political party what will you do make more balanced videos? are you exposing other political parties as well anytime soon?

p.s.: have you ever got any thread calls or text(except internet)  Your interviews of Vinod Dua and Manish Sisodia were great ! Any plans on interviewing Arnab Goswami ? Do you regularly get threats from different organisations and/or people for your work? How do you deal with it? 

Adding to that, have you observed any increase in frequency of threats and abuse after your recent video? Have nothing to ask. Subscribed your channel. Thanks for doing good work. 😃 Hey Dhruv, fellow NRI here. I'm gonna start with a warm-up question, any plans to move back to India in long term?

(No sarcasm, I'm worried about your security and hope you have enough contacts) Damn bro good work! Finally I can unsubscribe all the news channels! Keep up the good work! Kudos :) No questions dude , just keep up your good work. You are an inspiration for Indian youth , who complain about things but don't do anything about it That so called BJP IT cell member you interviewed is actually a fan of INLD(main opposition party in BJP ruled Haryana) and his profile contains many posts about Jatt reservation demand which many say BJP is opposing. So my questions to you are...                                         1)How did you believe that the person is unbiased and reliable ?                   2)Do you support reservation system on basis of caste?               Why are you a supporter of Sadhguru and the river linking project even after the outright criticism?  Ok the more serious question: So many brilliant students during their school years due to improper training in higher order math and sciences become mediocre once they grow older. Many don't know of the proper exposure. Shouldn't the ideal case be when the students are taught according to their potential at their own pace?  Our performance in olympics and sports has also been pathetic, and nobody brings that up. What achievements have we really made ? There needs to be development in not only providing education to students, but also producing brilliant ones by letting them work in their own intellectual capacity, right? Hi Dhruv! Love your work!

How do you do your research?
Are you ok to join debate panels?
If money was not a constraint, what would you want to do?

What future do you see for Indian journalism and news based TV channels? Do you think other parties can do the same thing what BJP does. If  not, why? This question is regarding : 

* The quality of IT Cells of BJP. When I say quality you know what I mean.

* Bumping of people who remotely threatens them, like judges and journalists

* Not scary of vote bank politics.

* Screwing away people's freedom. Why don't you do a series of videos on Aadhar? There's so much to talk about. And everyone will identify with the issues as well. You should look at the arguments presented in court by the petitioners. They're available online.  hey Dhruv, what are your thoughts about the current education system? we strive towards perfection and we lose the creativity! Hi Dhruv, I'm your follower on Twitter since long. 

One question I want to ask - Did you forget to ask that ex-member of the BJP IT Cell whether his and others salaries were paid in cash or in cashless mode?

Some more questions: What's your system setup? Right from all types of hardware to software. 

And which pornstar you like the most? Can you add a sponsor button to your channel? Never knew you made this video: - [Dabangg 3 Official Leaked Teaser Trailer Feat. Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgan Fan-made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4en8ZCmixrE) A lots of travel videos too.

You are doing media's actual work. Keep the good work up.  I'm a researcher at a good place in India and I've been working on my podcast in science. Recorded a couple of episodes. What are some tips for better speaking skills when speaking for the public? How did you gain so good skills? I'd have to praise you, and you're a motivation. राठी भाई! राम राम!  
बढ़िया काम कर रहे हो| करते रहो! Do you think facebook also has a responsibility in not letting the parties' IT cells to have such control over their users ? I don't see anyone raising it in the public forum. Do you also have thoughts on making videos in English? Your content and recs are quite good! But I can't share them to my fellow friends as they don't know Hindi!  Mere Bhai, what you're doing is really commendable and people do need to be made aware of neutral news sources (if such a thing even exists)and unbiased media that don't lean very strongly towards one side or the other. My question to you is -why didn't you choose to stay anonymous? On Reddit , on YouTube or on other social media platforms. Watching your videos, it shows that you do your research and try to present facts. Do you think it was necessary for you to be recognized as a name with face? Or rather reveal your identity? Do you not think you could've gained credibility just through content. It's one of the reasons why I like Reddit or even twitch is because you say what you want while staying anonymous. Then people debate facts instead of attacking people personally (lol who am I kidding. That happens here as well). Additionally,  wouldn't staying anonymous ensure your safety and prevent you from getting death threats? How do you handle the troll attacks ? Till what level you indulge with them ? Please share one of your experience related to trolls  Are you proud to be an Indian or a little ashamed on the inside of being an Indian? Hey Dhruv! Big fan

BTW when is half life 3 coming out? Do you know about super commando Dhruva? Thank you, Dhruv for all your efforts. 

Your channel is a breath of fresh air in a country where all the ""news channels"" are shit shows. In one of your comments here, you said you don't support caste reservatoin. Can you elaborate? Like, Why don't you believe in it and what are your thoughts on the caste discrimination in India and how do you think society should tackle that, at all levels of the society? 

EDIT : Grammar. Thanks for doing this AMA Dhruv bhai,

Couple of questions here:

1.Have you have received any threats from the BJP IT Cell after the recent video?

2.Do you plan to do more such videos in the future?

3.There are some accusations that you do not present both sides of the situation and some of your videos are biased, what's your take on this?

4.Where do you live at present and do you plan to visit India?

5.Do you plan to make videos that are more general-do not involve politics or the government?

6.You recently made a block list against a powerful BJP supporting group on Twitter called HMP and they started sending you abusive DMs.What's your reaction on this and how do you plan to circulate this block list?

7.Do you plan to be more active on Reddit?

Thanks for answering all my questions and best of luck for the future!
 Hey Dhruv, thank you for doing this AMA.

Here are my questions:

1) How do you plan your videos and how long does it usually take to put one out?

2) With the current level of toxicity on social media, even for tweets that have nothing to do with politics - for instance, check out the replies to Shelia Rashid's tweet about Stephen Hawking from earlier today - how do you personally deal with the abuse that is flung at anyone speaking logic?

3) Have you been asked to take down your channel in exchange for money?

4) You mentioned you're a student, how do you manage to juggle hectic study schedules and social media, especially considering how toxic and personal the latter gets?

5) About your latest video, the IT Cell insider, how did you manage to get the story out - were you approached by him or did you reach out to acquaintences and manage to find a source?

Once again, thank you for doing this AMA, your videos are a beacon of sanity in these ridiculous times. We owe you one. i am a subscriber and I approve of your awesome efforts. How is your dating life after you have become a youtube star? Can we ask more than one?
 What are your thoughts on UP by-poll result ? Hi Dhruv! Congratulations on your incredible work on YouTube and taking out time to do what you're doing! I thought your interviews with Manish Sisodia, Vinod Dua and Shehzad Poonawalla were great! Wondering if we'll see more interviews in the near future and who that might be with? Thanks.

P.S. Good luck with your Thesis! Hey Dhruv, I like your videos. But in the political circuit, your videos generally come off as unisided and against the BJP government. While I have heard the word ""left wing propaganda"" associated with your videos, I do not agree as your content is full of facts and are well presented. I would like to hear your take on this. What is the most important story you have covered , according to you ? Next time i open or do any business in India. I will post it here to promote it. [deleted] Next question: Are you studying renewable energy engineering? Where are you studying it? What is the scope of doing this engineering and why do you personally like studying it? one off the note question : do you have a girlfriend/planning to marry?
:)) I am new to reddit. In fact it's my very first post. I have questions for both, Mr. Rathee and the community.

Question for Mr. Rathee : 
Have you ever considered putting your videos with Hindi (Devnagari) titles ?
This because i have surfed youtube in Hindi and found many propaganda videos with many views. 

Questions for the community 
1) Is anyone willing to share anti-propaganda videos ( with the consent of the creators ), under clickbait titles like "" jaaniye kaise..."", ""aapko yakeen nahi hoga..."" etc. etc. It is certainly beneath our dignity, but "" loha lohe ko kaat'ta hai"". I have therefore asked if someone is willing to or not. We all know how many views these clickbait titles garner.

2) Should we make another subreddit for discussing ways to fight off propaganda; like "" IndiaAgainstPropaganda""? There are too many people trying to create awareness but I feel that the vectors of their efforts cancel out in the long run. This is where the IT Cells beat us. Fewer people but organized and planned execution. A little contribution from many of us would go a long way. 
 What are the goals you've set for yourself to not get distracted? it's ok you can tell us :) Are you still there? How do you deal with the threats that you get from people whom you expose? Are you more comfortable with content in Hindi or in English? 1. Do you think the conservative versus liberal difference in Indian scene is same as in countries like USA? Or is it more nuanced?

2. Do you think slacktivism of the bhakt-kind is more effective than slacktivism of liberal crowd?


 How do you handle questions of your objectivity from friends, foes, and within yourself? Do you check yourself for bias, and how?   

Has/ve any political entity/ies approached you to shill for them? How did it go?   

What are your future career plans? Media or elsewhere?  What are some other YouTube channels like yours whose work you appreciate? And also of those who ypu don't appreciate because thry spread misinformation or are paid. Thank You. Amazing channel. Applause for your work..  I watched a few of your videos and please keep in mind I have nothing against you but you say stuff in a list like manner and I can never find sources on what you say in the description so whenever I have a doubt with what you say, I can never have it resolved easily. I guess this isn’t much of a question but a request. Pls source what you say in the description of your videos. 
Also a question, which party do you think can progress India forward, if any? If none, then which would be the least bad right now? Since you didn't answer my previous set of questions, I hope you will answer these:

1.What are your thoughts on Hindutva terrorism?

2.Why don't you make videos on Mudi kaka's past: Mansi Soni stalking, the murder of Haren Pandya,2002 Gujarat riots and the favours he gave to Ambani and Adani?

3.Why not make a comprehensive video on Mota bhai aka Amit Shah who is a encounter Specialist? If you do then please name the series as Mota bhai Morning walk special

4.Why don't you expose RSIS fake idealogues who apologized to the British such as sasta Savarkar?

5.Do you plan to interview Ravish anytime in the future?

 [deleted] Hi, Dhruv. Your frustration with misinformation is acutally shared by many, often times unconsciously. I see it as a glimmer of hope amongst the rotten media industry. How do you plan on staying independent? As we have seen globally that independent media sources hardly stay on the same course in the long run. I understand its not something that can be foreseen and one must adapt to continuously grow and be good at doing what they do. Where do you draw the line between having the resources to reach out to more people, not bringing a spoon to a knife fight( BJP IT vs Lone Wolf Youtuber ) and still staying independent?

How do you think we can bridge the gap between left and right? Which imo is one of the most constructive things we can do for a better and more aware democracy.

How do we make people understand that left and right are just umbrella terms and there is no stringency of uniformity in every opinion according to being left and right? Why cant we be more flexible and understand that one can be left socially and fiscally conservative? Also what is your opinion about the currently global rising issue of left vs liberal?

What are your views on Yogendra Yadav and Swaraj Party? He has come out to say that after trying alternative methods of bringing change for years, in his opinion the most literal way of directly participating in elections is the way forward.

What are 2 must read books in your opinion? And your favourite tv series if you see any?

This AMA is a great platform for interaction, bridging gaps and promoting awareness. What are your views on creating and encouraging an infrastructure where discussions, ability to gain different perspectives is given importance? As someone who is working on a project where technical topics are deconstructed and communicated to masses with aim to promote critical thinking and understanding, what would be your advice? I find it hard to explain to people that we can coexist with different perspectives as most of things in life are very subjective especially in politics.

I am not here often so wrote a lot of questions id like to know your opinion about. Also i am skipping office work to do this so please ignore the incoherent order of my questions! Feel free to answer any selected qquestions you might want to answer.

Thanks for doing everything you do! Cheers man! Lets hope what you do promotes activism amongst the youth. I am still bogged down by my practical limitations of having to study/work but what you do motivates me. Always. Hi Dhruv.
Do you consider this idea that Indian masses who follow propoganda are not gullible but many of them are manipulators themselves ,lesser you can say.percentage who are naive and falsely believes in propoganda are less. Benefit to less manipulators masses is caste superiority feeling or now days feeling of belonging to superior religion.
I have referred to the Dr George Simon's work.He has extensively worked in the field of manipulation,and I strongly feel it would help you immensely,he is indespensible to your work. 
Thanks I am not sure if you are the right person to do this (i.e if the material below fits your category), But you seem to be the right guy at this stage.


-I had some material on everyday superstitions like ""aaj shanivaar hai"",our calendar system our adherence to holy days etc, can you do a program on this?

-CHnages in our religious practices since Independence eg:growth of newer gods, newly Introduced practices, etc.

-An actual scientific study of population projections of India into 2050 and beyond.

-Religious conversions and growth/hype/scare of  other religious sects.

 What do you think about the GIFT city and DHOLERA (first smart city) projects in Gujarat? They haven't started work and a lot of people have already started investing in dreams?

I feel the smart city concept copies the West shamelessly. ( tall buildings, malls etc is their idea of development) Why dont they implement desi architecture?
For Example : Kyoto railway station, Japan. The station blends Japanese and modern architecture.

I think RaGa and PM work together for their cronies. What are your thoughts on this? (Have witnessed congress MLAs and BJP funders working together in my home state for major real estate and business deals)
Both have vested interests in each others' business.

What is your opinion about MNC regulatory bodies for salaried employees?  Have you linked your ADHAAR !!!! 
On serious note, what are your views on the BJP push for linking everything to ADHAAR. Hi, I am the Blocked user of Quora twice (paid price to write on current Politics).
1) Why your videos Majorly eccentric on Politics? There are many other serious issues to be addressed to. Will you cover those?
2) Why there is no interaction of you with Mr. Ravish or vice versa?
3) Off the track, what’s your star sign? When most countries today have uniform civil code, should India adopt it? Should state govts manage temple donations separately, or merge it with normal budget? Should minority schools enjoy privileges like exemption from RTE etc? Should Ram temple be built in Ayodhya disputed land, or Babri mosque, or both should be built there? Should rest of Indians continue not be allowed to buy land in J&K state? So I assume it’s a label you like to keep hidden unless required Please try to cover BJP's anti secular views and it's consequences like gaurakshaks. 
Really appreciate that you are trying to educate people about politics. Does pineapple deserve a spot on pizza? What , according to you are some Good and Reliable sources of news that you would recommend. Love your content BTW. Why do you block those who disagree with you? Hi, Dhruv for spreading awareness about these fake news channels and corrupted politicians. I like you, even more, when I read about your personal and professional life here. http://www.trendssea.com/2018/05/dhruv-rathee-wiki-age-dob-height-social.html

Just want to say to you. Keep up the good work. ok dhrub rathee its nice to see you on reddit , i know you are a youtuber who feeds internet with videos simplifying subjects . your subjective interest is Politics in india . so the first question i am asking:
1) what makes you qualified to do a political analysis on such a diverse nation?
2) why do you only make videos on single ideologies ?
3) your videos comparises of topic which impress certain group but why dont you show the real problem of india 
eg Burning distric of jharia , malnutrition , poor , UNEMPLOYEMENT  etc ..
the problem is my friend you just happens to know as much or less then any average internet user who can search .
indians are every 6 th guy on planet . Do some stuff which take our generation ahead , makes us worthy of what we take from world.......
Dont be that guy!!! Hey Dhruv. Thank you for the insights in government work you provided. What motivated you to make videos about exposing the government ? I'm a big fan :) What are you currently studying? Do you think staying out of India gives you a sense of security that you may lack in India?  1. What got you started?

2. What keeps you going?

Thanks for your work! [deleted] -What do you do for rozi roti other than youtube?

-What do you plan to do in the future? career wise? Full time youtuber?

-Why do this? What motivated you? On a debate like one on one with Arnab goswani, who would win?

With your association with Unacademy. How is the experience working with gaurav munjal (CEO) and are you guys associated with NMIMS. Would you consider doing Ur videos in English too to reach a broader audience? My only question to you

Why do you support Arvind Kejriwal? Doesn't that contradict your claim of being impartial?

I mean I get that BJP is corrupt to its core and not to be trusted anymore. But at the same time I pity those who thinks that Mr.Kejriwal is the answer. He isn't, he never was and he never will be, in fact he doesn't even know the question.

If Mr.Modi is arrogant and morally corrupt, Kejriwal is inefficient and just plain stupid. Recently I read a story About AAP indulging into cow politics. From your tweets and YT channel it seems you hold AAP  in higher regard compared to other political parties like BJP/congress, Any thoughts on this?

https://theprint.in/policy/cow-national-cattle-of-india-delhi-govt/40310/ Sir i heard exposing article for You in quora by ABHISHEK SINGH..but you taken down that article..is it true ??? And you are blocking everyone who are sharing that link ??? 
What do you think about Dhruv Rathee's interview of an ex-BJP IT cell member? by @Abhishek539 https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-Dhruv-Rathees-interview-of-an-ex-BJP-IT-cell-member/answer/Abhishek-Singh-951?share=9abc12a9&srid=5azz7 Hey, is there any reason why you aren't using this account u/Dhruv810 of yours? 1. Five things you appreciate about Modi government.

2. Your thoughts about dynastic politics. 

3. Do you take Kejriwal seriously, especially after Guptas getting into RS. 

4. Do you have a day job? 

5. Why not make videos on idiotic AAP and Congress bhakts as well?  Dhruv, are you a hindu? or an atheist? Dont give generalised answers like i m an indian/human first ! just answer whether you follow any religion ? if yes which faith is it? or u simply consider yourself an atheist?.Thankyou do you talk about population crisis in india 

or how sand mafia is destroyed people lands [deleted] [deleted]",AMA,2018-03-14 21:21:23
Would you guys like AMA from a successful blogger who was carpenter in 1997 in small area of Ahmedabad?,59,5i97sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5i97sg/would_you_guys_like_ama_from_a_successful_blogger/,16,"his flyer from the days when he was doing carpentery: http://imgur.com/a/DdLGU (from 1997)
His current blog: https://www.igeeksblog.com/ (Alexa 10k which is pretty good)

(I am posting this after discussing and getting proper permission from him)",techaddict0099," I think I would honestly be interested in an AMA with a carpenter than a tech news reporter.  Honestly, 'successful blogger' just sets off red flags for me as a pompous asshole.

I've interacted with a few of these and they just talk about themselves more than anything of use to anyone. I just googled a random set of words from the first article on the website and found this: http://m.imgur.com/VKEhkHP

Using Reddit India to get policy inputs for Parliament: Learnings from AMA with /u/tathagatasatpathy,138,2z6yrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2z6yrt/using_reddit_india_to_get_policy_inputs_for/,124,"[Wow. What a cracker of an AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2z493l/hello_rindia_i_am_tathagata_satpathy_member_of/)

Apart from the weed smoking and Pink Floyd referencing, I really enjoyed reading the questions and answers that you guys put forward. Thank you for that. And I must tell you that sir really enjoyed interacting with you.

Taking the conversation forward, I would like to hear your thoughts about how Reddit India can be used as a platform to get policy inputs for Parliament. 

To start with, I will try to get more [LAMP](http://lamp.prsindia.org/thefellowship) like me on board. Our parent organization, [PRS Legislative Research](http://www.prsindia.org/), can also be involved. I cannot give any guarantees here but I will try my best to convince 'influential people' to get on board. On a personal note, I will be putting up regular self-posts to get inputs from the Reddit Community for sir. He has approved of this and he said he will also try to participate in these discussions when time permits.

Do let me know what you think. I believe this could prove to be a game changer for public participation in policy.

EDIT: People please! Don't mean to be rude, but I didn't come here hunting for praise about my boss or me. I really want to hear your thoughts about how to formalize this initiative.
Once I get the inputs from this community, I can take the conversation forward with other people outside this forum. And I want make some headway before Parliament goes into recess.

Mods, please help me out here and give some ideas?

1) Can we have a special Policy section?

2) Flairs for people working in policy? 

I can't think of much because I haven't handled subreddits at all. Ideas please!

EDIT2: Aaand we made news! http://ibnlive.in.com/news/odisha-mp-conducts-a-reddit-ama-and-talks-about-the-government-pink-floyd-and-marijuana/534181-79.html

Brace yourself /r/India. Journalists are coming.",kumbhakaran," I liked when he replied why would you throw away your own state to a throwaway account. 

To me this confirmed that he is reading  everything carefully and giving his time to answer it.

Give a lal salam to your boss from my side.  Who would have thought a politician impresses reddit better than a film star (priyanka chopra) or a startup ceo (zomato). 

don't believe all the nonsense they say about what the 'youth' want. no one has any clue.  Will you use this /u/kumbhakaran or will you be anonymous? And what was Mr. Sathpathy's views on whole AMA, yesterday? Did he like this new platform?

>Reddit India can be used as a platform to get policy inputs for Parliament.

This could be our biggest achievement yet. Proud member of /r/india. Wow, missed the AMA, though i did post about applications to LAMP a few weeks back on r/india. Good to see this post. If you scan the non-political posts on this forum, some of the major policy intervention areas often discussed here are
1. Internet and Net neutrality
2. Sexual crimes including LGBT issues, harassment at work place, rapes and consequent legal and judicial rapes
3. Whiste-blower protection mechanisms in public institutions

I think this is a great medium to cut out the middlemen and connect with people and influence policy on issues which concern them most. Will watch this space closely. I think we should just stick with the current approach. AMAs and lurking. It is very risky for discussing policies that affect the masses through reddit. This is mainly due to the fact that it runs on votes that can be compromised easily. /r/india is a public place and with the attention we have been getting, it is quite easy for trolls or people with alternate agendas to score some points and in a sense promote themselves. Of course reddit has preventive measures but by the time we resolve issues like so the damage would have been done. It is great seeing such an initiative and like someone already said, who would have thought the government of all people would impress /r/india. I'm just being the devils advocate here. Before you jump in, have a sit down and think about the pros and cons of doing such things online and particularly on a large international website like reddit.

Edit: Holy cow I got gilded for this? In /r/india? Thank you, you thoughtful anonymous bastard for extending my gold to 13 months! I don't even.. I can't.. LITERALLY KAPPA TBH, I was more impressed with /r/India and it's mature questions. This speaks volumes about how if there are sensible answers, questions will also be sensible. Looking forward to more such interactions.  Let me tell you that guy(your boss) is very shmart. Made about perfect noise and won the Indians of the front page of internet.

Not sure where this will go, but seems like a fantastic idea. 

PS: Lot of people like me understand LAMP as web service solution stacks(linux,Apache ,MySQL and PHP) so thanks for including hyperlink. Great AMA man. That was an awesome session. he didn't reach my questions (To be honest, it was a HUGE one with many many questions so that probably contributed too). Still that was a good one. If he does this more, I'mma repost the same questions again. :p

#Keep on Keeping on. :)

PS

>Don't be surprised if you find me as a regular Redditor after this. Amen!

Shit he might reach the porn subreddits soon enough. o_O
And warn him that people on /r/worldnews  are pitchforking faggots. (far more than usual as in) People please! Don't mean to be rude, but I didn't come here hunting for praise about my boss or me. I really want to hear your thoughts about how to formalize this initiative. 

Once I get the inputs from this community, I can take the conversation forward with other people outside this forum. And I want make some headway before Parliament goes into recess. 

Mods, please help me out here and give some ideas? 

1) Can we have a special **Policy** section? 

2) Flairs for people working in policy? 
I can't think of much because I haven't handled subreddits at all. Ideas please!  he completely changed my perception of the BJD If this is still on, I would like to share my 2 cents.

Please create forums online to discuss policies (not necessarily on reddit). This will go a long way in understanding what the general sentiment of the public is.

You can also consider a formal process to review policies like ISO reviews global standards using SMEs and volunteers.  If you need inputs on any policy you should create a thread asking about it. Or put some sorta blue print so we can discuss about it. Reddit India is a great platform for debating issues where people from various political ideologies are constantly at war. So you can get to hear various points and counterpoints.  First of all, I think we need an AMA from you. 

I have seen a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcG047EbuPs) about Swaniti Intitiative which if i am correct is similar to LAMP. 

What you guys are doing is simply great and what we need. I always believed that the politicians we have today, many of those have the will to find solutions to many problems this country has but they dont have any skills required to do that.  Thank you for considering using Reddit India as a way to get information on what type of policy young people are looking for. I think its a very good idea and this is an excellent way to get data on what people on this subreddit want to see happen in the country, on the central level at least. Perhaps there should be a mechanism which could allow you to direct to help them if their enquiries do not relate to the central level but to the state level as well? If people feel they can reach the politicians, the politicians will feel that they have to do work and will be under pressure to do something, in the very least.  > Apart from the weed smoking

Despite that being the highest voted question and answer in the thread. Speaks a lot about your conviction in democracy.  Although having a special policy section is a good long term idea, I think it would be quite difficult to have regular engagement there as reddit is still not that popular in India. But I think there can be special policy discussions here on a regular basis where you can take one issue at a time and get someone who has good hold of that issue.  kumbhkaran ji,

your sir ji, didn't ""answered"" my question, I asked a valid question, please to tell me why? Hi there, if I may say, this community is concerned with few policies than the rest. In no particular order, 

1) 66A - IT act

2) Net neutrality 

3) whistle-blower protection act 

4) Complete implementation of Justice Verma report on rape and sexual assault issues. Some input from that report have been implemented but not all and not the most important ones, like marital sex and all. I haven't read the report entirely, it is some 600+ pages long. 

Of the top of my head, this is what comes to my mind. Hi, thanks for a fantastic AMA. offtopic, why do you call him as ""sir""? Did he got knighted by the British monarchy? ",AMA,2015-03-16 10:55:25

As a 47 yo myself, I remember we had Bush. I hope you followed cricket at that time. You must have been 18 when Kapil Dev's team won the world-cup. How was your experience following the tournament? Radio and Newspapers?  
You must have been a school student then. When did you hear about emergency? What do you remember about it? Did the people had the same ""euphoria"" for Congress as people today have for BJP?  [deleted] What are the products which have remained consistently good in quality from the time you remember using it for the first time? Could be anything. If you had any advice to give us, what would you say?  
I remember the emergency, India Gandhi's assassination, Rajiv Gandhi assassination and so on. Something related to railway   
How was the railway travel experience in 1970s. you had a girlfriend? Any advice you would like to give to a person in early 20's

Does family(relatives) matter with age. Because I am not in contact with almost all of them, and there are many many relatives some of whom i dont even know. when do you plan to retire? What do you expect your retired life to be like? Is it different from what you want? 1. Where have you traveled and what's your favorite among those places? Future travel plans?

2. If its not too offensive, your religious orientation and how it changed as you aged?

3. Craziest thing you've done in your teens/ young adult phase?

2. What kind of investments have you been able to do? Cool username!

How did to handled your failures?

At any point of time you thought of emigrating? (not on my mind though)

As expectation of every generation changes, how you tried to deal with it? Like rebelling from your parents to your kids being rebel?

Thanks for this thread /u/astraman Your thoughts on going childfree.

2) Your hobbies which withstood the test of time?

3) Do you attend stag parties (touring - men only)?
 What do you think of Indias/world's space programs? For a second I thought it was 1996. And i was gonna ask that where did you get this great idea from.  did you ever happen to be in goa during the hippie culture? did people know about the psychedelic scene emerging in goa? how do you feel looking at the modernization happening around you in the name of development. Beautiful land being brazen and lots of buildings and malls being constructed in its place? How do you feel about the weather change that happened due to all these construction?

He is articulate,aggressive and to the point. Thanks a lot mods.

If we are just going to ask low ball questions, then its going to be on us. Hope he is made aware of the kind of brutal honesty that's appreciated here. Tell him what happened with Priyanka Chopra and Deepinder Goyal. That's not how AMA should go. Silly questions, silly answers, agreed. But serious questions, one better take them seriously, or randians will rule. That's the constituency I belong to! **My humble request to everyone in 4reddit**

He is a politician. Please reddit, behave yourself. Ask decent questions and keep the discussion civil. I don't ask about *toothpaste flavor* or something. Please think before you type. Awesome work guys.

https://imgur.com/a/eEMZN3G

My Twitter: https://twitter.com/bhatiamanu

P.S.: This is a throwaway",intraday_trader," Bhai, say something basic about where to start. All the full time traders I have seen till date feels like rely on luck. More than half the times their calls fail. 

What strategies do you use as an intraday trader? What patterns/charts/tools do you people use? 

I relatively have learnt about how stoploss becomes an important factor. That 1 big profitable trade can beat 10 small triggered stoplosses.
But I have difficulty in selecting stocks for derivatives intraday. And also predicting the pattern.

Edit: have burnt around 50k in options last year in 2 months. That's quite an outstanding performance IMO. Congrats on that.

1. Do you ever indulge in Derivative trading. If Yes, what would you prefer Stock Derivatives, or Index Derivatives ? 

2. Have you ever hedged your positions through options ? Like using a protective put strategy  ?

3. How much do you rely on quantitative analysis, and how much on intuition ? Have you ever performed regression testing or used Quantitative models like EWMA ?

4. What role do you think Fundamentals \(ie. Reported balance sheet figures\) lay on Intraday  trading, and have you ever bet on high volatility events such as Budget Day or Announcing of Quarterly Results ?

5. What parameters do you set while exiting a transaction \(eg. Exit after a max of 5&#37; Profit or 5&#37; Loss\) ?

6.  Which would you place an intraday bet on ? A small cap stock, Midcap stock or a bluechip one ? I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.

Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.

Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over $1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would have been won.

By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably write books on “How I turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet, they’ll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors with, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”

By then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much the same — 215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips. what is your daily/weekly profit target ?

how many trades do you do in a day ?

what exactly do u use in technical tool for entry & exits ?  (like MACD Stoch Oscill 
 or other?) 

What is your daily loss limit ?

do you trade from home ?

how much tax you pay for intra day profits ?

you said volatility is important - what technical indicator you use for it ?

do you track open positions in F&O markets for profit booking and longs unwinding  scenarios ?

Which day of the week has is most volatile for equities ? do you use automated trading based on python ? For how long you have been trading ? my dad told me this is like 'gambling' how accurate is that?
if you hit the jackpot or you loose everything How much spread do you encounter when making obvious bets (like pc jewellers tanking on arrest of Md)  What do you use to back-test your strategies and execute your strategies?  Should I learn coding to be a successful trader? I have a RSI+MACD+AO strategy, that works really good for high leverage intraday. But I am either too drunk, or unfocused to bother constantly looking at the charts. Amateur trader here. First of all, thank you for this ama. 

You mentioned you use price action to trade. How do you use back testing with this? Because the way I use price action is rather 'fluid' and is based on the way I read the market at the moment. If you don't mind, can you give a brief outline of your backtesting methodology? Also, where do you get the data for testing? Thanks.  are bhai AMA banake kidar MR.INDIA jaise gayab ho gaya? Laal chasma lagau kya  [deleted] i just saw your tweet you made 2.5 lakhs last friday? and your net for the year is 30 lakhs.
seems your returns might be pretty volatile. what's the max drawdown you saw this year?

do you know your sharpe ratio or some other reward/risk number? off topic, but are you eligible to get large loans like home loan etc? i heard traders find it hard to convey banks for loans. is that true? Can you give an example of one stock and couple of it's trades that you did successfully? OP thanks for having the AMA.

Thanks for demystifying trading.

I thought no one can trade for a living in the age of algo trades.

I would love to interact with you if you were to teach beginners.

 I find trading to be very emotinal process.

**On a bad trading day, when you hit daily stop limit.**

What do you do that day to process this negative emotion ? [deleted] What are your thoughts on the general conensus that day trading is pretty much gambling? 

At what point can you differential between the two?

 Do you need a license to be a retail trader in India like they do in the UK? 

If you are only limited by your capital, do you still find yourself investing in companies from India? If yes, why?

I know these are so many questions but I am actually very interested in trading. I'm building up capital right now to be able to start low time. Any help would be amazing! And congratulations on the successful year :) 
 OH man. Money I lost day in trading went to OP's account. Paisa waapis karo bhaiyya :D Have you done Certified Financial Technician (CFTe) / Chartered Market Technician (CMT) ? do you plan to train students for trading ? cfa or frm certifications help a trader ? you trade only equities or do you trade forex/metals etc too ? 
 could u share more please ? I want to get into trading on daily basis . Would really appreciate if u shed some light on basic strategies. Dont need spoon feeding just some basics should be cool.  [deleted] why do you prefer Sharekhan to Zerodha? Your thoughts on the crypto market? and/or where do you think this whole crypto fad is leading to?  I'm an absolute beginner in trading, can you please suggest which books or material I should study as per you. I'm not asking the shortest way here, just want to know how you would have approached trading given a chance to start all over.

 As someone that is about to become an intraday trader, I'd like to ask you how do you deal with the loneliness? I love the money, but I hate having no one around. How good is your social life? Are there any regular careers for day traders, where you get to work in an organisation and trade? How did you start your career, how do you find people in this circle. Fuck, I have so many questions and no one to really answer em! Are you doing Algo-trading? How can i become a trader like you? i have burned 1.25 lakh in nifty options and made around the same.  What about tax?

Since trading is a business activity, would you say it's better to register a separate business, and trade from that account?

What tax structure would you recommend someone who has long term investments and interested in intraday trading? Because you cannot register as a trader and change it to investor in subsequent financial years. Congratulations! For some this gains might seem too good to be true but I can personally vouch that such gains are possible. I am new to the game (1.5 years) and I have a few questions for you, please answer them sincerely. Also, I'll give my methodologies for comparison and you're free to give suggestions on improving them.


1) How do you find scripts to trade on intraday basis? I personally use zerodha's trade API to detect high volume stocks within seconds and then apply my strategy. Whole thing is coded in python.


2) What is your strategy when your trades start taking losses? I gradually reduce my capital allocation as my consecutive trades become loss making. For example I'll give 100% percent allocation to my first trade, if it ends in a loss, I'll allocate only 50% of capital in the next trade, and then next will be at 25% allocation and so on. This way, for my entire capital, I won't lose more than 2 x stop loss% I have decided. (in case you're curious, 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + .. = 2)


3) What's your daily news routine? I personally prefer CNBC TV18 + economic times print edition.


4) Do you think your strategy worked more because of the bull run and the positive sentiment in the last FY? What signals do you use for trading? Your methodogy? On what size candlesticks? Please share. 

Zerodha has partnered with some company Streak for algo trading. I would like to create one and backtest it. So please share your methods. :)  Hi! Congratulations for devising such successful trading strategies.  
I noticed that on a total turnover of about 195 crores, you have earned a profit of around 16 lakhs, which comes out to about 0.082% of profit margin. I think it is very low unless brokerage charges are negligible.  
How much brokerage rate is charged to you by Sharekhan?  
 1. Do you restrict your stocks to NIFTY 100/Nifty 200 ?'

2. How do you pick the stock, do you decide it at end of the day or using some screening method during market hours ?

3. When you just started, how long did it take before you actually started making considerable profit, or should I say, how long you kept making losses  Hi, Congratulations again. I went through all the comments. I still have couple of questions. 

1) Do we really need a system while trading with just price action? Especially when one can read his emotions such as FOMO, fear of losing money made or fear of losing what you have etc... If a proper system is required, why do you think so?

2) You said you mostly trade in equities (rather than equity futures). What is your position size? To get the returns you are showing, you need a large position size. How is it possible to move in and out with such large position size? Do you scale into your position on intra day basis? How do you handle slippages for such large position sizes with stop loss orders?

3) Have you migrated to futures from equity? If so, did you make any changes to the systems you had for equities?

4) Also you said you have documented rules for entry (and I really liked your description of a hypothesis in terms of %raise in 15 mins and the slope of consecutive highs and lows) but you manually manage entries. And also you said you will enter and exit 10 trades a day on average (Also I got to see from your twitter images that you have many trading stocks each day against multiple trades in a single stock). How can you manually monitor that many stocks?

5) I have documented few hypotheses (I got the term hypothesis from George Soros book of Alchemy) myself and I am confident that these hypotheses will evolve into great systems if fine-tuned little bit and followed religiously. I am in a dilemma about why we should follow systems at all when I can get >1% trades without any systems on any day. Please let me know your perspective. 

Thanks in advance from a fellow
PriceActionVolume trader in the making.  do you use technical analysis or fundamental analysis ? Most of such claims are just an advertisement to join their classes which will teach to to trade. Classes costs somewhere between 10K - 25K.
They promise to make you so good, that you'll be able to get back all your fees in 1 month! ELI5 [deleted] [deleted]",AMA,2018-05-06 18:55:40

>In his mind during AMA he must be like ""i'm nailing this AMA as I'm speaking in favour of our kulcha and kountry and army"" just as Rahul Gandhi was feeling during his interview with arnab ""I'm nailing it as i'm speaking about women empowerment, RTI and candidate selection"". He got the taste of his own medicine today.

Many of us may be interested to know how his life has been affected by the ongoing drama and see things from his perspective. I personally want to ask if things got significantly better after witnesses came forward. 

Also, any news site that might possibly pick up from his AMA could potentially bring more awareness on the whole situation from his viewpoint. ",putin_putin_putin," Cool Idea.You can try contacting him on FB.His account is easily searchable.

I did try but it got in his 'other folder' cos no mutual friends. Cool

Good idea. 
 TBH i dont think an AMA from him will be THAT good. There are about 5-10 questions one can ask him. It might be better to encourage him to write a detailed article, giving his side of the story, how his life was and how its become etc. 

 In fact I'd like Jasleen to also have an AMA. Let both their accounts be subjected to our scrutiny. Let's see who cracks. From their TV appearances I can already guess who. Arnab has found Saravjeet guilty and OP has found him innocent.  We are a country of a billion judges, zero investigators. not a bad idea . this would help to bring out details of the impact on a normal guys life due to false allegation and dramatic sensationalization by media.  Lets give him consolation party also huh? No - Not an useful way to even waste your time. Asking questions to Saravjeet (and may be Jasleen) ... LOL. It is a good idea...i have got questions related to the events that transpired that night. And how to curb the women who are trying to use their gender and other things for favors and privileges Serious thought, they should do a face-off on Google Hangout (Live on Youtube, with few ground rules like no abusing, no harassment). Check out this video

",kumbhakaran," What do petitioners seek to achieve?

1. A formidable data protection law?
2. Making current Aadhaar Act more robust?
3. Ensuring the implementation of 'voluntary enrolment' section of the act?
4. Doing away with the use of biometric?
5. Dismantling whole Aadhaar infrastructure?
6. Something else?

Edit : This question has been ignored, despite being decently upvoted. Clarifying, that this is not a troll/rhetoric question. The question seeks to understand, what is the way forward. Each one of you can please reply individually. I have had the experience of living in a State where they had a dictatorship. The id card was a weapon used by the state to deny people their rights. If you didn't have an id you did not exist. The State actively denied id to people of certain demographics who they knew were generally against the state. Then there were things like the police were authorised to stop anyone and demand an id, if you were unfortunate not to have one, you were at their mercy.

My question is, how far are we from such a reality?

Secondly going by the Government's arguments in court about owning personal biometrics, is it not possible that the government may in the future decide to include dna as an additional biometric?  Since many of us here have been following and opposing aadhaar from its very beginning , I think we are now at the cusp of its final road where it could go either way.. so my question in general is 

1.) If the judgement does in comes favor of the petitioners , and aadhaar is scarped , or limited , what would be the govt`s reaction ? can they make new pillars through parliament to strengthen it?

2.) If the judgement comes in favor of govt , what should be our next course of action ? I for one and many here and on other forums havent enrolled for aadhaar , so should be our next move , still wait out or enroll after SC judgement?

Thanks in advance for your participation here on reddit . To the lawyers on the panel:

If there is proof that a citizen's Aadhar number is leaked (by govt website or other means); can the citizen disown the Aadhar number like other IDs and names/surnames via the affidavit route? 

i.e. Can I file an affidavit that my Aadhar number so-and-so is leaked and not to be trusted for any further transaction. Put advt in two national papers and be done with it?
 On a recent trip, I witnessed large scale collection of fingerprints in a temple premises for free food - the reason given was to prevent the same person availing the benefit multiple times for each slot. As far as I know, there are no laws in place that makes the fingerprint collection illegal.

If they were collecting raw fingerprint data, and UIDAI somehow had access to that, they could match that with the hashes they have, and illegally build a raw fingerprint database linked to people's identities, which could be misused at scale with horrific consequences.

In all the discussions of Aadhaar related privacy issues I've seen so far, no one has raised the issue of private players collecting fingerprints from masses and selling it to corrupt officials at UIDAI, who could use the Aadhaar database to build a raw biometrics database that could be used to target citizens at will.

Would you please raise this issue as well? Also, could you petition to stop the ongoing fingerprint collection at the temple? Unless I'm mistaken, it happens everyday, and it's quite a popular temple.

Video of incident: https://streamable.com/i8l9t We live in a country of where more than half the population do not have permanent address. Aadhar does not allow us to change addresses easily? So, what shall I do, not move? If my house owner asks me to move shall I quote Aadhar as the reason for not shifting?

We live in a country where connectivity is at the best 50% or less reliable. The service provided by the telecom providers are so bad, that we need to have multiple phone numbers so that we can have a connected when necessity arises. So, what do I do? Should I put up with bad connectivity and bad customer service because I have recorded this phone against my Aadhar? Say, my mobile got stolen, what do I do? Because it is against my Aadhar, I have to go complain, get an FIR and make sure the telecom provider either disables and gives me another SIM with the same phone number? How do I prevent misuse of my phone now? So, basically while in the past I could have just said ""forget it"" it is just a loss of 10K, now I find myself in a position where it is a huge loss, waste of time and effort and making sure I prove that I did not do something wrong? Say I got another phone with a different number, how do I change my phone number? It is a myth that address and phone numbers on Aadhar can be changed. I know of people who are already struggling to do this!!!

We live in a country where more than half the population has to do manual labor to survive, which means finger prints do not get retained over a period of years that is what we are talking about, not just one year and two years!! We are talking over a life time. Over that period of time I get cuts over my finger, I get burns, things get smudged, I have accidents, fingerprints are bound to change. So, what shall I do? Are we suggesting I cannot live a carefree life because I have enrolled in Aadhar? I have to ensure my finger print stays, so another thing I ensure does not happen?

What is the means of identifying a person at all? Address changes, phones change, fingerprints are non-reliable. DNA? So, how do we get a fast recognizing DNA machine? What is the reliable form of identification that can be automated in the real-time that is required here? None of these have been thought about!!! The environmental factors have not been considered to ensure over a period of 40+ years the same identity can be maintained and proved!!! Who has studied fingerprints to ensure nothing changes because of the heat or the dryness of the air, the pollution in the air? Yet, this is being linked to all my life savings, insurances, investments and so on everything that I have been doing to ensure a good retirement?

So, in the end, the way I see Aadhar: There will definitely come a time when I cannot prove my identity since all forms of identification used in Aadhar is not permanent, I would have linked all my life savings to this form of identification hence all my life work has been wasted and what really has happened is a person who had all the hacking skills was able to just breeze in and use my life savings to live a better life and I who tried to make life better got the worst end of it, because my government told me that all my hard work was worth nothing because I could not prove the 12 digit number that I am quoting belongs to me!!! Strange life!!! Thank you so much all for doing this AMA.

I usually have a problem explaining to my friends why Aadhaar is big deal. The general mentality I've encountered is that it doesn't matter and privacy is dead in the modern age anyway. Could you give a plausible negative scenario or two that I could use as an example to explain to them about why we should be concerned. Most people I've talked to don't care about the leaks at all. If I could tell them how exactly it could affect us, that would help raise awareness at whatever level I can.

Thanks again for fighting the system on this and doing what you're doing. You're all very helpful to people like me.  My question is to [/u/jackerhack](https://www.reddit.com/u/jackerhack), [/u/prasanna_s](https://www.reddit.com/u/prasanna_s), [/u/thejeshgn](https://www.reddit.com/u/thejeshgn) and [/u/iam_anandv](https://www.reddit.com/u/iam_anandv):

Many security researchers like [fs0c131y](https://twitter.com/fs0c131y) and [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/is-indias-aadhaar-system-really-hack-proof-assessing-a-publicly-observable-security-posture) have found out several vulnerabilities with the mAdhaar app and the uidai website. In spite of all this, neither the website nor the app has been updated. Why is the organisation so ignorant of these critical issues? I'm a journalism student interested in Aadhaar (full disclosure: most of you know who I am) and there are some pretty basic questions I have that I'll direct at whoever I think is best equipped to answer.

**To Reetika Khera:**

What is *the* largest fundamental failure Aadhaar has resulted in PDS? Without going into privacy concerns, has distribution of entitlements improved in any way at all from the pre-Aadhaar era?

**To Anand V:**

Why is the UIDAI so inept at handling architectural vulnerabilities and security holes? Is it mostly fixable oversight or irreversible negligence? What is, from a tech POV, the largest failure in Aadhaar that you think exists?

**To Chinmayi:**

What are some things the UIDAI can do to bake privacy more deeply into how Aadhaar works? What, in your opinion, are the major flaws in the Aadhaar Act and the major flaws in its implementation?

**To Prasanna:**

What concerns you most about the ongoing Aadhaar hearings, especially with the government's arguments and some misconceptions the justices might have?

**To Kiran:**

What, in your opinion, is the single biggest security flaw with Aadhaar that *can be easily fixed* but is not being fixed with the UIDAI.

**To anyone:**

What would you personally start with as a foundation in your criticism of Aadhaar? I see a lot of really tangential issues being discussed in-depth on Twitter, so how would you describe the core of your objection to Aadhaar as a project?

---

Thank you all for doing this, by the way! [deleted] Thanks for doing this AMA, and for all the work you folks are doing on Aadhar. 

I have a question, probably best directed to /u/prasanna_s but for anyone else who knows the answer, too. 

What exactly is the role that the Vidhi Center for Legal Policy is playing in this case? Are they government-funded or just engaged by the government to deal with this matter? 
 Hey guys just wanted to simply thank for standing against this monstrosity! 

I have seen some of you in interviews / debates on RSTv, Ndtv, TheWire etc. It's been a pleasure to your thoughts/ ideas.

 [deleted] Khosla Lab has Aadhaar Bridge as it's part [1].
Vinod Khosla is US Citizen and come under US laws[2]. 
Does not it make clear that US Govt can access to all Aadhaar data in legal way too ?

[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla
 Should I bother getting an Aadhaar card made or no? How to make make  common people to understand how bad aadhaar is. No matter what we say they are ready to do what govt asks and trust it completely . I even got mocked for being overactive for not getting aadhaar. Hii,

Do we have conclusive details on what is the technology stack of the main Aadhaar database? The one which UIDAI claims to be un-hackable.

MongoDB keeps coming up in my searches. If its MongoDB; its a terrible choice. A google search with ""mongodb is shit"" will list out the reasons. Those posts are not by newbies but by experienced engineers who understand databases. I say it with confidence as I have burnt my hands because of mongodb; in a top technology company. I can share links which have done technical evaluation; if it helps. It can be un-hackable but its definitely unreliable.

Can we share technical feedback with UIDAI? Not as individuals but through a platform preferably pseudonymously. Sharing feedback individually results in name calling by the BKMJ team which I would like to avoid. If not, are efforts being made in the supreme court to make that a possibility?

My worry is; we are spending hundreds of crores of rupees every year to maintain a system which can fail any day. Is it worth your and my hard earned tax rupees?

I despise the Aadhaar project but the reality is Identity is a problem worth solving and although Aadhaar (in its current avatar) is completely useless; we need a solution. In general; we need a system for public to give suggestion to the government on the technical aspects. I understand; they had hired Nandan Nilekani for that purpose but he never ran a technology company; he ran digital sweat shops and doesn't understand product development/technology. We have many people in the technology ecosystem of our country who could contribute and who want to contribute towards this national system but there is no process and we end up with a white elephant system which keeps swallowing up our monies.

This public feedback system needs to be for all government projects. Can/Will it be argued in the current Aadhaar case or will they has to be a different case/PIL for that to happen. Is there a way to reach out to the Aadhaar folks if we find flaws / bugs in UIDAI services (without being FIRed)? I do not mean tweeting directly like the fsociety guy.

Also, I read about Estonia having a kind of identity system with decentralized storage of data i.e each center which needs/uses the ID system stores its own data. What are your thoughts on this? It is not enough to fight aadhar. Other use of biometrics have to be identified and stopped. Don't we have right to refuse to use fingerprints for attendence and authentication in offices? 

For a large infrastructure project say 100 crores, for payment there is only one time authentication and whole money is paid. For ration of one week which only costs rs. 100 people have to authenticate every time. I believe this is humiliation of the poor, and they need to resist it. The poor should insist that they will give fingerprint only at the time of creation of the card.  Question directed to no particular individual on the panel (answer from any one is appreciated): 
What exactly is the legal requirement of mandatory ""Aadhaar-Bank Account linkage"" (by 31/3, unless SC comes to the rescue)? To elaborate: Since I have no faith in AePS (good ole NEFT and Credit cards are good enough for me) can I ask the bank to merely keep my Aadhaar No. as part of my KYC record and not make it visible to UPI?
PS. Thanks all for this AMA! To anyone:

What is the recourse for an individual in case there is a data breach and his credentials are stolen?

If SC rules that Aadhar is not mandatory, is there an option for an individual to de-link his Aadhar?

Are there any current mechanisms where we can prevent Aadhar data sharing or at least regulate who can view it? I have nothing to hide. Why should you have any problem?

This is something which I have been asked multiple times since I have been peddling privacy. This is my understanding/argument.

Without privacy, there is surveillance. Most people have nothing to hide so it should not be a problem.

Sure! But we live in a democracy (thank goodness!), and if the ruling party has the power of surveillance, they are always one step ahead of the opposition. They are aware of every move the opposition party or a individual is going to make. This makes the ruling party indisputable. Democracy goes down the drain.

So the question is not whether you have something to hide or not but rather if you believe in democracy or autocracy.

Thoughts? **To all**:

Why don't you all work with [EFF](http://eff.org) and the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org) and seek their help to buttress your arguments against Aadhaar and to enhance our privacy laws? Hi thanks for AMA
Initially the Govt , told : To Avail Subsidy on the domestic gas , we need to link Aadhaar , then they have withdrawn the subsidy claiming the income bracket. 

Isn’t it cheating the citizens to comply ?   Anjali Bharadwaj  , having read your articles on rti , lokpal bills , why isn't enough noise being made in the media and the judiciary when lokpal has been in lurch for several years and rti act has been significantly used to muzzle out any dissent (last I remember was whistle blower needing to give only rti info amendment) brick by brick (if I may borrow Jaitleys's words) , the institutional edifice of the nation is being scuttled at its birth. 
What is the agenda for future? How do you propose we come out of this situation and build stronger institutions?

Reetika Khera , Recent death of a girl in  jharkhand has been hushed and the aadhar to nfsa has been on upswing. Unfortunately even the best minds like Aravind subrahmanian neglect these issues and give thumbs up for something as draconian as fingerprints for ration . With DBT ,state is effectively becoming night watchman when it needs to strengthen health and education . My question is why is NFSA being so poorly implemented when the right to food it gave has been strong on paper. How better can it be effective on ground since it's state govt rather than union which implement it. 

Thanks. There are many well-meaning people (incl. The Madras and Chhattisgarh High Courts) who honestly believe that the ""Aadhaar Card"" is some magic technology that is fool-proof for identification/authentication/authorization. On the other hand, the reality is that  Aadhaar is a faulty technology with a badly compromised ecosystem. Given that in this day and age, debate means: hardening your viewpoint and launching ad-hominem attacks"", isn't it better to just focus on: NO mandatory Aadhaar for anything and simple opt-out process? (Let those who think that it is a great technology, use it voluntarily).
 [deleted] I used to believe, rejecting Aadhaar is an act of luxury. I am a student and I am depended on scholarships.
I am from a coolie worker background. Anything - ranging from fertilizers to food ration, Aadhaar is imposed on me and my family. We are unable to deny it. So, Basically the project is dividing the nation into two. one with aadhaar - the pooor and one without - The luxurious one. 
Baba Saheb designed our constitution nobody should not discriminated or differentially treated based on their identity. In the digital age, it is happening. 

I used to believe Aadhaar is a US prop. After recent [depression]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008 ), banking sector need to get stabilized and they created a plan for expansion. They achieved exponential momentum when new government came into power. That is why the Tughlaqan transformations in the banking sector. is that correct ? ( well, Its my guess )

National crime rate is finding new heights. How to address the violence introduced by illegal migrants from the subcontinent ?
(or if the Aadhaar consortium fakes some data and tell SC - that they were able to reduce crime rate just by introducing this project ) Initially, Aadhaar were  designed for everybody including migrants, tourists, natives. why that policy change ?
You people, criticizing the project should bring up some alternatives. So, What is your suggestion ? Please don't tell me what Sunil Abraham and his team says. How is Appelbum's idea ? 
BTW, why we have those much documents to verify my identity to the state ? 
 A question, copy-pasted from the AMA announcement two days ago.

I once listened to Sunil Abraham who said that the best way to beat the surveillance threat of Aadhaar is to make your own information - biometric and demographic - publicly available. That way, you could always maintain deniability if someone stole your identity. In the case of Aadhaar today, would you think this is a practical idea and a smart thing to do?

[The idea was that if your identity info is supposedly unique, accessible only by you, then, if (or, more realistically, when) someone else steals your identity for some nefarious activites, you will be accused legally. Given that they have your identity, supposedly accessible only by you, leaving tracks, now the burden of proof would fall on you to prove that it wasn't you... Which might get very difficult. On the other hand, if you make your biometrics publicly available (which is not illegal), then, you can immediately argue that it wasn't you. The burden of proof would then be on the accuser to prove that it was really you using your identity. It's like using the guy fawkes mask... Or printing a mask of your own face and everyone wearing it.]

I'm glad this is 'live' for a couple of days! I thought I'll miss it.

Thanks! Question to /u/saikd : As per the existing Aadhaar data infrastructure, what all information does UIDAI possess? Mr. Ajay Bhushan Pandey said that they don't have bank A/C number, they just authenticate a linking request. How could this be used for surveillance? @/u/jackerhack 

I read your article on ""[Why the government is insisting on linking your aadhaar with mobile](https://medium.com/karana/decoding-the-push-to-link-aadhaar-with-mobile-numbers-and-bank-accounts-d2fd15d78ae9)"" and shared it among my circle of friends and relatives. I didn't understand your points fully but one of my friends pointed out that this happened because Aadhaar was designed **before Smartphones became ubiquitous** and what we are seeing is retro-fitting measures. 

##**Is that it?**


Also, every time there is a discussion on Aadhaar, I am asked to present **all the scenarios** of exactly how Aadhaar will be misused. When I fail to do so, it is assumed that my failure of imagination proves Aadhaar's safety. 

##**Is there a compilation of such scary scenarios?** Let's say worst come to worst and SC upholds Aadhaar's constitutional validity. Will that nullify its previous judgments regarding it being voluntary? While linking Aadhaar to various services is metastasizing, SC *has* previously ruled that no one could be compelled to get the UID. Yet, these services ignore the directive and make it compulsory for us to enroll into Aadhaar. Isn't that contempt of the court? Is there any legal challenge regarding that? Thanks for doing this AMA! 1. Can the Aadhaar in its current form - biometrics and OTP to authenticate a widely distributed number be saved? Where saved means operable without threat to individual and national security and rights.

2. How can alert citizens help challenge the damage done by Aadhaar? Are there specific actionable steps?

3. Are there other laws that can be used by citizens to protect their rights? For example even if misuse of Aadhaar cannot be challenged legally because only UIDAI retains the right, can the PDS be sued for causing starvation and deaths by denying citizens their entitlements or can a bank be sued for exposing sensitive information of clients by forcing them to link Aadhaar before it was mandatory? Or can a telecom company be sued for any OTP related breach if they had intimidated customers with threats of disconnection to obtain the Aadhaar number linked to a SIM that any of their service centers could duplicate? How can I explain to a common man, including poor or illiterate that surveillance is bad for democracy and for them too and it does nothing to prevent terrorist attacks? To anyone:

What will be the economical impact of scrapping Aadhaar?  What measures UIDAI has taken to prevent corruption at Adhaar registration centres ? . Some private contractor companies are looting the uneducated folks who pay way more than the actual fees and it is quite common in small towns and cities.   Thanks for the AMA. To all of you: While the UIDAI is planting ads and generally going on a blitz in the newspapers, I would like to see if there is anyway of a rebuttal that is equally as public as the ads in the newspaper. Are we doing anything about it? If yes, where can I sign up to donate? If no, why not?

Have all the members in parliament taken an aadhaar card? Any idea if there are dissenters inside? 1. Has any independent / third party security audits done on the Aadhaar project?

2. What are pros / cons and other views on open sourcing the Aadhaar project? (to help find and fix bugs easily by hundreds of people).  Thanks for doing this AMA! As a programmer, it's surprising that UIDAI's practices and norms haven't set off red flags for anyone involved in the Indian IT industry.

Would a more decentralized identification system be viable as far as concerns about information security and privacy are concerned? Limiting government authority is a good way to preserve civil liberties, and an Aadhar system developed along the lines of federalism might be a step towards that. The recent narrative of Supreme Court on people being okay with sharing info with private companies but not with the governance system like Aadhaar. How much water does that hold? My bank, Life insurance, Health Insurance, Mutual funds, Web Hosting, Mobile network provider are asking me to add Aadhar to my account. 

What can be done in this case? Will bank really block access to my account? **Question to all**
Many allegations have been made of *foreign hands behind the aadhaar project.* Please enlighten me which are these organisations and the international lobbies? As per Aadhaar act, only UIDAI can file an FIR for Aadhaar related crimes, is that true? If so, what exactly is and isn't covered under UIDAI's discretion? Would you completely remove Aadhar or just change a few parts about it (eg. : replace biometrics with smart card) ?  

 Is this AMA still ongoing? Thanks for answering our questions. 

My question is for /u/Saikd - do you think Aadhar poses a credible risk to national security? I am thinking in terms of this recent article read about the possibility of tracking jawans using their aadhar cards. 

https://cjp.org.in/aadhaar-puts-bulls-eye-on-every-jawaans-back/ I won't write a long paragraph. My simple question is, in case SC rules against the petitioners, what would be the recourse for a common citizen who doesn't want to be a slave at the mercy of an Orwellian state. Most of the arguments in court on Aadhar has been about ""Right to life(Privacy)"" 
There is a sufficiently strong argument based on ""Right to freedom"" as well, Why has no one raised it in court. e.g.
 freedom of movement, by requiring Aadhar for travel isnt this right curtailed, and moving forward by requiring fasttag(Aadhar for cars)

freedom to practice any profession. If I need Aadhar to register my firm, open a bank account register for taxes etc... Isnt my freedom curtailed?  Can aadhaar-linkage reveal and clampdown my PirateBay Visits? Hi! 

On the Israeli PM's recent visit to India, there were talks of cyber security partnership between the two countries.
(https://thewire.in/155950/india-israel-cyber-security-partnership)

Could some interplay between AADHAR and the stated cyber security schemes lead to national security issues? thank you for the AMA, folks. Thanks for also doing things in the real world.

I have a question, if you are still answering. Is there a way to find out the names of all the people who have been associated [even fleetingly] with this project from the start? 

I vaguely recall a link in this thread, i'll go look for it next.

Thank you again. Thanks for the AMA guys. 

If the Aadhar is to be wholly scrapped, what would be the loss incurred on the exchequer?

Also, what are the remedies available to the stolen identity? I’m referring the sale of identity for ₹500 that was recently in the news. 

P.S. can you guys also ask Stupidosaur from Twitter. He is hell bent on #Destroytheaadhar tag.  To anybody, but in particular the legal experts:

A. Does the draft Srikrishna committee report have recommendations that will get rid of the following two aspects of Aadhaar as it now stands:
1. Only UIDAI (and not the affected individual) can file a case against somebody for misusing their Aadhaar number and information.
2. UIDAI can unilaterally deactivate an Aadhaar number without adequate notice (and opportunity to respond) to the affected individual.
or
B. Can we hope for the SC to get rid of these odious aspects of Aadhaar as it now stands (in the unfortunate event that mandatory Aadhaar is upheld by the SC).

It seems to me that  ""Right to Privacy"" should include the principle that a person is always the final owner of their personal/bodily information even if they share it with specific people for a specific purpose for a specific period of time. Hence the question. Thank you. Couple of questions :-

1) From all the aadhaar data that has been leaked,what could I glean now, considering that UIDAI is considering the virtual aadhaar number thing (basically where you can generate a virtual aadhaar number which isn't your actual number, or what-have-you?)

2) Lets say, all my aadhaar data is now public domain, minus the biometric data. How can somebody mis-use it? Also, other than the aadhaar lock thing? Is there any other way of protecting my aadhaar data?

3) In the company that I work in, we are quite heavy consumers of the APIs provided by Khosla labs. Other than the fact, that their APIs give 500 far way more often than I'd like, and their error codes don't really seem to reflect general industry standards; from a security perspective, it doesn't really seem too bad. Am I missing something here?

4) If you could design a proof of Id thing that would work online and offline, what would its features look like (preferably in detail). [deleted] Thanks for the AMA, question to anyone on the panel.

The newly appointed CEC seems to favour linking Aadhar to Voter IDs. 

Given the current security loopholes and vulnerability - how easy would it be for voting fraud to be possible? It's a twin sided argument though. 

1. Is there any possible way an integration in the EVM chain would render voting fraud impossible. 

2. If possible, can the potential fallout of the vulnerability be loss of voting choice anonymity?
 **To all**:  

Now that even corporates have started making representation in courts about the need for Aadhaar, will your arguments in the Aadhaar case include [Surveillance Capitalism](https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/)? For u/chinmayiarun
The argument that Aadhaar leads to surveillance is based on the fact that Aadhaar has the metadata about the various activities which I transact. If the Aadhaar infrastructure receives information only when it authenticates my card, says when Aadhaar authenticates my bank account when I am seeding it. Then it receives information only to the extent of my bank account and not what the transactions I am using the bank account for.
How does that lead to surveillance? To Anjali Bharadwaj
Are the policies governing #Aadhaar in the best interest of #TheCommonMan? What does Aadhar fix , which can not be addressed  ,by online verification of multiple points of identity documents like Passport,PAN Card,etc ? Is one of the issue, the non-digitisation of records and is Aadhar is seen as a blanket solution to it ?

Thanks for the AMA. Question to /u/reetikak : I am aware that government has shown savings from low oil prices, as savings achieved due to LPG DBT. I am aware that government's claim of savings in MGNREGA is mainly due to exclusion of poor.
 
* Government's exaggerations aside, what could be the ballpark savings that Aadhaar has brought to exchequer, plugging leakages? To Saikat Dutta:

Ultimately, isn't Aadhar the consequence of a vast welfare state? Milton Friedman had stated that a country cannot simultaneously be open to migrants and have a large welfare infrastructure. One of the initial motivations for Aadhar was to keep a check on so-called ""illegal immigrants"", and to stop welfare fraud. Is a look at the Indian welfare state also needed  in order to further protect privacy and civil liberties? To /u/chinmayiarun, /u/atnixxin or /u/jackerhack:
Legally, as a citizen of India, is there any protection, either from UIDAI, the Government, or any body that will be held accountable if our Aadhaar data gets compromised by the NSA/FBI. The recent (re)authorization of Section 702 of the FISA act allows them to collect data and communications of foreigners, and if we've learned one thing, they'll be picking Aadhaar apart for their own ends. They've been suspect of mishandling such data before, and I'd expect no better this time around.

What protects us as citizens of India? Can I sue UIDAI? How do I legally prevent foreign authorities from getting *my* data? [deleted] Thank you so much for this! A question on the position of foreigners living in India: Many expats seem to feel that Aadhar doesn't apply to them. However, many services are asking to link an Aadhar number. Could anyone give some insight in the situation here? Are foreigners exempt? Hi thanks for the AMA.
When I linked my bank account in PNB with Aadhaar,I received the message that it could not be done as Aadhaar had already been seeded.How is it possible?Could they know my Aadhar from somebody elses and can they link it without my request? Has any of you got any threats direct or indirect or faced any consequences for standing up against Aadhar which means standing up against big business and the govt? Now that a CIDR has been put in place what will be the best way going forward with regard to privacy ?


UIDAI giving out only yes/no responses seems good working ID with privacy isnt it? I was surprised how my whole details got populated in a sim application using my UID and fingerprint. It is established that UID/Fingerprints can be compromised. Thus by making uidai to give only yes/no responses only for cross-checking who the person he says he is. Is the Aadhaar team taking security seriously and has it ever been audited by a 3rd party security company? How do we know if our personal data is stored with strong encryption and controls in place? Also, why is user privacy not taken seriously? 

Please take what Troy Hunt says seriously: https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/954280702752841728 China had come up with a surveillience method of it's own called social credit system mentioned in this article: http://www.wired.co.uk/article/chinese-government-social-credit-score-privacy-invasion
In the article, the author claims surveillience is the truth of the future. The better way is to tell the citizens they are being observed, and Let them know what the govt know or thinks about them. 
My question is, do you think surveillance is unstoppable and if not loudly, it will be done secretly? If there a mechanism to force the govt to actually act on the SC order in a timely fashion? Suppose on 25th March the SC states that mandatory linking is not legal, but the govt does not withdraw its order for mandatory linking of Aadhar to bank accounts, banks can still shut down accounts right?  A question for Prof. Chinmayi, can the AADHAAR Act be deemed unconditional as it is a case of excessive delegation to the UIDAI by the government even though there was no discussion of the same in the Parliament ( as it was pushed as a money bill)  What is the status of the Aadhar requirement for filing of Income Tax returns?

There were a few individuals who went to the court and got an exemption for filing of returns without Aadhar, but I don't think any of the courts gave a generic order allowing anyone without Aadhar to file taxes.

What are you all doing about your incomes? Do you have Aadhar already? If not, what is your plan for your IT returns since non-filing of returns when you have an income is *not legal*?


Tagging everyone ...

Why did this protest against AADHAR not happen earlier and happening when making aadhar is going at a relatively fast pace . The deadline to attach aadhar to mobile and bank account has come near.
2. What does future hold for me?
Do I have to submit my Aadhar to mobile and banks by 31 March?
 Somebody should make an UIDAI bot. Any new issue, follow the following steps:

1. deny
2. personal attacks
3. FIR, Disable Aadhaar
4. ""So what if your details are known""
5. ""Biometric is still secure""
6. ""Orchestrated campaign""
7. SC Affidavit: ""One stray incident; all secure"" these days an individuals name, email, phone number, dob can be easily gathered from various sources. I have friends who registered for a private company in the morning and get relevant phonecalls by evening. 

What exact (additional) threat does Aadhaar lead to in terms of data privacy or data leaks (when it is already happening from several sources) ? Can you help explaining in a layman's perspective ? 

Note: I understand the aspect of ultimate control of udai, denying social benefits and other technology issues. I want to know more from a data leak perspective ?  Have we gained nothing by adhaar ? Isn't it adding any value although i understand it might be adding newer issues To all the experts- if you could ask UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey 3 questions, what would they be? As someone who thinks Aadhaar is a good concept for Indian conditions and a believer in a nationwide unique id to identify the resident/citizen and wants to improve it rather than abandon it:             

Aadhaar is useful as a transaction non repudication/authentication mechanism. The PDS disbursal and MNREGA disbursal though error prone was airtight as a feature to identify the particular instance of benefit.                  
In my opinion, the extension of the mechanism(authentication) to link bank account and mobile number is where it went wrong, since these are not ephemeral transactions but a permanent linkage.        
What's in your opinion could have been a better method to implement the linkages using the Aadhaar framework.              

Thanks.   [deleted] Does the govt have the right to demand and store our biometrics in a database? Does the existence of such a database not a violation of some fundamental right? What arguments citizens US and UK give against biometric database? There are a lot of voices emerging, with very different emotions. Most folks seem to associate the acceptance of Aadhaar with nationalism (if you love the country, why not adhere to it). Sentiments aside, what it the worst possible outcome and what is the best possible outcome that can come out of the hearings in the Supreme court regarding the project? Is it compulsory to link UAN with aadhar? I have been getting reminders from the organization I work for. Hello everyone, Can please anyone help me in proving that the data taken for Aadhar is fully safe & secure by it's procedure? please rply if anyone knows anything today asap Isn't giving away bio metrics similar to giving fingerprints for passports etc? What is the hullaboo with making AADHAAR mandatory? [deleted] There are fake pan numbers and fake beneficiaries of govt welfare. That causes unfair loss of tax money. How do we eliminate them if not by Aadhar? Hey experts, looking at the fact that aadhaar has been widely criticised and has a lot of flaws, is the way to deal with it merely fixing it's problems or does it need to be completely scrapped. Justices Jasti Chelameswar and S.A. Bobde are sitting Supreme Court judges who were earlier part of the original 3-judge bench hearing the Aadhaar case.

Also being part of the 9-judge constitution bench hearing whether privacy is a fundamental right, both of them decided in favour leading to an unanimous verdict.

My question is whether their exclusion from the current 5-judge constitution bench hearing the validity of Aadhaar negatively impact the final verdict for the petitioners?

This is assuming that three or four judges of the current 5-judge bench may not be favourably disposed towards the idea of privacy being a fundamental right. Are google,amzon,facebook incompetent by design? Do they address issues with privacy?
Zomato was sabotaged by swigy or uber eats who knows fish might need a bicycle some day.

What is grand plan to fix aadhar, directors/CTO's/founders/lawyers?!!
 I did put a question in your document, and tagged AskAadhaar on Twitter, but it wasn't answered. So, I guess I should try here.

> The AADHAAR uses fingerprint authentication. You could say that the 12-digit number is the username and my fingerprint is the password. My question is, how sure UIDAI is about the fingerprint system? Anyone's fingerprints can be easily obtained, and they cannot change it. So if I get someone's AADHAAR number and their fingerprint, can I not practically spoof that person?  Well, 438 comments before me. Even though I may get buried, I 

want to put in my questions. IMHO, questions need to be simple 

and without assumptions.

1) Is there a white paper on the technology ""guarding"" the bio-

metric database and has it been reviewed by independent or open 

source organizations?

2) The companies who put the technology in place - Have we 

ensured that they have not legally or illegally acquired the bio-

metric data? If we have, How? Has it been independently audited?

3) Even if bio-metric data is safe, how can we ensure that the local

reader of bio-metric data is not compromised? On a related note, 

are we making easily acquirable bio-metric data (like fingerprints) 

too important? They cannot be reset.

4) India being India, what guarantee does the common man have 

that there is no way anyone can see his Aadhar activity as a whole?

This has grave privacy connotations. Yes and I’m completely behind what you are saying but I would actually like at least an approximate figure of the money spent on the nightmare called Aadhar.  Will changing requirement of authentication for ration from monthly to yearly help? If a person authenticates once an year, then he can get montly ration for rest of the year. That will reduce leakage and also the trouble for the common man is reduced. How good is the biometric lock? What can i do as a citizen?  Have you completely read my comment. I said he is right.  it seems the Judge C looks at this as being a legal definition problem, and not a techno-legal one.

After reading through the posts of yesterday, i am of the opinion that he seems to think that if the rules are defined clearly, everyone would follow them, and then there would be no problem.

that has not been the case so far, and i see no reason for it to be. those in power don't seem to care for the rules, and approaching the SC everyday is going to be a nightmare.

past experiences with the rule changes [during DeMo] gave a not-so-comfortable feeling for any future contacts with the powers of the day.

i am not sure if i am making the correct inferences.

anyone have any opinion? [deleted] When are you going to link aadhar cards with voter id? This will ensure only Indian citizen the right to vote unlike those illegal Bangaldeshis who come across the borde, obtain a ration card and get voting rights To whoever: do y'all think that your fight is severly myopic, and pertains only the security of a certain section of upper-caste India? Do you realise the potential that this system holds, no not in the security flaws sense, but in the sense that it actually is benefitial to ppl who can't afford the cars you drive, houses you live in, and vacations you take. 

Have you ever wondered to be a part of the change rather than sit in your air conditioned homes and just criticize?

And before you paint me an enemy, I am not affiliated with a political party, or just tryna diss you. 

I really fail to understand how intelligent ppl like you (TED Fellows, and what not) are doing nothing to make it better. Your armchair critiques will only drown India further down the sink.",AMA,2018-01-25 21:31:13
Bill gates had an AMA and we collectively missed the opportunity to question him about his UIDAI endorsements[NP],0,av015d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/av015d/bill_gates_had_an_ama_and_we_collectively_missed/,3,"As most of you might know, Bill Gates has been tweeting in support of universal identity programs and endorsing UIDAI and Aadhaar as some sort of panacea for all issues.

How to manufacture a Twitter trend,63,4fff2h,http://www.livemint.com/Consumer/FmndRnomzWZlXye0rFEfSK/How-to-manufacture-a-Twitter-trend.html,34,,Watdf," This story concerns brands. There is another service these people offer: political trends. 

When you are advertising for a brand, the ultimate goal is profit. I can get behind that. But when you advertise for political parties/personalities, it counts as propaganda. I think that is very dangerous. 

A case in point is the 'Asaram Bapu is innocent' trends. You can see random people tweeting about it every day. They are clearly paid to do it and possibly are working with some agency. Most of the trends which admonish one political party or the other, are also manufactured by using influencers. 

I think what is happening on Twitter is very unethical and bordering fraud.  I already made a post about influencers asking about what they do but no response. we need a AMA with any influencer. I have few friends who are pretty active with blogging sites like blog adda are getting paid to post tweets about various products. Like when they launch a new product they will ask these people to tweet about them paying about 100 to 200rs per tweet or by giving them freebies. Ask BJP Ever wondered how Asaram sadhaks manage to trend #Bail4Bapuji & other shit on Twitter every now & then?

This is how it works. They have a whole army of unemployed idiots who have created numerous Twitter & FB profiles. Most of them are paid & the rest are blind followers of Asaram. They all live in tier 2 & 3 towns. Collectively this bunch of idiots are called ""Asaram Twitter Sewa Team (ATST)"".

Now there is one person named Liladhari Prasad (@liladhariprasad) who is kind of manager of these idiots. All sadhaks are in touch with him on Twitter & FB. Every now & then this manager announces on FB about the next trending topic, hashtag, time, day etc. Then he deletes that post from FB and the army is out on Twitter at the agreed time and date to trend in support of Asaram.

So this is how it works and just based on Twitter trends, media (even international one like BBC) is fooled into believing that there is tremendous support for Asaram in India! 

 I want to know how trends are manufactured here on r/India.  How a sub with opposing views turned into a circle jerk.  This is what you call shills. There was an [ET article (cached)](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/did-aiadmk-actually-hack-facebook-an-email-says-so/articleshow/51874018.cms) [the 2 days old original article is now 404] about how a leaked mail showed AIADMK using tools (Facebook switcher tool) to ""hack"" Facebook to generate trending posts. It seems like there is nothing illegal about it though. ""Social engineering"" using technology I guess is a valid strategy to achieve what you want, and manipulate the [social construction of reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Construction_of_Reality) to your benefit.

Ahh  so yesterday was the day PC figured the difference between PR agency led TV and print media vs social media ! this was predictably worse than the woody harrelson & chris cornell AMA.. I wonder if typed her answers in that fake accent. She actually has a scumbag on her head.  What exactly went wrong there? How come ALL her answers are downvoted and have negative karma?

"AMA : I orchestrated a protest against an impossible force(corrupt businessmen,media, politicians & police) for justice in India and won. It changed the system in an entire state. This post is meant to be a guide for whistleblowers on ""How to run a successful campaign in India as an ordinary person""",552,8gziej,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8gziej/ama_i_orchestrated_a_protest_against_an/,79,"Last year, I had made a [post on this very subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) asking your help to fight against injustice. I was a desperate person at that time and didn't think that there is any chance that it will be successful. After writing that post, I unknowingly became the mastermind behind a protest against corrupt college administrators, corrupt police officers and the media which would refuse to listen to us because they were getting money from these corrupt people.

This incident involves the torture and the death of a student caused by the college management, bribing the police and media to keep quiet, several months of protests which bloomed into a state-wide-unrest forcing the politicians to change sides, arrest & imprisonment of the absconding chairman of a college, vice principal, owners etc and finally the reform of the education system of an entire state! And, I was the one who orchestrated the protest which resulted in all of this. I spent every conscious hour of two months of my life working behind this campaign.

I dont want to repeat the entire incident, so you can read about the incident in detail in it's well written [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_College_of_Engineering_and_Research_Centre). Make sure to read about the student death controversy and then the police report which is below under different subsection. Also you can go through my old posts in this subreddit like [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) and [this photo](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5niiw4/this_is_not_saudi_arabia_they_are_not_muslims/)

I am making this AskMeAnything so that my experience can help people who think ""I am just an ordinary person, I can't change the system, I can't protest against injustice."" or ""They are rich and corrupt, so there is no way to bring them to justice, so I should better move on with my life and do nothing"" or ""All the problems is due to the current system/government and I can't do anything about it"".

I was a no one in this incident. I didn't know the victim. I was not even a student of that college at that time. I was an ex-student. I had no ""benefit"" in doing any of this. Also, I did all of it anonymously. No one except about 5 friends know that I was working behind the scenes. 

Also, my major contribution was in directing the protest, contacting the right people, managing the information and running the campaign. I did majority of it by just sitting in a room with a laptop. There were hundreds of other brave people who staged the protest and did the things which I wanted to be done.

I didn't start out thinking I will coordinate this protest or spend so much time on it. This all started out when I started a Facebook page asking justice for the victim. I regularly posted new content and people started contacting me with new information or asking me what they should do. Within few days, I was having so much contact with so many people from various backgrounds like students, teachers, reporters, lawyers, ex-students, parents etc that I unknowingly became the one who was running the entire campaign both online and offline.

So many people selflessly helped in finding information. Some law students of other colleges volunteered to write legal notices or other such stuff. Some people traveled great distances to find certain information. Some people had contacts with politicians and was able to mobilize partymen. Some brought in media. Some were reporters who were directly taking content from me and posting it. Some were helping in the creation of the content. And, I had to ensure that the content I was providing is true.

After about a month of work, it started showing signs of success. We started to get the attention of mainstream media who started posting the full details without censoring anything. Then, few weeks later, this became the headline news of all the newspapers in the state. It became the talk of the town. I overheard so many people discussing about this incident while travelling in trains or buses.

Then, student protests broke out at many private colleges across the state demanding student unions and fighting against injustices. Few colleges even lost their affiliation and closed down due to this incident. And, students of one such engineering college was transferred to better colleges. My friends and relatives at several other colleges said that the situation has improved after this incident.
",HelpSaveStudents," Someone should make this into a movie. Seriously. It would give hope to a lot of people, and plus it probably wouldn't be too expensive to make.  How did you deal with all the stress from it?  What changes do you want to see at the top level management or through the board of trustees of any given college? Profs and Management in Indian colleges treat students like dogs.

Then Times of India publishes an article ""Why No Microsoft or Apple from India?"" well done OP. india sorely needs more people like you. A word of caution to anyone who draws inspiration from this: keep your goals real and also keep in mind that the threats to your life are very real.

There are plenty of good people in india, plenty willing to stand for what is right. The trouble is that many among them become mute spectators to the tragedies and injustices in india. What you did, OP, deserves tremendous praise and you deserve it.

Mark my words, though, this is a very dangerous thing to do in a country like india. You may be anonymous now but don't count on this always being the case. Tread cautiously. Guys like you give me hope about the country . A breather from the general r/india  'let's emigrate' crowd. Respect for you man  Great job man, thats all i can say i hope this empowers more people to speak up against wrong doings around them.  Are you still continuing? Much respect.  How about 

1. someone in the community here makes a FB page to out corruption anonymously
2. We sticky the post on reddit
3. Get behind crowdsourcing evidence against corruption (aka. the evidence is sent annonymously either through fb messages or through redddit) 


The master above can provide all the expertise needed. 
2-3 people manage the page jointly and completely annonymously. There is life risk in this for sure


 Didn't know #JusticeForJishnu had such a mastermind. Well done OP ! You are a true inspiration.

Proud of you aliyaaa !!! Were you afraid while doing this? Oh wow, I have a lot of friends who passed out from this shitty college and I've only heard bad things about their management. Nowhere have I seen such a unified hatred amongst ex students towards their own college such as this! That speaks volumes as to how bad the situation really is.  I'm so glad that you orchestrated this while remaining anon and did not sacrifice your safety for the greater good. More power to people like you!  How did you make sure your identity wasn't compromised?  I can't upvote you enough Great job and kudos to you. After reading the wiki page I felt enraged at how degrading the management can be. You taught them a good lesson. Proud of you. Were you or your family threatened at any point? What can we do to protect ourself from all that threats?

I respect what you have done for the society. I hope you will give your voice to forthcoming issues and continue activism. Holy shit, that Wikipedia page is dank! This is very cool dude. Well done. I am very proud of you. This gives me hope.  This needs to be more visible within India. Every parent of a teenager needs to know that such evil colleges exist and they should  be very mindful of where they are getting their children admitted. 

The more I think about it the more it reminds me of my own college days and ragging controversies that we got involved in as Freshers. I feel that we need a directory of all schools and their faculty, staff and facilities with ranking. We need to crowd source it to get a lot of data in. Anyone know of such a website? ISDb.org (Indian Schools Database) anyone?

Well done OP! You’re a hero! I want to see more posts like this everyday, good work dude. 

I read the wiki page, your college seems to have every kind of repressive idea executed with North Korean efficiency. So have the laws against beards, the genders interacting and 'idi muris' been discontinued?  If not do you plan to address these issues? Singham 4 What are you doing these days ? Respect for you bro. India needs a serious overhaul of the education system and hopefully these protests and persistence will help in that. A post yesterday claimed the victim was targeted because he was involved in a political protest in his village. Any truth to that?  Madrchods taking a life of a young guys. Wish they rot in hell 

Kudos OP.  Are you Anna Harare? ",AMA,2018-05-04 22:08:03

Hey /r/India,

A little while back in an AMA request thread /u/lazyass_tiger suggested Chang. We reached out to Chang and he was awesome enough to agree! Here is the verification image: http://i.imgur.com/e4TebDE.jpg

Chang is one of the very few Indians who are of Chinese origin. Despite the disadvantage that people with Mongolian/North Eastern features have to face on a visual medium like TV/Movies, he has managed to overcome the stereotyping to a large extent and has done mainstream TV/Bollywood work. 

In case you haven't had a chance to see his work, here is a clip from Indian Idol, the show which made him a household name:

> http://youtu.be/PcILrWSrpNE

Chang made his big screen debut in Yash Raj Film's Badmaash Cmpany alongside actors Shahid Kapoor and Anushka Sharma. He has hosted numerous TV shows like, Indian Idol, Indian Premier League, IIfa Awards, India's Got Talent etc. I got to know today that he will be playing an important character in the much awaited film [Detective Byomkesh Bakshy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Byomkesh_Bakshy!)

Besides music and movies Chang is an adventurous traveller where he indulges in sky diving, quad bike racing, shark cage diving and similar escapades. He is an avid reader, experimental foodie and sketches in his leisure time. He is an extremely talented self-made individual and we are sure that you will enjoy this interaction.

**Date**: Feb 24. **Time**: 4 PM IST ",kash_if," Met him in office once, don't know.if he remembers. But chilled guy. Seen him once in an ad with chris gayle, I think. 

Nice to see another Chinese origin Indian like moi on reddit! I just hope he not Muslim like moi, because that would reduce my uniqueness... Few Indians of Chinese origin? There is a whole community in Kolkatta and in certain cities of the North East, plus me, my grand-father was Chinese. Thanks mods! [deleted] I really thought he was from the North East All right. Tis the Indian Idol guy right? His face looks so similar to the dude coming on Animax advertising theentertainmentcouncil.com thing. :/ (I'm racist I guess, but they literally look very very similar) I hope he brings Monali along. Oh please.

I have such a huge crush on her. 

Mods, can you request him? I swear I will be a good boy. nice.. Looking forward to it! East Asian people are so adorable. Is it just me or do i actually find asian women AMAZINGLY attractive? New to this !! How to be part of the interaction ? Where to ask him the questionss ?  Chang...what are your future plans....movies, songs...

I feel sad that saar is ignoring us. In the landmark judgement by high court today about Bhai, I thought it's right time to ask saar again what they think. 

Your party has been ruling Orissa ever since Independence. But today it has worse [HDI than](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_and_territories_by_Human_Development_Index) even Bihar. 

Those wikipedia HDI numbers are from 2006. The [latest HDI list](http://i.imgur.com/JQTPQST.jpg) I can source is data from 2010, in this [UNDP report published in 2011](http://www.in.undp.org/content/dam/india/docs/inequality_adjusted_human_development_index_for_indias_state1.pdf). It shows that Orissa actually slipped behind Chattisgarh, to become the least developed state of India.

How do you justify being a party to one of the worst examples of continuous mismanagement of a state in Indian history? (edit: BJD having ruled the state for last 15 years, after which you are worse than Chad.)

To the mods: This question is not for a reddit user. Its for an MP, who is a public figure. Don't delete it please.

Edit - added word in brackets. Lol, He ran away when randia started to ask tough questions.  Yaar, why does everyone use the word ""ruling"" and not ""serving"" the people.  A good question. But this MP and his PR have in general, been pretty reasonable in answering questions. So, we should prolly wait for a response before judging. You could also page /u/kumbhakaran. IIrc he is the policy analyst.

Also.. wording is a bit rude in the post atm ? Reddit ka shaap lag gaya usey

A huge proportion of their mps are dynasts.They're also a party steeped in corruption and horsetrading.I raised this on the AMA thread itself, but since BJD is part of the extended NDA along with aiadmk, majority of this sub wasn't interested and lapped up all the nonsense that this MP and his PR guy spewed. /u/rajarajac did support though.The best part? The user who though that bjd was the best party ever because of that ama-the same user whom I corrected- now goes on other threads and claims he was the one who called BJD's bluff.

I doubt he will be so computer literate?  Just by itself, reading the statement, I'd say this person has a warped sense of reality, too much time on his hands and doesn't really understand the concept of progress through advancement - or maybe a combination of all those.    
Porn isn't the root cause for any of the problems India faces at the moment, not even rape. Our ancestors penned the Holy Grail of sex (Kamasutra), we're poised to take over the mantle of most populated country (someone's definitely fucking).. Yet, porn is where we draw the line? For fuckin' real?    
I won't be rash enough to dismiss his claims before I get to know his point of view on this. If he's got a valid train of thought on how banning porn will help India, I'd like to hear it. And if he's on this 'enlightened'  path of banning porn just for the sake of it, well he's just another delusional cunt - We have a horde of those in this country. You sure? http://i.imgur.com/q7rBLnu.jpg "" I saw no women come forward and speak up against pornography, so I did it"" - says Kamlesh Vaswani. Wow.

Since I'm going for a short times arriving on Saturday morning and leaving on Sunday evening I want to get most out of it! But not want to do only tripadvisor stuff. So want to know some tips or itinerary for these 2 days. Staying in Bunkyard and travelling by myself, thanks!",jasperm92," The Eklingji temples are a really beautiful collection of Shiva temples and are about 45 minutes from the city. Go around the temple and explore a little instead of seeing only the main front portion. 

The lakes and city palaces are, of course, the obvious visiting spots and for good reason. 

Also, there is a cheap and authentic Rajasthani restaurant near the royal vintage car show which I enjoyed. 

E: The Jagmandir temple is very famous and is in the city itself. 

There is also the Shrinathji temple where people go to from all over India as pilgrims but you may not enjoy it that much as it is crowded and small. 

 [Pics](http://imgur.com/a/FtQLU)

One day Program:

* Morning: City Palace 
* Late Morning/Afternoon: Boat tour of the late, starts from inside City Palace
* Evening: Bagore Ki Haveli Show
* Dinner: Hotel Ambrai. Make sure you call them and get a reservation.

Second day Program:

* Morning: Saheliyon-ki-Bari
* Lunch: Dal Bati at Natraj Hotel
* Walk around the old city - shopping

Take an auto rickshaw ride in the old city to go from one place to another. They drive like crazy on those congested roads. It is like a joy ride!

Things to avoid:

* Avoid Sajjan Gadh.
* Avoid temples, unless you are interested in architecture or religion.

Edit:

Made bunch of edits, as I remembered stuff from my last December's trip. Besides the obvious lake palace etc. I had a good time eating dal bati at

After that a nice boat ride on the lake. 

In the night I had some beers at the hostel. Great hostel, bunkyard hostel.

This morning I went to the monsoon palace great views over the mountains and Udaipur. Would definitely go back there! Thanks you all for the advice!

I recently emmigrated from India. AMA.,18,9dkov2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dkov2/i_recently_emmigrated_from_india_ama/,46,"I spent a majority of my childhood outside India in the middle east. I returned to India roughly 20 years ago. I had fully settled in to India. I didn't quite miss anything from the middle east barring the food and stable electricity :P 

I had a choice to make about 10 years ago, to move out of India and I chose not to. Mostly because my friend circle, my gf, and most of my family was in India at the time. I found a job in a great company that kickstarted my career fairly well. 


Due in part to my own existential crisis, due in part to a change in outlook around 6 years ago(post MBA) and due in part to everything that has been happening in the country for the last few years, I gradually started finding living in the country to be unbearable. This is not an anti-BJP post by any means. I've never been political and I do not see myself ever being. I do have ideologies which at the very core is ""Live and let live""....or to be blunt....Unfortunately and I'm sure a lot of you agree, the Indian society simply isn't going to let you do that. Its not that I was living a loud/flamboyant life. Its that even the simple life I tried to live was being threatened in several ways. 

This group, r/india though often negative in tone has also helped open my eyes to a lot of things. This discourse is important, if for nothing else, as an outlet for folks who are frustrated. For folks to empathize and sympathize.

At this point, we begin a change in tone...........

I saw my friends, colleagues and classmates gradually all leave the country. Some of them left around 8-10 years ago. None of them show a genuine interest in returning. But this didn't really bother me. I still had a great friends circle and I've always been exceptionally great and keeping in touch with my friends and meeting them every chance I get. Nothing was changing my mind that I needed to move out. 

But one day, something just snapped. I spoke to a friend of mine over dinner. She was a classmate from college. She had been working with a firm in Australia. See the thing is, she and I never spoke in college but we just knew each other. I saw on fb that she was in town, we got chatting and decided to meet up. She was asking why I don't look for opportunities abroad. I said I never felt that things are necessarily that much better there. She said she could potentially find me a job. 

I found out that she and I were in similar industries. She was earning(post-conversion) around 60L more than me. I told her that really doesn't matter given living costs. She told me she 'saves' roughly 20 LPA. And believe me, she's not someone who tries to save. This was a time when I was commuting about 90 minutes one way to work. 8km. She travels 20 minutes to work and can afford to stay away from the central/expensive parts of the city due to great public transport. 

She lives a healthy and fun life. Has co-workers who know to stick to their boundaries. Has no one bother her about what she wears, who she's with, what she eats etc. I couldn't find a single objective measure, to counter her with. 

I made it my life's mission to find out for myself whether this was all truly the case. So I started looking out. Thankfully, my wife was offered a perfectly timed transfer to a western country for 2 years and that came with a Visa for me as well. And so I took the leap. Found myself a job before I landed here. 

Its been a few months now and I've finally seen what this other side is like today. This is an abrupt end to this post but that's because there's too much to write if I explained everything else.

So feel free now to ask me anything you want about my thoughts/experiences.

",fbai," Enjoy your life.
Hope you job and country suits you well.  What a fascinating and humane post. Curious Indian question: Is your then GF your now wife? Also, at what age did you and your family return to India? I am lucky that I make around 45 LPA in India and save around  35 Lakh. I don't have office and have no office timings. I am living in a village, my hometown. So overall a healthy life. I can get my health checked today without any waiting time. 

But one harsh truth I realized lately is that we are all going to die any way and none of these LPA comparison, instagram, facebook matters. I honestly wish I was born like 30 years before (where people lived peacefully and money doesn't matter) or 30 years later (where previous generation fucked up the environment for good and people will be eating tablets for their daily survival, where money doesn't matter)... omg, did I go too far !? .. :P     How old were you when you emigrated? What field do you work in? Was finding a job easy? You're so lucky that you and your wife are on the same page when it comes to moving abroad, but it does come with its fair share of struggles. I understand a lot of your relatives and friends might be looking at you as if you are living a very cosy life but there must be a whole bunch of struggles that you both might be having there.

Other than leaving your aging parents back home and subsequent mental trauma, what might be the struggles that you're facing there? Wow you're such a rare butterfly. Nobody ever emigrated from India before.  have you ever thought about the privileges you have that have allowed you to make this choice so easily?",AMA,2018-09-07 01:09:00

Hello /r/India. A.R. Rahman here.,300,25zkqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25zkqu/hello_rindia_ar_rahman_here/,76,Hello India! It should be really really early morning for you. Thanks for being awake and being a part of this. ,ARRahman," Glad to have you here! It's about 6 in the morning here, so I don't think many people are here right now. Hi. I've wanted to ask... You've worked with Hollywood, Bollywood as well as South Indian cinema. And continue to do so. What are the behind the scene differences that you observe in the working. Some specific things each industry focuses on.


Also, since you work in all 3 simultaneously, how do you choose which project to take up? You must have a much larger pool of options than composers who typically focus on one industry. TIA. He is...gone? OMG, are you going to do a simultaneous AMA on /r/India? 

Expect your inbox to explode with questions! 


EDIT: Looks like he just wanted to say hi! and is not answering any more questions. For those of you who missed it, [here is the official AMA thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25zed8/i_am_academy_award_winning_composer_ar_rahman_ask/) where some of us participated and there's a whole lot of gems in the comments. Enjoy! When do we get to listen to these hidden gems that never released, like Tu Kuja (male version), 40min versions of Arziyan, and Kun Faya Kun? or will we never? :( Great to see you on /r/India sir :)
Thanks for doing the AMA! Hi A.R. Rahman, 
Big fan here, Simple question, what music do you listen to/enjoy these days?  I went to one of you concerts as a kid (it had ""light"" in the title) back then I had heard your music but only remembered Vandemataram. I basically sat through the whole concert waiting for that one song and pretty much gave up, but then you finally played it as your closing number. As a kid, that was something else. Thank you for that. 

My question is, where do you draw your largest source of inspiration from? And how do you organize so many members of your band?  Hi, A.R.R. Do you meditate or pray, and how does that help or affect you ? Watching Rahman AMA at 6 in the morning was like watching a summer blockbuster release in January  His AMA is on r/IAmA. [Check it out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25zed8/i_am_academy_award_winning_composer_ar_rahman_ask/) No questions. Just a big heartfelt thank you for all the great music.  I set up alarm to talk with you. Could you please acknowledge my existence by replying to me. It would be my lifetime achievement that none other than the great music maestro replied to me.

Thank you for giving such good music every single time.

As for question:

Please share any funny incident that happened during making music for some movie.

Also, is it true that you work only during night time?

Thank you once again, sir. No question. No A huge fan here wishing you all the best.

Jai ho was great but you have even greater compositions. Personally I think Khawaja mere khawaja was your best so far. Mr. Bachchan once said that you told him about a divine inspiration you had during its composition. That was cool.
 Hello Mr.Rahman,
 Just a quick question. Do you ever get dis-illusioned by the Bollywood/tamil music industry whose main motive is to product ""hits"" and not actually push the envelope of music (like experimental music that might not be hit)? Money is a huge factor in any movie industry, do you feel it robs the true essence of an artist? Is he gone?? Damn

I wanted to ask him about superheavy and 127 hours :( Did the mods there verify his account in/r/Iama? I'm not able to find the verification. If not music where do you see yourself? I love you! /u/sunnydelish dragged him here. Thanks! 


ARRahman kept up his word. [The comment ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25zed8/i_am_academy_award_winning_composer_ar_rahman_ask/chm6avu) where he said he would drop a hello here. What is your proudest achievement? From the outside, you seem to be reluctant singer mostly going for non-duet songs. What factors do you use to arrive at the decision that, you, not someone else should sing.

 What one life advice you can give to everyone? What inspires you most to create music?

You are kind of a pioneer in blending both Western and Eastern music in your work, *and* making it sound great. Does one of these influence you more in terms of the theory as well as the techniques? How do you suggest someone approach music if one has to ""succeed"".

Which kind of music do you like and enjoy the most?

Do you think Indian classical music is relevant today and has a future?

Thanks! Thank you for the AMA. How do you find new talents? I have always been very curious how music directors find talents, especially new and rising composers. Good morning from India sir! Long time fan here! :PAny little known trivia about Superheavy that you want to share?Also, hypothetically, if you had a choice of collaborating either with John Lennon or Bono, who would you choose and why? I love all the songs and music you've done for Takshak movie. I don't have any questions, just wanted to say you're awesome. Thank you for the music. Oh wow. Didn't expect you to come visit this sub-reddit. Thanks!

1. How many languages can you speak?

2. Some of the lyrics are badly translated when dubbed, does it concern you?

3. (Okay, really ambitious/dumb question) Do you dream about music? What is something you feel you have missed out in your life because of your dedication to music? Ojo Hello, a huge fan here, thanks for all those great music and the goose bumps. Your music is divine.  What equipment do you use when you're on flights , travelling etc ? Hey Mr. Rahman, thanks for doing this AMA! I remember my mom and I saw you at the airport. She's such a huge fan of yours. My mom was so eager to get your autograph that she asked me to ask you to sign an autograph on the back of a check! My question is what is one of your more memorable/strange encounters with a fan? Thanks! Hi A.R. Rahman. I have two unrelated questions : 

1. How do you keep yourself motivated making such beautiful music day in and day out, year after year?

2. Any comments on Modi becoming PM? Hi Mr.Rehman,

Any of your most memorable stories with legend K.V.Mahadevan, please share here.
 So what are the current projects you are working on? And how did you learn about Reddit? What motivated you to do an AMA?  For someone who has heard bits and pieces of your discography, where do I start?   Do you think you'll work with Kamal Hassan some time in the future?  I just want to thank you for your music. Your music makes living a little bearable. Hey A.R., do you own any Audeze brand headphones? If so, how are they? Sir, 
Huge Fan !!
what would you advice to a person who has just started learning music (In my case playing guitar)? I'm too tongue tied to ask you anything sir... 
All I want to say is Thank You...
Thank You for your music... Bulb for r/india AR Rahman sir, i heard Lot of Music compositions & great Knowledge is there in ""Samaveda"". i hope you already refereed that. can i know how far it helped you.  Whoa!  Hello Rahman and welcome to reddit :) Wow /r/india, how did you manage to nab not one but TWO bollywood celebs?

You're totally gonna get facebooked. ;p As a young Indian male, trying to make it in the film industry, what advice do you have? I want to produce films, and I do currently work in LA as an assistant, but I am surrounded by white people mostly, it seems to be very tough for a person of color. hello sir.. great to see you here.. I wanted ask one question,,, have you done anything called Ekam Sathyam with MJ... if yes, your millions of fans would love to listen... Thanks Sir, I am from TamilNadu and big fan of Raja sir and You. What are your thoughts on Raja Sir and what is your favorite song of his ? He lived upto his word, can and said ONLY hello :( I am big fan of you Sir. Great to see you here. Looking forward for  some great music in your next film Vikram's I .

Should repost to /r/travel and /r/bicycletouring as they'd both be really interested in this and his subsequent AMA. what does he do? how did he manage to take a 6 month holiday?  Which bike? Brought a new one for this? What is the total cost of entire trip? What's the best and worst memory? Hi I am George Aikara - the 'friend' mentioned here. Its a motorcycle and not a bicycle. People doing it on bicycles are really crazy. I did meet a few on the way and I was a little miffed as I can't really act all cool in front of them :) Those guys need a lot of discipline physically I guess.. But thanks a lot for the interest and all the kind words you all have for me..

Oh I am new to reddit and I don't understand the ""You are doing it too much. Wait for 7 minutes.. "" thing. I have verified my email. If anyone knows how to get around this pls let me know.. Not able to reply to a lot of stuff.. I'm curious, wouldn't the red corridor areas be too unsafe to be going alone? At least from what I've heard  This is AmA worthy stuff! Your friend should totally do one! Salute to him. I will do this some day :D This is mad,
He is mad. In a good way. Amazing trip and amazing pictures on his FB page. Seeing this guy and the Englishman who biked from Malaysia to England, is inspiring me to do at least a short bike trip of India. 

I'm an Indian-American who has experiencing touring Europe. I'm curious to see what motherland offers.  indian forrest gump  Can't believe that no one asked for a proof. Good Job /r/India. Where did he start? Is it naga raj?  Wow, that is really incredible. Did he start from banglore? He missed the entire Konkan coast! The top loop in Ladakh is pretty impressive. Been there at 4000-5000 meters altitude (13000 ft) - in a jeep. I saw bicycles - were others can hardly walk a few meters up. That is simpressive. What does your friend do  for living ??? [deleted] He does have balls, OP.. please post links to AMA once he is ready for it! Capital of Gujarat is Gandhinagar. Post some pictures of his bicycle and other gear.  Have always dreamed of doing this.

Is it difficult to manage outside the major cities if you can only speak English? this is seriously cool... something i would love to do... or hear about ! is he an xBHPian ? waiting for the AMA All India in 6 months? That's amazing! Where's the Facebook link though? Wow. Did he go in a group?  For clarity, bike here refers to motorbike. In western context, bike almost always refers to bicycle.

Good Guy Imran,273,236vx2,http://i.imgur.com/uXsEylH.jpg,89,,grenar15," I am pleasantly surprised, reading the AMA. I didn't think much about him other than being just another Bollywood actor, which, in my book is not-very-interesting-unless-proven-otherwise. I think I'll have to rethink that prejudice of mine, after this.

He turned out to be quite candid in his answers, humble, articulate and knowledgeable about things outside of the little cocoon of Bollywood. Hell, he even answered something about boners ! That's a pretty cool dude, in my book. It's like we have our own Zach Braff on /r/india. [deleted] Also, he admitted that he didn't like one of his own movies. That takes guts. It was so sad to see people abuse him He specifically agreed to do this AMA because he did not have a movie coming out. 

He did not want this to be about a movie at all . anurag kashyap also didn't promote anything. First celebrity AMA I've seen that doesn't have a promotion included.  Not gonna do a whole lot of good promoting a movie to a couple hundred active redditors. not enough audience here on /r/india to promote anything. rajaji!  Cool guy. Don't love gotta movies but he's a cool guy  Well, I enjoyed Rampart®. I wonder how much effort he puts in his movies when he claims to have no interest in Bollywood. In a way, it makes him not unlike a lot of us who are working just for the money. In a creative medium like films, I don't think that's the right attitude to have. He only answered a select few questions though. Skipped dozens of reasonable questions. Guess he was too busy today. Oh well.  Yeah, nice try, Imran. Us key paas koi movie hai kya abhi? I thought he has retired?  Pedophile grenar15.

Additionally, if he wants in on the schedule, he needs to fill out the request form *at least* twenty four hours before the AMA. His movie Lootera is going to release in a few days. Most celebs do an AMA for promoting a production. Reddit is hardly a good medium to promote among the Indian audience but it is worth trying. what's his take on piracy?

Thanks. I'll ask more questions later. 
 Anurag Kashyap sir, a big fan here. Almost 10 years ago i read a story in Hindi literary magazine Hans. How could one approach some one to buy film rights of a story. How much should one offer?

I would be so glad if you could answer this. My question:

In GOW II When Faizal Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) tells Mohsina (Huma Qureshi) everything about himself (like he has killed a few people, smokes ganja etc.) before their marriage and asks her if she does anything like that, she tells him something in his ear. What exactly she said? Questions : 

* What makes you promote films like Aiyya?
* Do you watch any of the contemporary Hindi film?
* Now, it must have become easier, but initially how difficult was it for you to get sponsors/distributors?
* Any film by other good moviemakers in India that you think you could have done better? Any film of yours that you think other directors could have done better?
* Any regrets in life that make your films' characters so strong? Not meaning to harp on personal life if you dont want to talk about, though much of it is publicly known Big fan.

Some Q's from my side:

1. What are a few movies that have influenced your filmmaking?

2. What do you think about Gunda? What about Om Darbadar?

3. What type of movies would you like to make if you had infinite resources?
 What I want to know is ki isko downvote kaun kar raha hai? Do they have a problem with the man, or do they just don't like AMAs? This would be amazing, I sent him a request via twitter. Hopefully, he will respond. Or if someone here knows him, please convince him.  Let's get some upboats on this post bhailog!!! Keep this post alive and I believe we can do it (if he is not too busy right now).

Edit. Do not flood his twitter, I believe the confirmation has been received.  Which of the following filmmakers do u think are better than you [if any] and why [or why not] ?
1. Dibakar Banerjee
2. Shimit Amin
3. Vishal Bhardwaj
 What do you think of Vishal Bharadwaj's recent change of style? He is becoming absurdist with each movie.

ps: I like VB's later movies more than Maqbool or Omkara. I 'feel' (need to do more fact checking about this) that many of your movies have a stretched preclimax sequence/story arc/scene. Is this a conscious decision?  You seem to use scenes saturated by a color quite a lot. E.g. many scenes in Gulal, the investigation in cellar in Black Friday and few more. And I suppose this started from earliest of your movies, if I remember correctly Paanch had some saturated color scenes. Do you like this stuff or is it done with some clear objective in mind? Hi. Big fan 

1) Why didn't GOW release in cinemas in Australia/New Zealand and will Doga release in cinemas internationally?

2) Do you wish to ever make a blockbuster that rakes in the big bucks or are you satisfied with the 100 crore club movies being made which enables the productions houses to filter funds to your projects?

3) Do you feel that Bollywood  is star driven?

4) Who do you  think is/was to be the most talented female actors in Hindi cinema?

 Question 1 - What is the future of Indian cinema? 

Question 2 - What is your favorite PTA movie?

 Right, here are my questions (tweeting to him too, hopefully he will respond)

* How do you conceptualise the music for your films? Do you sit with the lyricist and the music director to ensure that the music is coherent with the narrative (I have found that the music in your films is woven intricately with the narrative). 
* How do you feel about the fact that most of the projects that you are involved in don't belong to that ""100 crore club"". On a related note, how do you gauge the success of your films?
* You seem to be encouraging (through your production house) a lot of new and independent film makers? How do you select which films to produce?  My questions. Huge fan of everything AK.   
1. Filmmakers like yourself in Indian cinema that you think are changing the game?    
2. How was working with Abhay Deol in Dev D, any plans of working with him again?      
3. I cant help but compare you to Tarantino, you both make such 'different' films and like him you have cameo appearances in films. Any particular reasons for that?   
4. Marlboro or Wills Classic?",AMA,2013-07-02 19:44:30
How did you discover reddit or r/india ?,6,59th29,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/59th29/how_did_you_discover_reddit_or_rindia/,28,and how many of you are from quora?,zabardastsinghsaini," I was happy posting dick pics on 4chan. Got into an argument one day with someone there. 

""Fuck off to reddit faggot"", he said. So i came here. Was a lurker on quora till the Indian Invasion and circlejerk began then fucked the fuck off of there.

I joined reddit specifically for browsing r/crackstatus.

Saw a couple of country based threads and wondered if something similar was in place for India and lo and behold I discovered r/india! Via CGP Gray and Brady Haran. Any fellow Tims here? Discovered it on Twitter. I met a guy online who went gung ho about reddit especially r/india. Was wanting to leave Quora for a long time and move on to reddit but was mostly discouraged because of the off putting UI. After this guy's such enthu I used to lurk here and thus got hooked onto it over time.  I started reading about Indian history and more about partition from quora. Realized it is full of too intelligent people (through thread suggestions), good for me. Found a comparison of reddit and quora and came to know of reddit. 
Then the NSG deal happened, didn't know how and what it helps to India. Did search with reddit, some decent info from users. Got interested in stock market. To read on it, found reddit r/IndiaInvestments/, account created.! Politics got me interested, found this sub. :)  'was looking for a news link aggregator and found a few of those like digg, stumbleupon, reddit, etc. Found that reddit has the easiest means of making a login, so made it. Thenceforth, I wondered if there was a /r/india and searched for it, ended up finding it. I hardly go beyond /r/india and /r/cricket now.   Heard a lot about reddit through tumblr. Tried avoiding it because I heard that there's plenty of misogynistic dudebros on this site. Then I met a friend who told me that he hung around the hip hop side of reddit so i decided to make an account. Only got active here after someone i know who works for an internet media company said that everything appears on reddit before it appears on any other social network. I quite like this place.  I discovered Reddit via f7u12. Obviously, searched for India once I got the hang of it. Been a lurker on Reddit for years, from the time when this sub was barely more than a placeholder. Although I was less frequent then (thanks, Nokia), and hardly stayed. Then somewhere down the line i quit fb/twitter/quora, and one day realised this is way better, so stayed. I'm spotting some of the same patterns here these days, but so far Reddit has proven to be resilient to major idiocy (mostly -ish) sometimes. 

No matter the future, I've enjoyed my time so far. Knew about reddit but never checked it seriously then one day I searched about India like I always do in every new website I find, then I ended up on /r/india and start lurking here. Came for r/dota2... Stayed here for the memes /r/Dota2
 Looking for discussion and updates news for my new phone, very helpful r/dota2. Dankest sub this world's ever fuckin' seen. I discovered reddit when the story titled 'India would be a Hindu nation by 2020' made news when it was posted in a subreddit about the Washington Nationals MLB team. Ama. Mkbhd (popular tech reviewer) did an ama once and that was the first time that i heard about reddit. From there on, Ama's by coroners, funeral directors, Crime scene clean-up guys and pathologists really got me hooked to reddit. 

If you haven't read thier ama you should check them out, its really informative. Found reddit a couple years ago as a forum to discuss video games, runescape and league, specifically. Reddit was also super fun and informative and is now an integral part of my daily routine. Net neutrality brought me to r/india. I've casually perused reddit since several years, via links in other websites or some online news provider. Used to browse r/medicine and others, cuz I found the perspective and problems faced by Western doctors to be a fresh change from the often lifeless forums based in India. 

Ironically, I discovered r/india recently after quitting Quora for having too many Indians upvoting the most mediocre content and masking the initial brilliance that drew me to the site. Must say, I prefer the community here (thanks to anonymity?).  Imgur->reddit.",AMA,2016-10-28 17:03:25
hey guys lets get this thing started,44,27aael,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/27aael/hey_guys_lets_get_this_thing_started/,174,,SalilAcharya," Hey I've heard about this radio city. It plays really good adverts. But I find the songs they play between adverts really irritating. even though they are sparing, it breaks the flow between adverts. 

Could you please eliminate all songs and stick to the true purpose of radio stations i.e. playing adverts? Thanks.  How much bigger do your biceps need to be? what are your views on pranking on radio? Do you think people have a right to consent before you air it? It does cause humiliation of those getting pranked and you already must know of that infamous case where a lady committed suicide after she gave info inadvertantly about the royal baby. It's kind of hard to believe that all the calls that *Baua* on red fm makes are genuine, are they?  I saw Aashiqui 2, even though your role was small, i noticed one thing, you'd look better as a villain or a negative character instead of a good guy. Its your looks. They make you look like a natural baddie. Hi, why are you typing like a spacker? Hyderabadi biryani or Lucknowi biryani? Food! As a fitness expert, what food do you avoid / suggest? 

Why do Indians put on a lot of weight after 30? 

TBH, I did not knew about you before this AMA.. so thanks for doing this.

Subah ho gayi maamu! (something in mumbai language I know of) Hi Salil,

Welcome. Thanks for AMA.

from your Bio - 2007 one movie and 2013 another move. Much gap between 2movies. Any reason for it.

EDIT: Number
 Welcome saar... 

1) How much of the shows are LIVE & how much of it is pre-recorded? 

2) Do people recognize you/your voice as the RJ in your day to day interactions? 

3) Do people actually remember about the RJs & their respective Radio Stations? As in, if anyone comes up to you & relates you to another station instead of Radio City?

4) How do they judge the popularity/listeners/ratings of you guys. 

5) How many of the ""callers"" are genuine & how many are actors? 

6) How much of the music is Pirated or just downloaded off the internet? :P

Edit:

8) who are the hottest female RJs on radio across all the stations? :P You're obviously a fitness buff,

1. Did you ever take any steroids to get an edge? 

2. What is your workout routine like? 

3. Why Shitzus? 

4. Are you a reddit regular? If not, how did you decide to do an AMA here? 

  How did you get into rj-ing? did you knew about reddit before this? What is your favorite dialog from the movie Gunda? Before time ki gaadi hai yeh toh! [](/lol) Do you like VJing better or RJing? 

Who is the best guest you have hosted ? 

I recently heard your interview with Celina Jaitely. Where do you stand on LGBTQ issues in India?  Hi Salil, 

DLF or Mumbai?  Do you like doing soaps? 
I've heard horror stories that the schedule is tiring and monotonous. 

What was it like to work with Balaji Telefilms?  What are your preferences, Namo/chaddi gang or Aaptard? [deleted] how do you feel about the current generation of actors, except 1-2 almost every actor now is son of some previous actor,director,producer?

do you think now it's possible for someone from non acting background to get on the top?

also tell us something about actors (tv or movies) and RJs which everybody get's wrong or have a completely wrong perception ?
 koi chutkula sunaiye.. 
 oak guys I'm off well do another #ama soon meanwhile @salilacharya is where ill be and for those interested my next film 3am releases on sept 19th cheers 

and thanks for showing up  Gosh, this guy needs a scribe while typing. Nothing to ask. Just wanted to let you know that I like your shows on the days I manage to catch it. Kudos and keep up the good work ! How do you handle disagreements with your guests? Clearly there are topics where you aren't on the same page with a civic authority or a politician. How do you keep it to yourself? If you do let it out, what is the protocol? Hi Salil, saying hello and a pic of a blast from the past

http://i.imgur.com/S8Jrjr8.jpg

Cheers  Where is your **INTRO** dumbass?? How much is the hashtag corporation paying you for your liberal usage of #s in every single frickin' reply?

Did you recover from your shoulder/neck injury. I remember it was pretty bad but you had this killing attitude even when you were in so much pain Saarr how many people listen to radio? and how to get an AMA without being famous? 1)  I used to ride by cycle 80-100 miles a week and I quit. Now, I can't even ride 5 miles a day. Any suggestions on improving? 


2) What do you've to say about all the criticism on crossfit?  Especially about that dude who broke his neck? 


3) how was it work with danny glover in the movie 3 A.M?  I hear Spike Lee is a dick, is that true?

Hi Priyanka... wow this is so amazing to talk with you here on reddit.. I am a big fan!

however I have a question about your dad. A road is going to be named after him in Mumbai. But I don't understand why he deserves it. Wikipedia does not give much info and I couldn't find anything in Google. [Media these days](http://gulfnews.com/woman-accuses-miss-world-s-father-of-sexual-abuse-1.408377) in India never post anything good about celebs. So I would totally appreciate if you enlighten me why Government is naming a road after him. 

Thank you! luv xoxo Yup. She's exactly what I expected her to be. A pretty intellectually vacuous bimbo, not that there's anything wrong with that, of course. /u/amey_is_monkey is on fire. So this is the first AMA where I had to go to the OP's history to see what she answered. She has been downvoted like anything, hence comments not visible on the page. Epic. This guy is nuts or an accomplished troll.

http://www.reddit.com/user/devvishn bakwas ama. downvoted (the ama, not this thread) AMA haha. More like rant whatever you want I ain't answering.  Dayum the AMA is a trainwreck This has to be the most boring AMA ever.  I never really hated her,  but after this I do  >This has been interesting. Thank you guys for your time. I'm sorry I could not get to everyone's questions but I hope you enjoyed this as well.

Unlike imran khan who uploaded a pic.she just sent a Twitter msg.how do we know it's her or someone else? like her correspondent doing it for her. Ghanta AMA this is. Not even a single real question she has answered yet.

Downvoting. She got pounded bad. LOL! ChopRampart this post has more upvotes than the AMA itself. Well, if the AMA was intended to be a PR boost for her, it seems to have completely backfired. That's probably the biggest AMA disaster this year on reddit! Best AMA ever! How did the fraandship guys come to know about reddit?

She gave a huge competition to rampart's AMA. And won it, too :D /u/ImranKhanAMA. Aap ka kya kehna hai bhai sahab?  I don't get it. Why is everybody celebrating?

Some days back someone wanted to buy my 2 years old phone for Rs 10K but I wasn't interested and now this site tells me it's worth only Rs 3017.  Are these AMA's or ads now? This sounds like an advertisement of their new startup.  How to set a reminder? Now, Shopclues and Amazon have also entered this space, so its already hyper competitive. Though its also about unboxed products, but relevant. Interesting concept but still needs some work. I have a barely used Leap Motion controller. I thought I could sell it there, but couldn't find any category. What electronic items are excluded while buying back from customers? I recently got a led TV from online popular website with a exchange offer redirecting me to your site. But sadly the response I then got from your personal/staff was not as per online store terms and very unsatisfactory. Looks like you people don't buy Ctr monitors or TV any longer. Be more specific on your website to exclude what ever ""electronic"" items you don’t buy back.

edit: Also just wanted to add that got a better deal on the laptop on OLX compared to what your site is offering. You people quoted about 25% of the price, but I sold it for on OLX for four time more than what is being offered from your website. Ah shit I'll be on train. Atleast I'll be able to see your comment questions and answers.

How come No data in title as per usual though? I just used your website, the UI could be better and the UX is terrible. You forced me to put my details in before showing me a quote which was way lower then I expected. Needless to say I won't be coming back to your website because of the double negative and I'm worried that you will spam me because you never mentioned anywhere while collecting my phone number and email that you won't be sharing these with anyone. Can I get details on how much fund u raised and on what valuation?

And how to do valuation?

'Although a trained Engineer, Suneel received a Diploma in Filmmaking (Writing and Direction) from the Prague Film School. After working in the direction department on Prakash Raj’s directorial debut NAANU NANNA KANASU, he became an Assistant Director on B Suresha’s National Award winning PUTTAKKANA HIGHWAY.

Air pollution in cities across the country even the likes of Bombay and Madras are unhealthy (just not as bad as Delhi).

I'm the Founder of AirAirAir.org.


**Smokey** is a [friendly air pollution chatbot](http://m.me/smokeybot). that works in Facebook Messenger. Now you can easily monitor the air quality levels in your city effortlessly every day, and learn what you can do about it to protect yourself and your families. You can search for “smokey air” in Facebook Messenger app, or just click on [http://m.me/smokeybot](http://m.me/smokeybot). It's totally free and works like magic for many cities around the world. 


I recorded this short video yesterday to talk briefly about the air pollution in Delhi: https://youtu.be/siF-lZHLeN4  


Prior to this, I launched simple twitter bots:


* [DelhiChokes](http://www.twitter.com/DelhiChokes) - hourly updates to Delhi's air pollution levels on twitter.


* [DelhivsWorld](http://www.twitter.com/DelhivsWorld) - hourly updates to Delhi's air pollution levels on twitter.


I definitely don’t have all the answers, but I want to hear your experiences about air pollution and help in any way I can, especially by democratizing air pollution data in a way that's super easy to access and understand for absolutely everyone with an internet connection. 


**Let’s talk air pollution.**  I have a simple question for you: Do you wear a face mask? Why or Why not?

Do you think it is wise for us to stick to that plan or is it better just to leave Delhi right after we land? How do we deal best with the pollution if we stay?

This policy was enacted a few weeks ago. While we have allowed indianews posts in the past, certain actions by their mod team and users have prompted us to cut contact and x-posts from the sub. But for now they are free to proceed on their own. We wish them the best of luck.

We welcome questions about this in this metapost. Any other posts about this will be removed.",brownboy13," [deleted] Well if you guys work with each other it is good.  Witch hunts,  doxxing are shameful acts over an internet forum! I mean, wut? 

Question related to this...  did you folks hijack the penn_masala ama from them?  I know they were asking for questions from visitors..  > Due to the hostile behavior of the mod team of /r/IndiaNews[1] towards /r/India[2] and the attempts to start witchhunts

Examples of said behavior? Stop acting like children everybody. Talk to each other, co-ordinate the AMAs, be nice. For all the high moral opinions that fly around here, is this what we can achieve in the end? 

I think irresponsible behaviour should be reprimanded. But I request the mods of both the subs to fucking talk it out. And /r/india mods you could be transparent about who was banned for what reasons, so that everybody knows [that asshole-ry will not be appreciated.](http://xkcd.com/1357/) 

But think bigger please, what the fuck are you all fighting for exactly? What are you going to win? /r/indianews wants more participation for the AMAs, /r/india wants to participate in the AMAs, so just fucking talk it out!!

Chotte log, chotti soch.


 Good riddance. The subreddit that must not be named is nothing more than a circlejerk for extreme elements whose bigotry isn't tolerated by the mods on /r/India. 

Also, would the mods please be harsher on hate speech here? Good. That subreddit is zehreela. kthxbai Reminds me of the story of India and Pakistan. 

If only, instead of severing of ties, both could work with each other. 

It is unfortunate. But I hope both teams can sort things out, maybe in the future. 

I have heard a little about some of the reasons behind this. No comments on that from my side. Guys let's for once stop being cynical and support our mods. Doxing is not cool at all. >We welcome questions about this in this metapost. Any other posts about this will be removed.

You know that by posting this you are creating more drama. You could have just handled each case individually rather than throwing it up for discussion. The nature of the internet is that you will have trolls and stuff, but you don't need to stoop to their level. Dammit, they were literally among the first 5 subreddits that I had subscribed to. Been amazed with their AMAs. 


But....poaching AMAs or not is another issue. Things like witch hunting is not justifiable under any circumstances. It creates a very unsafe atmosphere and those are the kind of things that have kept me from creating an account here. 


Also, which is the actual twitter handle? I track @RedditIndia and @IndiaReddit


 I know you will act righteous for this, and you believe you are doing the right thing.

But I think /r/india moderation has crossed the limits for me.

I mean wtf? Banning mention of a subreddit. If you really see nothing wrong with this, I'm out of this shit. I'm sure places like even quora are better. At least they don't censor like this.

what the fucking fuck. 

I'm sure you will now ban me for criticizing the moderation. Fuck this shit. My last comment here. (not based on this single rule which you implemented without even informing the community along with many others ). 

goodbye.

**edit:** [This is what I got in PM. what are you even trying to do? wtf?](http://i.imgur.com/UlgCM4g.png) They have the AMAs! Those sell. Not much here after ISRO and one or two others. why so much fight ??? its agood thing to do ,some times they come off as a bad influence .nothing againdt them in person.  Is this post a good place to talk about the hostile behavior of mod team of /r/India? Because it seems the mod team of /r/India has grown extremely intolerant to community criticism. 

This is the same community which the mods want to trot around as having a large Indian community with active participation on reddit. If the mods are intolerant to the community feedback, it defeats the entire purpose.  Honestly, I think this whole post is a conspiracy cooked up by the shady moderating cabal of r/India in response to the steady success of r/Indianews, which is a competing subreddit. Who doesn't hate competition?  Stupid indianews mods banned me. But I don't agree with this decision. India ke itne subreddits, sala sabka neta banna hai! Thanks a lot. As a new user, u introduced me 2 indianews. Also, indiababes! ;) /r/indianews mods.

Guyz, whatever you do, stop trying to doxx these guyz. Not cool man. 

What are you trying to achieve by doing that?  You ~~fucking idiots~~ (I just realized that this is an [R]* thread, I'm sorry about this) and your Internet drama. 24/7 with this pointless shit. Who cares? Why don't you fix this sub-reddit first and then think about e-politics?

**Therefore any comments that do not follow reddiquette will be removed.* How brave, hiding behind this tedious little loophole to protect yourself from criticism. Is this about the Penn Masala AMA? IIRC Penn Masala AMA was supposed to happen on /r/IndiaNews. **The mods of this  sub first release the logs.** To be fair, you also constantly try to steal their AMAs from them. **Attention!** Please keep in mind that the OP of this thread has chosen to mark this post with the **[R]eddiquette Enforced** tag. Therefore any comments that do not follow [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) will be removed.

abhisekh1210 ..redditor for 2 hours  

 Once Priyanka was standing the middle of the road, obstructing the traffic, so a guy walked up to her and asked her, *""Baap ka rasta hain kya?""* Priyanka proudly replied, *""Haan.""* I think that was her PR Team's Plan B. They had to resort to it since *clearly* the AMA aint going very well  so far.  It's hard to distinguish between PCManiacs and PR agencies I don't think it was her team that created these accounts. These are all PCManiacs. Lulz. PC masterrace is going to be delighted.  Wow this is pretty low. I wonder why even agree to do an AMA when you are scared of tough question? She should have stick to mainstream interviews. Randia is fucked. Here come all the Facebook and toi comment section chutiyas  Oh man there was were so many cringeworthy questions and comments from the ""new accounts"". I think there was a huge twitter and facebook influx with questions like ""Do you like Hyderabadi Biryani"" and ""WHat is your dream travel destionation"" and in generatl everyone who called her PC lulz.

But our bakchod brethren saved the day and as I saw this in the morning, I gave my uplingam to everyone! So prod! What a hilarious AMA. This happened with the Madonna's AMA too. It could be just that people wanted to ask her questions that weren't on Reddit yet. No need to get all /r/conspiratard on it. http://www.reddit.com/user/vibhuti94 - Clearly a PR account. Piggy on the railway...piggy got chopped. End of poem. My wife used to work in a company which had a PR agency as a part of it, and they had a few Bollywood clients.   
One of the main tasks was making fake fan tweets/fb posts and building this whole fake fan club. Sometimes I wonder if it was PR work or just ego buildup.

PeeCeeBee should take some tips from Imran Khan before doing this again. But remember guys we hate bollywood and stopped watching those movies years ago!!! Why do we care?? Probably not fake accounts, but accounts created by first time visits through twitter et al. But I'm disgusted by the bullying of Priyanka, and even more disgusted by the fact that people are happy and celebrating that she was bullied. I think there was a lot of hostility showed to her. Some difficult questions were definitely good like the about the road naming and the beauty cream but these were the only top voted questions.

I mean, i'm ok with being friends with exes and all that, but only if it doesn't affect you in a negative way.

A disproportionately high % of prominent journalists in India appear to be coming from particular colleges (and mostly in Delhi University, JNU, Calcutta, Jadavpur etc). Do you think this has created, plausibly inadvertently, a closed-knit group of left-leaning journalists who set the common agenda of discourse?
 Hi Anil,

I hope you don't mind answering few questions which were asked towards Sukumar.

Following was asked by /u/isocialoutcast

1. As compared to Business Line, which is the least neo liberal and left wing pink newspaper, how do you position Mint? 

2. What's your take on some of the biased beliefs of Mint, that are particularly conservative in nature? 

3. The Hindu, being the least biased and the most leftist newspaper out there, how challenging it is to compete with its sub newspaper, given the reputation of the publishing house. 

4. Don't you think that columnist who are writing about stories happening in India, need to live in India for better contribution and more authentic reports? 

5. How is Internet and free news is affecting your revenue, since a large percentage of your target market has Internet connectivity, as compared to readers of other newspapers? 

 Hey Anil, thanks for doing this. 

I have few questions regarding your article selections. 

On what basis and criteria do the articles written by Journalists are screened for publishing?

Are the published articles belong only to in-house journalists or do you do syndication also? 

Is there a scarcity of articles wherein everything is chosen to get published or an over abundance which leads to a good competition on what gets chosen?

 As a matter of fact most newspapers/ journalists have close ties with business leaders/ politicians. How does one maintain integrity in a very damaging story. What kind of pressures does one face? I understand quite a few times such stories are toned down under pressure.

I'm 16 and in the 12th grade, and I really want to be a journalist. Where would you recommend I start?
 You say that under a new leadership there is hope. On the other hand, you voted for NOTA. Why?

Edit: Looks like I'm too late :( Oh No I missed it :(  Sorry to say, this is another farcical AMA. Rather disappointing AMA. No interesting questions asked, no cutting insights offered, and a bland run-of-the-mill discussion overall. Also the way the AMA was set up is also faulty. You can't just set aside a one-hour Q&A session. With reddit, you need to keep going back and forth, and this might take well more than an hour at times. 

How AMA's are usually set up is that there is a liaison who spends time with the person and entire day. Whenever there is any free time, the person is asked to reply to questions or offer rebuttals. That way, you can have a lot more material covered. ",AMA,2014-04-18 17:12:36

Also, their article is rather supportive of Priyanka.

"r/india have you met / spent time with any celebrity. Not just actors, anyone famous...",32,1u5caw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1u5caw/rindia_have_you_met_spent_time_with_any_celebrity/,168,,varuval," This is a true story:

I pee'd standing next to Ratan Tata in Los Angeles. I was at Hyatt reception area for a job interview. While I was waiting for my interviewer to show up, I got up to use the restroom. Standing at the urinal I casually looked to my left and saw this familiar face. It was so unbelievable that as soon as I stepped out I searched for ""Ratan Tata"" google images to confirm it was him. Then I waited for him outside and greeted him when he came out. He replied with a welcoming smile and a handshake. I told the story to my interviewer too!

I got the job too BTW! Spent an entire evening with Rahul Dravid once. Classy cricketer. Classier person. 

Edit: Alright, since you're asking for details, it was in 2012 while he was playing for the Rajasthan Royals. My agency handled some creative duties for the team. So this one time, Dravid had come down to their office in Bandra for a meeting. We thought it would be a good idea to shoot some videos and maybe have a fan interaction of sorts while he was there. My team and I were involved in setting up the whole thing. It was mighty fun. Never have I come across someone humbler than Dravid. He wore a Titan watch goddammit. It was surreal speaking to him. 

There was this other time when I had a similar meeting with Sreesanth as well. Again, while he was with the Royals. Also, this was on his actual birthday. The official one you see on Cricinfo is falsified apparently. We celebrated and I had the honour of having the first bite from his birthday cake. Bonded quite well with him since I was the only other Mallu there.  Spent a whole train journey with Gul Panag. Saw Nandan Nilekani at Forum mall bookshop 7+ years ago. I went wide eyed and ogled him - and he felt my leer and moved away (yes, I have that effect) I hung out with a group of well known telugu actors for around 6 months, almost everyday. I'm not going to name them, but you would know them if you see telugu  movies, they consistently put out 2 movies a year. 

They're spoiled as fuck since they got into the industry through their parents, everyone around them are yes men. Their entourage's are even more pathetic, initially when I met them, I thought they were friends of the actors but a week later I noticed, they're just the actor's slaves. These guys come from the rural areas and look for a break into movies. They carry cigarettes, they're the drivers, they're bodyguards, they hang out with him. Once I saw a guy remove dog shit because the actor told him. One of the actors used to get pissed off when the other person didn't pick up the phone. He asked me once why I didn't pick up my phone, I gave a weird stare and shrugged. 

It's very weird, their lifestyle is very different from ours. They have an incredible amount of free time, they just drink, shop and screw when they're not shooting. Girls for them are more or less a given, it's like they have an infinite amount of supply and they don't even try. They all have a small guest house in a remote part of Hyderabad, they call it the ""office"", but trust me, no work goes on here. It's more of a sex pad. Like one day, one of the actor calls me up and tells me to get couple of girls to the office, he said each guy is bringing 2 girls to the office, he said the plan for the night was a orgy. Obviously I didn't go but I heard stories of the night for the next week. I think there were 3 dudes and 5 girls that night. And once the entourage wanted to screw a girl there, his ""boss"" didn't like it, so the guy was no longer in his entourage. 

I went to an actors first day of shoot, the muhurat function. The actor introduced me to the heroine and after she left, he told me he banged her the previous day. One of the actors was trying really hard for Tamanna, he went out of his way to have sex with her, I heard she didn't put out and this guy was disappointed. 

Another time, this actor and his entourage were going to a party when this car swerved infront of them, the actor chased the car down and broke his window. The entourage was held responsible and the actor got out scott free. 

And for these guys, money is like fucking water, it's very very expendable. 

Initially they were really nice to me, they treated me like a friend. After a bit, they started taking liberties with me, they once tried bossing over me, and they tried to treat me like their entourage. I'm no ones entourage and had to put them in place, they didn't try again. After around 6 months, I got busy with my professional life and we drifted apart and I ignored them. We still meet once in a while but not close anymore.  Evening with David Mulford, the US ambassador to India then, at a tea party. Spent one hour with debaters election commissioner Krishnamurthi, he is so humble. Several meetings with Arundhati Roy when I was a commie. My first meeting with Yasin Malik when I asked for his autograph in my notebook, lol. Meeting Shashi Tharoor at St. Stephens college. Hand shaking with Ashutosh Rana despite his unwillingness, I was shit scared he would slap me for this. 

And the worst, Barkha dutt's house is close to my office, quite often I have to see her ugly face.  My friend is an upcoming actor in the tamil flim industry. We sit together and gossip about all the actresses and who they are shagging.  I talked to envia & neoronin once via PM. It was good. Actor Vikram. Frequents this gym I know. Guy doesn't come in the same car two days straight.  Handshake with [Richard Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) once Met Karl Pilkington once.. Got a lot of Karma...

 Not met anyone.

But when Arvind Kejriwal and Anna Hazare were arrested during Jan Lokpal moment ,I was staying in a flat right bellow Kejriwals flat. 

As they were about to be arrested,I remember my uncle telling me to stay indoor. I tried to open the door when one havildar quickly asked me to shut it and stay inside.

For next week ,atmosphere in that society in Mayur Vihar was absolutely tight. Infact ,one evening while returning home ,I saw entire society being surrounded by AAP supporters and when asked by watchman where I am goin ,I told him the building number where Kejriwal lived(&was arrested that morning). The watchman simply refused to let me in thinking I am AAP supporter.

The lead singer of Indian rock band Junkyard Groove is one of my best friends. He gets hounded for autographs and pictures at their bigger shows so I guess he's kinda famous in the music scene. I even directed a music video for one of their songs.

 [deleted] I was a part time waiter during my college days and waited table for David Axelrod. He is a pretty calm and nice person. Didn't get a chance to talk to him other than taking his order and I wasn't sure who he was until he left but had a feeling that he was some big shot as all the people at other table were staring at him. He may not be a celebrity as OP is hoping but He was the only big shot kind of person I met. Not me but my father met Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad when they were in Rajkot for a match. Invited them for rice and rasam but they politely declined. 

Edit: I think it was against West Indies, not sure. Narendra Modi, numerous times. Paresh Rawal, at his house. Possibly more; can't think of anyone right now. Met quite a few Indian band musicians. Rock and fusion.  I've met Ashok Gehlot (ex-CM of Rajasthan) a few times. Even after the recent elections which he lost Met the fat guy from masterchef australia. Played darts with Naseeruddin Shah. Have played against current national no 1 TT sharath kamal during my school days. I sang for Vishal Dadlani once. Didn't want to. Also Anu Malik, and his brother Daboo. It didn't go anywhere.

Drashti Dhami is a good friend of one of my college friends. Met her in Dallas in 2004 and again at my friend's wedding in 2006. She is so beautiful and very sweet.

Brief conversation with Meenakshi Sheshadri once; she told me I sang well :)

The guy who lived across the street from me in school won a Pulitzer in photojournalism in 2005.

I tutored a kid in high school too named Jordan Malone who won the bronze medal in speed skating in the 2010 Olympics. Never saw someone more single-mindedly focused on anything in my life. Once I met rahul ji he came to visit ma house and have eaten chapati with me. /s I met ileana at an event in hyderabad.I also have photo with my cousins with her.

I met telugu director shekhar kammula and an actor who acted in his film too.

 1. Randomly met Ajay Jadeja and Ashish Nehra chilling outside their house with their WAGS. I was in that area visiting someone.

2. Nawazuddin Siddiqui (of GoW and Lunch box fame) was sitting alongside me in a flight once. Spoke quite a lot since it was a 16 hour long flight. Very humble and down-to-earth guy.

3. Met Dharmendra, Sunny paaji and Bobbyyjeee at a wedding once.  stalked Glen Hansard(from the Movie 'Once' and the band 'Swell Season') over 2 terminals at JFK for about an hour while he was on the phone, to get a picture. Ended up having a good 20-30 min conversation with him about his work, India etc. Wife and I once skype'd with Hiten Tejwani

Should've asked to get me a singing role in a film.  Met Shekhar Kapoor and Venkatesh Prasad near my work locaion in Bangalore. Shekhar Kapoor is a legend and I was happy to have small conversation with him. 
Venki met suddenly, with his nice fluffy dog. And it was so cute, I forgot Venki. :D Met Kejriwal for an IT case... he was a bloody asshole.

Respect++ He is choosing a book for reading To be honest, I did not know of your existence until today. ""Punjabi"" ""music"" has been so Hindi-ized, converted into some kind of stunt and turned into a rap style with gangster (and misogynistic) overtones, while its history and potential deserves so much better. I have not listened to a Punjabi folk singer after Surinder Kaur.

My knowledge of you is limited to the Wikipedia entry. I have never listened to any of your music (which is something I plan to correct soon). I am curious about your view of which way Punjabi music is headed. I ask only because you seem to hearken back to some of its roots and not the modern-trash-speak-Hindi-roughly-and-people-will-think-its-Punjabi nonsense.

Do you see other people like you breaking out of this morass? Seems like a really nice, interesting, well-read guy. I really did enjoy his AMA. But how do I tell him that I am not particularly fond of his music, his voice, his punjabi diction, or his interpretation of Bulleh Shah?

**Paradise Papers: Questions raised, Hindujas took trust route to waive debt to group company** 

 ______ 
Appleby called them ‘some of the most powerful’ in world. Appleby called them ‘some of the most powerful’ in world.

The Hinduja Group, with revenues of over $25 billion and employing 100,000-plus people, effectively utilised a “trust” structure and its opaqueness to waive over $78 million in debt to a group holding company despite the trustees pointing out that the act would benefit the Hinduja family members, Appleby records show.

Initially hesitant to sign off on the holding company’s accounts, the trustees, eventually, agreed after extracting an indemnity bond from Prakash Hinduja protecting them from any future damages. Legal advice stating that the waiver of the debt would not be construed as an aggressive tax-avoidance scheme was also furnished to the trustees.

Records show that documentation of the loan was created between June 30, 2007 and December 3, 2007. Appleby had pointed out, records investigated by The Indian Express show, that once the loan was waived by the Hinduja family trust called The Acorn Trust, the holding company, headquartered in Luxembourg, AMAS Holding SPF, would recognise the profit in its financial statements.

This profit would be available to be distributed to the shareholders. AMAS Holding’s entire shareholding is with The Acorn Trust whose beneficiaries are the Hinduja family.

In the case of Hinduja Group, Appleby worked during 2014-15 to replace Jersey-based Rozel Trustees (Channel Islands) Limited and Novatrust Ltd as the trustee for The Acorn Trust. This information came to light because the takeover got delayed and “frustrating” for the Hinduja Group, with existing trustees creating a demand for an indemnity for the loan waiver. In email exchanges, both the Hinduja Group and Appleby guess this might have been the case as they to expedite the process.

On May 12, 2015, Appleby facilitated setting up of another trust, The Pine Trust, for the Hinduja family. The beneficiaries of the trust are Ajay P Hinduja, Kamal P Hinduja, Sareeta S Hinduja, Sadhna Gopichand Hinduja, Sanjay Gopichand Hinduja, Dheeraj Gopichand Hinduja, Vinoo Srichand Hinduja and Shanu Hinduja. The protector for this trust is also Protectus Anstalt, the same as that for The Acorn Trust.

In its internal file notings, Appleby said: “Hinduja brothers remain some of the most powerful people in the world linked with US Presidents and numerous US politicians — hence linking PK as a PEP,” it said. According to a statement from the office of P P Hinduja, Chairman, Hinduja Group of Companies (Europe), received today: “The Hinduja Family, descendant of late P D Hinduja, comprises mostly of members who are overseas citizens of Indian origin for almost 100 years. They have global investments in multiple jurisdictions. They are fully compliant with the laws and regulations in each geography where they operate.”

Information collated from various exchange of mails and records show that The Acorn Trust, set up on June 14, 1990, sits at the top of the Hinduja Group’s structure. It came formally under the Appleby fold in January 2015 (there is a letter of engagement dated January 22, 2015 to the trustees of the Acorn Trust spelling out the basis to provide services). Its settlor is Prakash Parmanand Hinduja, the third of the four Hinduja brothers. Its beneficiaries are relatives of the four brothers – Srichand, Gopichand, Prakash and Ashok.

EXPLAINED: Why the Paradise Papers matter

A Liechtenstein foundation, Protectus Anstalt, is the Protector of the Trust. The Trustees are Rozel Trustees (Channel Islands) Limited. The Trust’s only unlisted investment is in AMAS Holding SPF, which is fully subscribed to by the trust. The Acorn Trust holds 10,000 shares of CHF 400 each, amounting to $346,330 at cost. It has $124.41 million in the capital account, also termed as ‘Beneficiaries Funds’.

Records show that Prakash Hinduja, born in Mumbai, is a Swiss national, but a Monaco tax resident. Srichand and Gopichand are UK citizens, and Ashok is an Indian citizen. There is huge to-and-fro within the Appleby compliance team about the status of the Hinduja brothers, but eventually, they settle to term the whole family as PEPs (Politically Exposed Persons). Records show the holding structure of the group’s flagship in India — Ashok Leyland Ltd, the country’s second largest commercial vehicle manufacturer after Tata Motors. It also has other interests in sectors such as oil, power, banking and finance, etc.

SEE PHOTOS | Paradise Papers: Here are the Indians on the list

The umbrella investment company for all its Indian ventures is also AMAS Holding SPF. SPF essentially is in the nature of a Private Asset Management Company. SPFs can hold financial investments – shares, bonds and derivative instruments. They cannot take part in commercial transactions.

SPFs obviously have huge tax advantages. They do not pay corporation tax, municipal tax or wealth tax. Further, they do not have to pay capital gains tax or withholding tax on interest payments.

There is no clear picture about the value of the entire investments or holdings of AMAS Holding SPF. AMAS Holding SPF holds 100 per cent of Machen Development Corporation, a Panamanian entity, which in turn holds 100 per cent of N.N.Investments B.V., a Netherlands company.

Both these companies, too, are holding/ investment companies, with no other commercial activity. The shareholding of Machen Development Corporation is 100 shares which were transferred to AMAS Holding SPF of Luxembourg on April 22, 2014. MDC initially had ‘Bearer’ shares allotted on March 3, 1986.

The second mega layer in the The Acorn Trust super-structure is Gulf Oil International Ltd (GOIL), another holding company in Cayman Islands. The shareholding in GOIL is split between AMAS Holding SPF (56.4%) and N.N.Investments (43.6%). All the Gulf Oil brand companies across the world including India, UK, Middle East — except the US, where the Hindujas sold Gulf Oil to Chevron a while ago – seem to be under this Cayman Islands company.

I'm a Syrian-Christian. Ask Me Anything.,71,cnx0jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cnx0jb/im_a_syrianchristian_ask_me_anything/,174,"I'm a Syrian-Christian Malayali who wants to answer any questions you can ask, from any and every corner of India. AMA

Denominational questions highly encouraged!",simsim1000," How does your church came to be? I mean what is the story behind it? 


Also does all sects of christianity have a fascination for conversion or its just few? What are the key differences between your church and the traditional catholic churches? Just language or are there any other core beliefs that differ? What is the difference between a regular (Catholic/Protestant...) and Syrian Christian? What are some some cliches that are used for Syrian Christian ? like we think Sikhs and Rajputs are brave, Brahmins are smart Muslims are violent something like these..are there any such prejudice/assumption about you. I don't know if I am making any sense. So if I understand correctly, your ancestry is more or less completely indigenous to India but you follow the canon of the church of Syria, correct? 1. What interesting historical/cultural places related to your particular denomination do you recommend visiting? Churches / monasteries / tombs / museums in Kerala or outside.
2. Any book recommendations regarding your people's history? Are you a religious person? Or just a cultural person? Is there a sizeable jewish population in Kerala? What's some must try food in your community? I want to convert to Latvian orthodoxy. I have too much 'kavorka'. what language do you prefer for prayers ?

Edit: Also want to know if Syrian Christian would want to go their roots and settle in Syria as this is the case for many region based minorities. Like in US there is a group of Zoroastrian who wants to settle in Iran mountain. Share that beef recipe bro അളിയാ! നാട്ടിൽ എവിടെയാ? I hope I'm not too late, but I stayed with a Syrian Christian family in Kochi with whom I don't have regular contact. They made me a lamb moilee with appams for brunch one morning and it is amongst the best meals I've had in my life. I need that recipe please, can you help? Syrian Christian food that I tried is by far and away some of the best Indian cuisine out there.

Also noted that the family I stayed with spoke of how they trace their conversion all the way back to Apostle Thomas' arrival and still observe some Hindu like practices. Very cool to learn how old the community is! Hi Simsim1000, Malayali of moplah background here.

My cursory knowledge of Kerala Christianity is through wiki surfing and the occasional interaction with my friends in the community. So, I have several questions that I never got satisfactorily answered before, hope I can ask them here:


1.	Is the Chaldean Christian community in Kerala considered part of Syrian Chrisitian Community , or is it completely separate? How different are they, and is there some overlap?
2.	When someone says they belong to Marthoma Church, do they mean the older St Thomas tradition, or something else?
3.	The history of the Kerala Christians church traditions are so rich and varied. For an outsider like me, it is difficult to get a grasp of the different rites/denominations/churches. Is it the same for someone within the church? If I were to ask the average joe/jane on the street, would he/she know only their churches history? Or would they have some knowledge about the other branches? Is this something you learn in your respective liturgical classes?
4.	May I ask if your head of the church resides in India, or the Middle East? How is the relationship between the practitioners in that country and the Kerala church? What's your opinion on gifts of the holy spirit/ speaking in tongues? Do you understand the Syriac language? What is your denomination ? On a scale of 10, where would you rate the Appam + More Kozhambu dish made in a Syrian-Christian home? Mate it's raining pretty heavily out there. Are you safe? Is Syriac a language that is in everyday use anywhere? 

Have you ever met an actual Syrian?  An actual Syrian Christian.

How are your beliefs different from say, a Catholic.

Do you have any rituals/traditions/food that connect back to your ancient land.. Do you believe in Jesus Christ as the son of God? Thanks for the diversity awareness exercise. It's a great thought. Wish more redditors from marginalized communities came forward with their own AMAs. I'm an atheist and I'm unable to grasp why any educated and rational being should just believe in imaginary constructs at a day and age where it's so easy to debunk or disprove them. Why are you religious? Hey, I’m also Syriac Christian! Living in US rn, but in India, I went to malecuriz dayro. What about you? Why do you have seperate churches for lower castes in Kerala? There is a main church and a small church in almost every place? Why is casteism still prevalent among Syrian-Catholics? Yup , just read somewhere today that ISIS has  resurfaced in Syria once again ..were they ever curtailed ? ..Nd if possible can u shed some light on the Syrian civil war .with regards to  the timeline  .. Do you feel Ravi Shastri should continue as the coach? [removed] You mean a normal malayali christian? What are the different Kerala Churches within Syrian-Christian Framework? Let me ask the important question! Why are Syrian-Christians so hot? So in your opinion it is normal and justifiable since it is Indian. I have seen people even the kids from sy-x families calling names of people in 80s who are low caste, there are seperate burial areas for the so called original syrian-xtians and low castes....all in the name of god and nowhere in the bible mentions about caste disparity or the xtians should follow the heirarchy. Do you support casteism? [removed] [removed]",AMA,2019-08-09 12:00:22
Just met Sachin Pilot and wanted to share my experience.,40,2x9bjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2x9bjd/just_met_sachin_pilot_and_wanted_to_share_my/,50,"I met him just a few minutes ago. My dad works at some sort of government hotel which is mostly used by politicians. So, most of the politicians I meet are arrogant (to some extent) and usually don't talk much (Sushma Swaraj for example). I also met Anna Hazare a couple of years ago and not to mention, he was even more arrogant than politicians.

Anyways, this guy was super cool and friendly.When I approached him, he offered me a firm handshake. He even told me that I have an over-complicated phone unlock pattern (which was true :) ). I wanted to take a selfie but I don't think he likes em so he told his P.A. to take a picture of us. I also told him about reddit and asked him if he could do an AMA here. I told him that many famous people have done AMAs including celebrities and politicians, and damn he threw a bouncer. He asked me to name a few politicians and I couldn't remember name of even one Indian politician who has done an AMA here. So I said I can't recall name of any politician but I told him about the recent AMA of Roy's director and also about other famous AMAs. He said he'll think about it. 

Personally, I believe he's a nice guy and I've always been a fan of him. He's one of the few guys that are responsible for the survival of Congress. I believe we need more young politicians like him.

For the guys who don't know him, from wikipedia:

> Son of a senior politician Rajesh Pilot, he became the youngest Member of Parliament in the country at the age of 26. Pilot was a Member of the Lok Sabha's Standing Committee on Home Affairs and Member of the Consultative Committee in the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

>  In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, he defeated Bharatiya Janata Party's Kiran Maheshwari by a margin of 76,000 votes and won the seat of Ajmer.

>  In the 2014 Lok sabha elections, he was again nominated from the Ajmer constituency.Pilot, sitting MP from Ajmer, was defeated by a margin of 1,71,983 votes by Bharatiya Janata Party's sitting MLA Sanwarlal Jat.


P.S.: I guess I'd also get a chance to meet our President Pranab Mukherjee on 3rd of March, so if I meet him, I'd definitely request him to do an AMA here. ",xEpic," Highly unlikely for the President to do an AMA right now at this stage. I would love Abdul Kalam saar to do the AMA Dude, next politician you meet, tell them even Barack Obama has done an AMA. Happy for you. But saddened to hear that all it takes is a casual chat and selfie to win our hearts. Point noted. ;) Dude he's, at the end of the day, a product of dynasty. And decades of corruption. Six or seven years ago he came to our university and girls were going crazy on him. He is dashing but I cannot say if he is good politician. His arguments are often shallow. I liked Rajesh Pilot though. He was one good politician.  Sachin pilot jee is one true to the congress ideology. He is one person you can admire
  > Personally, I believe he's a nice guy and I've always been a fan of him. He's one of the few guys that are responsible for the survival of Congress. I believe we need more young politicians like him.

Name the politician you dislike and you will like him too if he/she attends to you and talks to you nicely for a few minutes.  JustSaying.

On a funny note, you can keep a check on politicians on who they meet at hotel ;)
I don't trust media for any reporting on this because they are not ""journalists"".
 Sachin Pilot is doing a lot of good work for congress at grass root leven in rajasthan. Expect him to get higher berth in congress once rahul gandhi is appointed congress president in april. Fanboi self post. >He's one of the few guys that are responsible for the survival of Congress. I believe we need more young politicians like him.

Umm..No! We need the exact opposite of him. FOr eg, Rahul baba. better you should ask someone from President's office/team to do an AMA. President is unlikely to do it.  You could at least have said that Obama has done an AMA ;D I don't know dude, you know what wise men say

> If you want to test a man's character, give him power  You could have just talked about Obama doing an AMA. Doesn't matter, he gets the point of it being an important forum Once upon a time, I, Sachin Pilot and his PA were on a flight together to Delhi - only 3 of us in business class. Fucking Jet Airways got him a special car from plane to the terminal and I had to wait for the bus to fill in before I was transported to the terminal. Worst 10 minutes ever.  I would go with Scindia scion next. As much as I hate Comgress, that chap looks sensible.

The Briton who is cleaning up India | There is a reason Jodie Underhill is called the 'garbage girl',91,2p2f92,http://www.rediff.com/news/special/the-briton-who-is-cleaning-up-india/20141211.htm,49,,rahulthewall," On the train yesterday, the couple sititng on the window seat did not miss one single chnace to throw their chai cups while passing over rivers. A pile of peanut (husks ??) and a load of food leftovers. And when my co passenger asked them to clean up, the lady replied- ""agli station mein those sweepers will do it. You chill.""

While our blood boiled. Who will tell them to dispose their garbage responsiblily? The couple was educated newly married couple speaking mostly in English.
 Loved this article.

> Struggling to raise funds and at times confronted with local governmental indifference, working with garbage hasn't been easy for Underhill. It also elicits prejudice. She was once reported as a prostitute to the Foreigners Registration Office because residents disapproved of her living with two sweepers and her clean-up rounds in a cycle rickshaw.

fucking idiot residents. Her organisation, WasteWarriors, has done a tremendous job in Dehradun. You can find them on facebook.  Gori mems are busy cleaning India and our Indian mems are busy garbaging our streets ! I saw her on Nat Geo. Great woman and great work. Ive been to two swacch bharat abhiyaans. clicked no photos.cleaned the street. will do again. GOD if u are reading this comment then plz for your sake do an akashvaani (not the A.I.R one but real one) and order all these countless morons that they are living on a planet not some ""throw away all your garbage and it will vanish magic land"" and if they keep polluting mother nature like this then they'll all be dead soon and most importantly their soul will not find any place in heaven... might that induce some fear at least in all those moksha seekers which btw are lot.

And Kudos to this selfless, nature loving, philanthropist lady...  I hope whoever read this article try to control his/her habit of littering (if they have any), at least redditors on /r/india should. hey...

i met her, a year ago, 
i talked to her about what this,
its not about garbage...or pullution...

Do you sell your posters online and ship outside India ? I really want to buy Parvaaz poster  * How do bands/clients find you? Word of mouth/web marketing/agency?

* What tools do you use?  Keep it up. Designing album cover for God(Opeth) is a noble thing Hi Anoop, 

So whats up ? Hey Anoop! Awesome to see you doing an AMA. 

* What is your process in making artwork for bands? How do you start, make the concept? 

* How do you understand what the bands want? Are bands always happy with what they get? (I'm sure they are, but curious to see if anyone actually didn't like something)

* I've followed your work for about a year now. You seem to be very inspired by nature and foliage. How do you draw inspiration from this and apply it to music?


 Hey Anoop, terribly late for the party. But I would really appreciate if you can answer these for me.

1. What pen/pencil do you use n where to buy them in India?

2. How do you create original art?

3. How do you monetize your work? Any tips for amateurs.

4. Your personal take on getting into digital platform, I went into inkspace n even bought a wacom when I was broke. But still nowhere.

Keep up the good work, your art looks sick. I've been doing some using usual pen on silly papers, but not yet in any position to make anything original :( Hi! I'm an architecture student who loves designing logos and illustrations in free time!

So my question would be, how do you exactly balance between being an architect and an illustrator? Does one hinder with the other? And do you personally enjoy doing both?

Thank you! Hey Anoop, I just saw your website, incredible work! 

I loved to draw as a kid and used to do it all the time. At some point, I discovered DeviantArt and saw all the brilliant work there and became quite self-critical. That combined with the distraction of the internet, I have practically stopped drawing. But I really want to get back to it. Any advice for me?  What is your favorite indian band and why is it death by fungi Tell us about your work with Opeth! (I love that band)

What kind of music do you like?

What tools do you use for designing? Hi there! As a guy who hasn't drawn anything in 15 years, but was quite an artist in his younger days, and wants to draw again, where should I start from? Thanks. :) Can we buy any of your original drawings online or through orders?  Would you design a tattoo? Hello, really good job you did with your art. BTW, have you ever played Computer Games? And if yes, which one and when? Have a good night. Do you think you could ever replace your workflow with an iPad Pro with Pencil and some App(I can’t think of any apps off the top of my head). I recently read a report of a font design studio that completely switched to iPads.  Did you do the prints that Parvaaz released recently? Hey, nice to see AMA of fellow Indian.

How did you enter this profession and how did you saw it through?
 Woah. Amazing work!. 

I envy your talent.  Which album cover did you do for Anathema ? I love that band! You said you started this while in college but if it's okay, could you go into detail on how it went along? Did you join any professional course(s) or was this something you simply picked up and practice (like maybe some articles/books or DeviantArt tutorials) made perfect.
Keep up the good work. Hi Anoop, is there a band for whom you haven't designed a cover yet, but would love to?  Just checked out your work and wanted to say that I'm a fan of your work. Really love the Ant thema artwork. Hello, great work! 

Who are you working with as an architect in Bangalore?
Do you ever plan to shift to graphics completely?
I see there’s a healthy environment for designers and freelance artists is Bangalore, what do you feel?

Thankyou! Gift me a spare inkpen. Why don’t you try colour painting?

Where were you born and brought up? Hi Anoop!

In the comments a user had [requested an AMA of how it feels to be an LGBT person in India](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2audow/an_outrageous_case_of_homophobia/ciyx95g). I thought it was great idea and contacted a gay friend of mine, Shankar Ganesh. He is an openly gay man and [in December of 2013, came out publicly on Facebook in the most boss way possible](https://medium.com/@_shankarganesh/coming-out-6f6a6c2f1139). That post went viral, and got over a thousand likes and more than a hundred shares. He agreed to do an AMA and when I asked him if he would like to remain anonymous, he surprised my by saying no, and would like an open discussion. 

[Here's an article by him, ""Being a gay teenager in India"".](https://medium.com/@_shankarganesh/being-a-gay-teenager-in-india-91e8ea58463)

His AMA is at 9 PM this Sunday on /r/india.",palakkadan," I really look forward to this AMA.  Just in case it gets hijacked by morons, my one question is this:

While homosexuality was illegal/frowned upon in the US and many other western countries, there were so many high profile people, mainly artists, who were openly gay.  That helped a lot in bringing the issue out in the open and in the mindspace of everyone.  A lot of TV serials and movies were made about being gay, and showing gay people doing regular stuff (i.e. the gay part was downplayed or not a big deal).  Why is this not happening in India?  (I mean imagine if for e.g. Salman Khan came out.) Where are our openly gay public figures?

I think that several of the revolutions that have happened out west have passed India completely.  We did not see the industrial revolution happen, we did not see major wars - which meant we did not see women doing the work that men typically did, there was never a sexual revolution, etc.  Somewhere we are just imitating the west, without having gone through the process or having learnt any lessons. I think its refreshingly brave and strong of him to be able to do the AMA, I look forward to a heart to heart. I did like that video that he posted on the blog about choosing to be gay or straight, i think its something people tend to overlook much too easily.  Good stuff! >I Am A, where the mundane becomes fascinating and the outrageous suddenly seems normal.

*Quoting from IAMA's title*

Stop being judgmental fucks before the AMA

 Nice! Should be insightful! Thanks. Way to go buddy ! Looking forward to this. Awesome. His blog is pretty fun to read as well. > So, on 14 December 2013, I came out on Facebook. More than a thousand people liked the post, and over a hundred people shared it.

Where can I find that facebook status ? more pussy for me!  Why do we have to make a celebrity out of every gay person who comes out?

Why would anyone apart from his friends and family care about him being gay? Inb4 *""it gives other gays confidence to come out"".* It's so presumptuous to think that people will care about someone being gay.

Just like no one posts about being straight, no one should make a big deal about being gay. Gay, straight, bi-sexual - they're all the same. If people want to be treated normally, they should act normally, instead of making a huge scene about their every movement, and other people thinking of them as some kind of a martyr.

>a thousand likes and more than a hundred shares.

It doesn't matter. I wonder how many dislikes it would have gotten had there been an option to dislike it. Or how many ""indifferent"" clicks it would have gotten. I'm surprised it's still such a big deal to be gay. ""I am gay, AMA"" really?

Be gay be happy, I'm going to skip this AMA. No offense meant but I mean, come on... Another point -

From his webpage -

>This is my privilege, and my burden. So, I’m going to do it. **Like a boss.**

How full of himself is he? He follows it up with -

>So, it’s time. Many of you are going to hate me after I write this up. Some of you are not going to talk to me after this note, but that’s just fine. Some of you bigots are not even going to like this post.

The whole thing is so cringe-worthy. Of course, that calls for an AMA on /r/India.

And a thousand likes and hundred shares are not ""viral"" by any means in this day and age. We already have a gay user here ashu [deleted]",AMA,2014-07-18 15:32:20

All four would be available to answer your questions. 

Check out their youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZTeXnY6LeA2poDPh2dMTnQ 
",rahulthewall," At the first glance , I thought  ""Indian with a mental (bipolar) disorder"" was the name of the band. In my defense, band names are weird. Not to take anything away from the band, but if I form a group tomorrow and put out an album, am I also eligible for an AMA? Huge Mushroom Lake Fan here. Great to see that they'll be having an AMA! Seems like pink floyd inspired, but which psychedelic band isn't. Good Music Discussing drugs in this sub makes me so paranoid! I have a feeling the Indian narcs eyeball this sub time to time. Sounds irrational but who knows.... AMA of person with bipolar disorder sounds interesting..

Sorry, but never heard of this band. They sound okayish :/

Guys what happened to Raghu Dixit AMA..? It took me 5 minutes and I still don't get it. Anybody here want to break it down for me?

What I have understood: AMA by the band who are Bipolar diagnosed.

(Couldn't open the youtube link) i want to share information related to bipolar disorder , i read an informative article related to that http://medicaldice.com/health/bipolar-disorder/ ... all the best readers >Indian with Mental(Bipolar) Disorder

I believe it was mentioned by Newslaundry that his contract doesn't allow him to give interviews. I guess an AMA would also fall under the same category.  Times won't let him do it. Newslaundry said that they tried to get him for an interview but the parent corporation had strict rules against any journalists doing interviews.

The first AMA is going to be done by a Clinical Pscyhologist, who has chosen to remain anonymous [Mod Verified] She will be answering questions related to mental health issues and related topics. She has completed her Masters in Clinical psychology and currently pursuing higher qualifications in the same field. She works primarily in the mental health setup and regularly caters to patients with various mental health conditions.

The second AMA is by the famous Cartoonist Aseem Trivedi scheduled between 6-7 PM. ",neoronin," Mods the title is kind of confusing because it seems as if Aseem Trivedi is a clinical psychologist and a cartoonist. Upon reading through the content it became clear that it is two different people.

Congrats for some super AMAs lined up. Looking forward to them.

Edit: Word The first AMA should also be crossposted on subs like r/depression & related subs. 

Guys use throwaways if you have issues with anonymity.  In India disease like depression & other psychological illnesses have been treated as taboo, people don't want to share it with anyone thinking it'll spoil their image socially,but discussing it might be helpful.That to be on AMA & with a clinical psychologist is wonderful.
 /r/titlegore  A big thank you to the mods for making these awesome AMA's possible.



Edit: Please make this stickied seem's like i have to make a different account for psychology. Whom do you regard as the best thinker in your field? freud jung? whom Aseem trivedi needs a clinical psychologist  [deleted] >clinical psychologist

Can you convince him to do an AMA? He has listed out his experiences with the people of each state. He has nice things to say about each state except delhi.

1) Why did he do this ?

2) Best part ..& worst part ?

3) Was language an issue ? 

4) Best meal ? He's a champ! 
1) Where in Kashmir did you start? 

2) How did you decide which cities/towns you'll visit? I guess you'd need to find routes where there are safe places to sleep at night and these generally need local input. I am curious how you planned it. 

3) What did you carry with you? How much did the entire trip cost?

4) On an average, how much distance did you cover in a day? Did you make any overdue stops if you particularly liked a place?

 Damn! I'm sooooo envious. Well done, young man! India needs more adventurous souls like you. Amazing achievement. And he looks like Pi Patel by now. This is something I have dreamed of doing since my childhood, so I am a bit jealous.

A well deserved Congrats to him, though.

I'm a bisexual guy in an interracial (punjab/Manipur) relationship with a gay guy in India. Ask me anything.

Also, LGBT people of randia please come out and help with this ama with your own experiences. I want to see how many of us are here. ",okashii_person," I think it is easier for gay/lesbian couples to find a rented house for a live-in relationship when compared to heterosexual couples, is it true?

Do you make out with your partner in rest rooms of restaurants or airports etc?

How eagerly are you waiting for supreme court decision on decriminalisation of homosexuailty? Do you think it matters?

What gel do you use for anaal?

 What's more difficult holding his hand in public or engineering ? Gay guy with inter racial relationship?  Aunty Ji ki heart attack aa jayega :(  1. Do you know Japanese?

2. Do you seriously like the rainbow flag?

3. Do you still use grindr (if you used to earlier)?

4. How did you meet your boyfriend? Did he have any issues with you being bi?

5. How did you realise you are ~~gay~~ bi?

6. Do you think it's easier to have sex with a girl cause I think so. I haven't yet had sex yet but it looks more flexible in porn.

 [deleted] After a blowing a guy friend if you we do not say nohomo in fifteen minutes are we legally allowed to be gay? [deleted] What are some struggles of being secretly Gay which straight people cannot know ? 

What feature in guys / girls that Gay people look into that straight couples do not ? Does size matter in Gay community?

Bit of a funny question, is there a gaydar? Being one yourself Can you guess if someone is maybe gay? Ever had that feeling?

 Hey OP, how do you do?

Wanted to know if you live in a city, and if yes, how different would it be for you and your partner if you were living somewhere more rural/conservative? A When did you discover you were a bisexual ?  Do you have any straight friends to whom you've come out to? Close friends? 

Also, these straight friends, do they hit you with casual gay jokes? I mean, joke around with you about your sexual orientation but in good spirits. I personally think that nothing is off limits while joking. So, if I had been your friend I would've constantly joke about it.

So, sorry in advance if we meet in future!! This may not be in good taste but how's the sex scene going for you guys? Who is the car and who is the garage?  1) Do you get attracted towards girls?

2) Usually sex lasts for like 30 mins max. What about rest of the 22 hours 30 mins of the day?

3) Spitter or Swallower?

4) Best threesome scenario for you, MMM or MMF?

5) Favorite musician? whats the most hilarious gay joke you have heard? 17 year old gay guy here, if anybody wanna ask anything~

Any transgender here btw? [deleted] I've so many questions.

* Have you fucked a girl in the ass? Is it any difference from guy? What are the differences?

* Have you fucked a girl's pussy? Do like or don't like it?

* Have you ever considered using a male prostitute to spice up your sessions?

* Is there a way that you can tell if a guy is homo or not? Have you had negative experiences about people judging you for being different ? 

Also, I am not sure if its offensive, but I remember this joke by Russel Peters. 

It went something like seeing the population of the world/India, we could actually benefit with gay couples. 

Hopefully, things go well and people see  you guys as people in love and not hate you for having different thoughts.  1. Have you ever met a transman (ie. FtM) in India? 
2. In the west, the consensus is that a woman in relationship with a transwomen is a lesbian and a man is straight. How does the Indian LGBT community feel about this?
3. (not to you specifically, I hope someone trans can answer) Is it possible to get medically supervised HRT in India? Another question I forgot to ask:

How would you rank the following in terms of pleasure: PIV sex, anal sex-giving, anal sex-recieving ? How supportive are the people around you? ",AMA,2018-04-19 16:04:20

Hey,

**Account** This is a throwaway account cause I am still part of the industry and would like to continue doing so but still reveal and answer your questions.

**Proof:** I don't know how I can provide proof without revealing myself, I guess you will have to just trust me.

**Goal**: I am sure you have some questions about the life and the happenings of bollywood. Shoot away and I will try to answer them the best way I can, and if I don't know something I will let you know that too.

*Rule* - Don't be vulgar or crass about it, I will avoid vulgar questions. Gossipy, normal questions are fine but anything vulgar will be avoided. 

Fire away the questions and let's get started.

Edit: Guys if you ask generic questions, I will have to give generic answers.. Ask more specific questions. Thanks

**mod** If any mod wants to verify that is fine with me too. 

",throwawayforsec2," Are you Priyanka Chopra because you havent answered any questions yet lol Is Salman Bhai™ really a virgin? Are most Superstars aware that the mainstream Bollywood masala flicks they act in have no artistic/cultural value and serve only to make the producers and investors rich, if yes do any of them feel any remorse for being such sell-outs? > *Rule* - Don't be vulgar or crass about it, I will avoid vulgar questions.

How did you deal with the buffoons in the CBFC? Scoopwhoop/Buzzfeed writers, nothing juicy here go away. Come again other AMA How bad is drug scene in film industry? How common is promiscuity and infidelity? Why do some star wives tolerate infidelity of their husbands or vice versa?
 Do you feel that (with the old Khan trinity ageing now) ..Bollywood might see a crisis in a decade's time? The new boys are ok in some movies but they dont have that mad star power which pulls audiences to watch a trashy movie.  
  
Also, this is a bit left-field..but what's the deal with the AIB boys? Does the industry welcome them/tolerate them? How much of it is due to Rohan Joshi's relationship with Mahesh Bhatt's daughter or something ?(not Alia) Bamboozled. It was Bhai Testing out us. [removed] Tell us some casting couch stories.

How much of Dawood bi's money is still financing the industry? I know he used to finance a lot in the 90's and early 2000's but out of touch since then about what's going on. He still has his close quarters etc?  Tell me something about a star which I don't expect.  
Like I expect Salman to be drunk 99.99% of the time. ..I expect SRK to kinda-sorta swing both ways ...tell.me something which makes me go..""whaaat? ...this guy ? Never made it to the gossip pages..he hid such a big secret!""    
  
Something like that  nawaz and irrfan's behaviour on sets? Who is Aamir sleeping with ? What is the deal with Imran Khan? Why is his uncle Aamir not helping him get a foothold back in the industry? Has he given up?  
Also, has Abhishek Bachchan given up too? He's done some decent movies in the past...Yuva/Guru etc. Tell us an interesting anecdote about someone in the industry that made you respect the person (no Salman stories please).

EDIT: ~~I think OP won't answer cuz he hasn't answered anything at all.~~ Sorry Why are star kids so dumb and try to defend nepotism by saying ""we had to work especially hard because we were star kids""?

Why does no one try TV? Like not something which the censor won't pass, but perhaps a situational comedy or a murder-mystery?

Pretty good AMA actually. And I know you are legit. I am related to the industry myself. I got a bunch of questions for you so don't mind. I actually do follow films and film news hence the many Qs:

1. How did Phantom survive after the debacle that was Bombay Velvet and Shandaar?

2. Any idea what's up with Saif now? His stardom has gone for a toss and he's only in the news for Taimur.

3. What's Anurag Kashyap's romantic/sex life like? Any news, rumours?

4. What's the industry thinking of Drishyam studios that has blown up with success of Newton?

5. How is Ranbir Kapoor with ADs, assistant, teammates? What's his demeanour like?

6. Any scandalous stories/gossip about the south imports: Tamannaah, Ileana D Cruz?

7. Is Kangana headed on a downward spiral? I have heard that major studios don't want to cast her anymore because duh..

8. Also I heard that producers/studios stopped working with PC because Gauri was miffed with the affair and so on. So she created parallel career in Hollywood. True?

9. On an average, how many outsider-screenwriters are trying to break into Bollywood every day? And do studios really read good scripts?

10. Given a choice, would you change your profession? Who is the most mean celeb and most genuine guy/gal celeb in your opinion?

[I don't know much names in bollywood other than few, so please don't be like be more specific] [deleted] Katrina Kaif's real origin story? How can I become a movie director or producer ?
How much they earn ?
And for a complete outsider how to enter the industry ? :) Most popular drug in Bollywood  What would it take to kill this entire industry? What can we do to make thought-provoking movies?  When can we get marvel/dc like series? Any plans of it?

The closest thing we've had is bahubali. How much did Salman made Arijit suffer? How's Arijit personally?  Who is gay in bollywood apart from Karan Johar How true is wife swapping and hotwifing prevalent in the industry? How about prostitution by low level actress/actor? Can you give more insight into the Vivek, Salman, and Aishwarya fiasco? How would you describe Koffee with Karan as a show? Do you think it shows a tad bit of reality of bollywood? Compare the technical ability of South film industry and Bollywood and professionalism of actors  1) Any casting couch stories about Amitabh Bachchan?

2) Any rumors about Abhishek & Aishwarya's married life? When are they going to call it off? How much thought goes into promoting social causes through films? Like, Bollywood filmmakers must know the impact their item songs are going to have on an impressionable audience. And we have seen some films try to change perceptions - movies like Pink comes to mind.

Do filmmakers think about the consequences of their messaging? And how much do you believe in these consequences?

 1) Why there is lack of creativity in stories and scripts?
2) Which Director, Producer, Actor, Actress have bad rapport for casting couch. Please name for all 4 categories.
3) How much bad working conditions for star doubles or stunt performers.
4) Is there any Who actually honestly indulged in charity but keep low. (Please don't mention Nana Patekar)
5) Which Actor is most famous for retakes? mind sharing some nsfw stories you might have heard floating around you ? What are some projects that were almost completed by big production houses and stars like AB,SRK etc but never released and never will cause of silly reasons such as religious and political opposition. Has SRK had any affair with anyone from the industry? What do actors crave for more than money? Like what is the next step they think like AAmir, SRK? 1. Have you seen actors/diretcors/assistants fighting  on sets which never came out?
2.How much do actors indulge in scripts/dialogue not the big ones but small ones like Varun,Sid,Sushanth category?
3. is Ranveer a maniac as he potrays?
4. How much do assitant directors get paid like Anurag's, Karan JOhar's like assistants of various director categories ? Any actor/actress that you think is smart/intellectual?  What's your avg lpm? Who do you respect the most in the industry? Why? Anything about Anurag Kashyap and the new lot of ""brave"" filmmakers? Are they different in the way they behave? or just trashy like Old Bolly...old wine in a new bottle types? Why do actresses agree to do scenes where the supposed hero forcefully kisses them What is one common myth the people have towards Bollywood?

How hard is it for someone to get into Bollywood solely based on talent?
( Like till now from the beginning of your work , how many(approx.) new talented people get into industry per year or total so far)      Does the underworld still have clout in Bollywood? Is vivek oberais career gone?  [deleted] How much politics do actors talk?
Do you know their political leaning?
Do actors like Aamir, SRK and Salman take sides? How hard is it for new writers to get into the industry who wants to make movies like the ones in hollywood with no songs but good storylines that could appeal to the indian public? asking for a friend. thanks [deleted] I want to know which actors are faithful to their SO and who aren't?  How to contact actors if you want to promote something ? What's your take on L'affair Hrithik and Kangana? Who's lying? Does Kangana have a poor reputation within the industry now? did u work with any south stars? Is Surrogacy a new trend for giving legality to love Child in Bollywood? What you like and dislike about Bollywood ? If given a chance what will you change ( hypothetical Q ) Mostly the fame feeds the ego and makes a egomaniac still who are the actors who are normal and the fame hasnt gone to their head........not professionally but when they meet anybody randomly Where is fardeen khan ?? Why doesn’t Farhaan Akhtar direct more movies? 
Was he just a one hit wonder.

",neoronin," I went on a 1300km bike trip last year and havent stopped bragging about it yet. Told all my collegues multiple times. Always mention it on any trip after that. Look down upon anyone who goes for biking trips less than 1300 kms. Don't ride KTM, you ll die. That's all.  Awesome Group of ladies. I’ve had the chance to ride with them on a breakfast ride before this trip. Met the crew and all. They inspire you to do more and be more than you think you can. Some of you might have done such trips 1000s of times. But for a group of ladies, it’s not a regular thing you come across.  ""Pioneering"" 

Literally thousands of people have done these roadtrips, they're all over the internet. 

Looking forward to the AMA.  Hello Team Bikerni !

Kudos on a ride well done !

However, that said, I would like to bring to your attention and to r/india's attention - one of your biggest failings as a group of women who are striving to upend the status quo in a traditionally male dominated activity.

That issue being blatant fakery, which Bikerni has never addressed officially despite numerous instances being known in the Indian riding fraternity. 
 
Here is one particularly noxious example...
  
As of 2018, a member from your Surat Chapter still continues to trumpet claims of having completed the saddle sore 1600 challenge in the year 2014. She happens to be President of your Surat Chapter BTW and also happens to claim to have ridden to Thailand and back along with the Surat chapter of Bikernis

As I am sure you would be aware, the SaddleSore 1600 (where a rider must cover 1600 km in a span of 24 hours), is organized by the Iron Butt Association USA, and happens to be one of the toughest and most dangerous endurance rides possible. 

However, in an effort to prove women are no less than men, the lady rider in question has resorted to blatant fakery ( going so far as making a cleverly designed fake certificate supposedly issued by the IBA ) and even using the laurels she received on the back of a fake achievement to promote herself even more ( based on multiple interviews she has given to the media )

This is wrong and unethical ! And there have been obvious consequences !

You can find here the link to the fake certificate bearing her name here on the ironbutt offical forum . And this has been highlighted by Mike Kneebone - The president of the IBA no less !https://forum.ironbutt.org/index.php?threads%2Findia-ride-certifications.10%2F

 A quick search of the member's name on the list of riders who have successfully completed the saddlesore challenge shows that she is not among them. You can search here for yourself https://www.ironbutt.org/certified.htm ( Ctrl+F the rider's name ) 

Now other members may dismiss this as trivial and something to be brushed aside. However, primarily thanks to her fakery, the IBA has stopped certifying any saddle sore attempts from India. 

The IBA has instituted a triple verfication for any attempts made from India, and as of 2015 - not a single person as managed to get a certifcation. Ride verifications that used to take -3 months are now at least 18 months minimum . ( as reported by a member on Iron butt india forums )  

This has happened thanks to the chicanery deployed by the president of your Ahmedabad/Surat Chapter !

While I do know quite a few of your members personally as truly pioneering riders - thanks to members such as the one highlighted above - overall your club comes across as nothing more than a slightly gimmicky attempt to hog the headlines. Such instances ( others include the Wrangler True Wanderer fiasco ) have left an overall sour taste pertaining to all things Bikerni  

While the mods may call your ride ""pioneering"";  I feel it was just another attempt to market yourselves as iconoclausts while the reality seems far from that. 


TLDR; Bikerni was responsible for ruining the saddlesore challenge in India. There are multiple instances of members having a major fallout with the club thanks to frequent chicanery. And overall the club has developed a reputation as headline hoggers and less serious women pioneers !

 I am going to ask Madhu Trehan what the hell has she done to her skin to make it glow so much. Yaar ek ek kar ke karaate. This is going to be crazy. These guys are sensible. Waiting for this AMA.

Yay. Gonna ask some stuff Are you getting enough financial support to sustain your business. Do you think crowd funding is working or if it is not then it will likely pick up in a country like India vastly different from Netherlands? Is there any other business model you have in mind?

second - can you get more informative shows like cleaners on a particular topic  Comment section is /r/cringe material [deleted] Looking forward to it. Arnab Goswami please looking forward to it. I'd be happy if Newslaundry becomes the Indian Version of John Oliver/Jon Stewart/Colbert on TV. Or maybe it already is, but not on that scale. I don't know if I will be awake but some one please ask Madhu when she is going to interview Arnab will abhinandan apologize? Disclaimer: I am not stereotype Internet Hindu.
I see that most of Indian media including yours have questioned, mocked, cartooned  Hindu teachers, gurus etc etc, which is good. But why is there a so much reluctance from media to engage other minority leaders? You guys are really good - please start making at least 3 video episode a week.

The details of the two AMA and the Reddit Meetup are below.  Both thread will be open for questions till Tuesday June 10th.

[**Ashok Chakradhar**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashok_Chakradhar) is a well known poet and professor of Hindi literature.  He specializes in satire and comedy. He is very well known for his recitals at Kavi sammelan/poetry gatherings. He has sent across a really cool verification video to invite questions: [**Link**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL7z17Eq-t8) (You can switch on the English captions in this video too)

We will collect the questions and pass them on to him. He will then send us the answers in a video format. **We will be adding English translations/captions to all his answers**, so please do not hesitate in participating in the AMA. Ashok Ji can speak in English, but we have encouraged him to use Hindi, a language he is a master of.

",kash_if," I am moving some information away from the main post to make it more reader friendly. I am preempting questions you guys might have:

>Why video/offline AMA?

We are trying different formats of engaging with our guests because at times coming online for an adequate time in one go and interacting with users is not possible for some people. Another reason is that at times, like in the case of Ashok ji, the way a guest speaks and the words s/he chooses adds a lot to the conversation, so a video/audio format might be an improvement over the current text version we use. In future we are also planning to organize a live video AMA. 

Your suggestions are more than welcome. Please tell us how we can improve this process or can add something to it. Also feel free to drop us a message to suggest names of people or give their contacts to us.

> So when can we expect the answers?

We are aiming to make it quick. Under 10 days is what we are aiming for. There is a certain amount of time involved at our end for Ashok ji's AMA to add English captions to the video so all of you can enjoy his answers.

 Devdutt Patnaik! Brilliant! Brilliant work, Mods! Your efforts will surely take r/India to new heights. great stuff mods! cheers How did you guy manage to get this AMA? Or do you wish to keep that a secret? Sorry about the lengthy title; I wanted to include all the information to bait you!  - Thanks for being honest. ;) [dilli ppls pls to chk out dilli meetup thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/27b88w/final_discussion_on_possible_venues_please_read/) any grils coming to meetup? :D *Asking here again because I didn't got an answer on the Devdutt thread.*
