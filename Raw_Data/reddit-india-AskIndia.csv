Need feedback for Insurance Policy that I took. (x-post AskIndia),1,1s57oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1s57oi/need_feedback_for_insurance_policy_that_i_took/,1,"**Re-posting here because of lack of activity in /r/AskIndia**

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

Go to the SP office of your town,file your grievance immediately on urgent basis,I think ASP’s will take cognizance of this.

Or

Visit SDM/Magistrate & ask them to take cognizance of this matter,once they’ve done that,you’ll be helped out.
Don’t worry,do either 1/2 ASAP Don’t visit local police stations,they’ve all been bought up by these goons,i will definitely trust the higher ups. Online complaints would be better mate if the police are not accepting your complaints

"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",13,bdfid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,27,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",FrustratedOCIHopeful," Honestly, she and her supervisor behaved *exactly* how most of our government officers behave with residents of India. Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely. As a Canadian, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits. This lady sounds full of shit. Why would an ambassador concern himself/herself with OCI affairs? 

Even if she isn’t lying, it’s worth emailing the consulate/embassy politely explaining the situation and cc-ing the ambassador if you can find their email. If there are multiple consular missions in the country, try emailing them as well. Tweet a summary with some details to Sushma Swaraj , she has helped ppl in similar situations Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through this. You'd think these people would adapt to the local work culture/ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals, which shouldn't be the case.

&#x200B;

Please tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs:  [https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) 

&#x200B;

make sure it's public and that her twitter is tagged in your post. She is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty. Do keep us posted about things you did for this issue. If it is just for a visit, apply for a regular visa. You can always visit India as a tourist. As regards your OCI card application, tweet or send a message to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with your experience. probably you are lying in fine details, or it is shitpost or karma whoring.

as an official, one can certainly say that - an ambassador is too busy to deal with  ""We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds)"" r/iamverysmart individuals.  
moreover, if any of the official encounters technical problems - it is impossible for them to say ""cannot be done because of bad mood"".

I'm British and would like to learn more about Indian history, but most of the most prominent scholarship on the subject in the UK has come from non-Indian Brits, and often comes with particular biases (particularly regarding British colonialism). I'd therefore appreciate it if anyone can point me towards good written histories of the country by Indian scholars.

What is 'Gotra'?,40,a2nsgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a2nsgt/what_is_gotra/,36,"Hey, there's a term quite popular right now in news debate, of 'Gotra' and I don't know what it means, so can anyone tell me about it?
(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)",ab370a1d," In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.

 Basically representing the ancestor.
e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.

Gotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it. Also you can use Gotra to tell from where a particular brahmin is from. That's how it was known Rahul Gandhi's gotra was from Kashmir.

Source: A Brahmin. There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra 'logic':

&#x200B;

*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*

[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1933302.The\_Seed\_and\_the\_Soil](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1933302.The_Seed_and_the_Soil)

>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman's body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women's nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.  
>  
>

>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed. This is the basis for what I call a 'monogenetic' theory of procreation.

"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",25,ai7392,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,17,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",fenocs," It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are ""spiritual""). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:

1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.

2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.

3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.

Btw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  ""Ramayan"" and ""Mahabharata"". I didn’t find what was the specific question though LOL, spiritual country my foot! Let me quote myself that I've written elsewhere, albeit bit edited. This was specific to issue of legalization of weed but, overall I think I got the point across.

Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,51,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,24,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends.",JaJH," You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. 

Quite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.

Having said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.

The real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. 

Eating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.

Regarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.

  


I also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad!",AskIndia,2019-04-18 22:43:12

European looking for opinions from Indians regarding how to make a difficult relationship work,28,968di3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/968di3/european_looking_for_opinions_from_indians/,67,"Namaste Redditors, (also posted to AskIndia but I am in need right now)

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

Thank you very much for reading and commenting. ",PsychoPass1," Hate to break this to you buddy, but you are the third wheel.

The sooner you get out, the better it is for you.

I would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible. Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. 

If there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! 😁 Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.

Now man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.

Don't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.

The responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. 

No matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  

So good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There’s a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  
You just run smack into it. 

She’s just like the majority.

(Most) Indian women simply don’t do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....

Unlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I’m sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her? Well I would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them. In many cases I have seen, Indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely. I would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust. That person can put in a good word to make things easier.
On a lighter note: Watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, it's a similar situation (to some extent). Understandably, she does not want to

Hurt her family's standings
Cause her family grief and pain
Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.... 


The ball is in her court. She needs to think independently and get this sorted. 

On the other hand,  I hope she loves you truly and not just because you're from a European country or for financial independence. You need to make this very clear. 

Please think twice before you proceed. 
Some Indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist. 

Her parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future. I'm also a  minor victim of this. 

 grandkids have fixed some of the relationships. your mileage may vary. Well I am late here. But all the best OP!

I hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you. 

In the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life ( I am sorry but that's how they work in India) and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them, there are possibilities. 

This would be a harsh test of her character and your patience, but I hope you guys come through. Please keep us updated  Move on and break up with her . Help info : where s her family located  ? What is her caste ? If she not willing to STAND UP TO HER PARENTS!!! LET IT GO

**EDIT:** *Should I flair it under Politics or AskIndia?*",concernedindianguy," Founders of Indian democracy did not create a model where you vote for a party or the PM candidate. Just because you like Modi/Raga/Kejriwal does not mean all candidates of the respective parties are good. What most people don't realize is by voting for a 'PM' candidate, they are actually destroying the spirit of democracy. 

For general elections, research local candidates all of parties. Find a candidate who is honest, hardworking and has a history of doing good work and raising issues that matter to you. If you blindly vote for a party because you support their PM candidate then you may get a local MP who is useless and will not contribute anything in development on your region.

NOTA. Look at your MP candidates and vote for the best one irrespective of their party... [deleted] Simply don't vote. The current version of NOTA is a joke on us. So not voting is the better option. Doesn't matter    

#EVM ==> Every Vote for Modi NOTA. I know it is useless, but I have to register my dissatisfaction with the quality of options given to us. Ask after 2 years.  I'm voting for AAP because I want to see what that insane man does. India has survived 60 years of Congress and nearly 3 years of BJP. I'm sure it'll survive a Kejriwal.  > If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state.

u lost me here.  [deleted] For me, it's gonna be anything but BJP. They have become too arrogant. Do you have any regional parties prevalent in your state? I'm from Hyderabad so I guess I could vote for TRS. They've been doing great work.  Vote for Priyanka Gandhi if she is next PM candidate  I'll probably try AAP now I suppose. Tried INC -> Didn't work. Tried BJP -> They've done some good IMO, but as of now, they are super distracted. So the only party that is even trying is AAP, so I suppose that gets my vote.

Honestly the demographic dividend problem (and resource) is a very big one that can make or break the country's future. And nothing but a fully-focused push can achieve anything. Even then, it might be far too little , too late, but I'm always a hopeful man, so I'll still believe. But time is running very very low for things to be in place (as is India, we are already way past deadlines), but lets see what happens. [deleted] BJP , there simply isn't an alternative ! If you need to ask others who you should vote for, I think you are an uninformed voter and should refrain from voting. A better idea would be to make yourself informed and decide for yourself.

I personally will probably vote for INC, unless a better alternative comes up, but you should make your decision yourself.",AskIndia,2017-04-05 20:24:57
"So I am writing a book, titled ironically ""Letters from your BFF"" in response to Nikita Singh's ""Letters to my ex"".",1,9b5g5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9b5g5p/so_i_am_writing_a_book_titled_ironically_letters/,4,"Hey everyone, I have flaired the post AskIndia, because I am seeking a conversation about absurdities of relationships and interpersonal friendships in today's world. 

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here:

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

We really need to talk about Flairs.,105,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",AskIndia,2017-05-15 21:21:16
"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",8,4qepvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,14,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

",rajasthaniConfused," >Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

It might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. 

>What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

These things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  

My personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. 

At the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage. I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. 
There will be problems and bitter feelings initially. 
Your first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? 
If you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. 

Stand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. 

Good luck! 

Edit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again?  > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

If arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

This is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.

It frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.

So if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their ""prestige"" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision. I can't answer this question. But you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about non-trolling answers.  If someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldn't be marrying the guy anyway.

Just my .02 rupee. Here is what i think , I think you are making a mistake. Leave her now.

Here is why?

If you wanted to be with that girl , absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter. No one and i mean no one has a right on your future life. You and your partner have to be the only ones to decide. So even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked, i posit that you are not really into her.

Drop it now, not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her.


 Honor Killing is a possibility... They'll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the ~~goats~~ gaus.. 

But seriously.. Fuck the orthodoxy.. If you want Indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows.. 

Screw your parents.. (Not literally).. Your sister will be fine.. Its not like she's gonna be married the next day of your own marriage.. 

Chill..Marry...Repent..  Evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one. If the answer is yes, other things don't matter. 

Time heals everything and when your parents/relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position.  Editing a few spelling mistakes. > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

Yes it will, Rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this. Both my sisters are Married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my Dad because of this (I am not pushing for Marriage, my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done.). But the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch, one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family. So that's that. If you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own, then don't worry.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Asshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years, after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing. If you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your GF then do go ahead and not let the Samaj bother you. If you are both outside India, then why don't you marry there. Nobody will really care in a few years.",AskIndia,2016-06-29 17:51:13

We are studying foreign policy this sem. This is the point my teacher makes again and again. Indians are so busy with basic issues that the other issues including foreign policy are ignored. It is one of the reasons that the Indian foreign policy is so non aggressive. It is hard to distract the public with basics when there is a war going on. Compare that to that of the US where foreign policy is one of the issues of presidential debate. I know it's unrelated but we did it in class today and I just wanted to share.

PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,41,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]

* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

"[Ask Reddit]Please advise, Balding and like a girl.",7,5hdfdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5hdfdd/ask_redditplease_advise_balding_and_like_a_girl/,42,"Hi, Randians. This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.
*Edit: Kindly ignore the [askreddit] in the title, wanted to write ask india:)

**Second Edit**: Sorry if i came across as childish or immature. Truth be told, i was drunk when i made this post and perhaps it impacted my replying to some of the posts. Some of you have suggested  
to talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week. My birthday is in Feb. and I pray to God that by that time i would be able to invite her to my b'day party. I will give an update, irrespective of the result. Thanks to all for your suggestions, it really means a lot :)",full_time_thug," Are you good looking and bald ? 

Are you  6 feet ?

All you have to do three things first.

For starters, please please don't let this be part of your sales pitch. 

>well settled for life in a secure job

This is more than enough. 

And don't worry about bald. Work with what you've got. Make that work for you. 
And as /u/immediate_cock mentioned, Lift, Lift and Lift more. i think you are not asking the right question to right people. i mean i doubt sehwag sir is a member here ?

i mean you have clearly demonstrated you are  person of means. quietly go for what sehwag sir did and regrow the silky smooth hairs on your balding patch. ( find a way to excuse yourselves from your GF )


BTW nobody knows what your girl thinks? maybe she is not really into your appearance only and may come to terms upon new knowledge about your balding head. 

so there are two ways given above. sehwag sir ki clinic ka address twitter DM me poochna, aajkal wo baato ke chakke marne me champion hai.  [deleted] > I am hopelessly in love with a girl  
    
No, you're not.  Balding like a girl? Is that in anyway different from balding like a guy? /s Tell her but don't take it to your head, you know, whatever she says. She's just another girl. Also the hair on your head has little to do with attractiveness. And you'll get over the ""feeling"".  

Cliched line, but since you are afraid of her rejection: Be a man.

Theres nothing of the sort in the pvt sector. Are you in a govt job?  Go Heisenberg style.  Dude you sound defeated , chicks dig confidence . Shave your head , hit the gym and watch the panties drop . Your mileage may wary, I started balding in early 20s , shaved my head and had an active dating life . Now mid 30s , happily married . Confidence is the key not some filmi love  Saar, pliss to give me her number so that I can talk to her since you don't seem to be very interested. Talk to her for fucks sake or forget her. Worst thing you can do is hold on to her and waste precious time You're probably screwed. It hurts worse than anything, I know ;) 

- Alt a) If you got the stomach for it: Clean cut. Don't have her in your life. You'll miss her and it will hurt for a while. But the pain numbs after about 6 months, soon you'll move on. 

- Alt b) Remember: we most regret chances we never took. You say she knows you like her. Well, then you making a move will not surprise her; she might even like it (small chance). Ask her out, go have a few drinks, see what happens.  Dude if u think balding is a problem, then life has got some nasty surprises in store for you. You say you are well settled. Have you ever thought about the millions in this country who do not even have a proper meal everyday and are forced to sleep in open in this cold weather? I suppose not.

"NEED HELP - People working in the IT Sector who have absconded a company in the past, can you please share your experience afterwards?",8,9afobq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9afobq/need_help_people_working_in_the_it_sector_who/,11,"I joined a MNC as a fresher with a 2 year bond of 1Lakh rs. Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

I know it's a long post but I need some suggestions.(I have been all over internet and discussed with other peers but couldn't decide on a final thing). Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

PS: I posted this in r/AskIndia already but couldn't get many answers. Hope this post gains more attention this time.",throw_for_bea," Even though your post is very long, the job you are thinking of switching to is not mentioned properly. Do you already have a company (to switch to) in mind or just going to join wherever you get? 

In my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview. At the end, it's all about what they think about you in the interview. If they think that your 6 months was productive, it doesn't matter whether you have a document or not. Though I did not abscond, I had a couple of rough exits from some companies, I told it to Wipro, they called the company which I worked for and truth was twisted.... and I lost the job offer from Wipro, the HR in Wipro told me, better dont show it, because no company wants an employee with a bad history Just be honest and upfront. Why hide?. 

Say I worked there, had excellent training and learnt a lot. Unfortunately, my project did not give me enough intellectual challenge and did not fit well in my career roadmap. Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.

Why complicate things?. If the company that you are targeting gets bothered by that approach, you need to ask yourself, do you really want to work for them. 

I don't think anyone will have time to really digg into what happened in those 6 months, rather they will spend time assessing if you are good enough for the job. And will you have clear free mind answering questions constructively instead of having something back of your mind like what if they find, what should I tell etc etc.",AskIndia,2018-08-26 21:53:51

Yeah and not just the subreddit.  For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .

My wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :

-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. 

-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)

-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.

-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.

or

-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.

On an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. 

Thats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.

If we could just tone down our condescending attitudes,maybe more people will start contributing on /r/india. Now what is seen is comments of same set of people on almost every post. that's exactly the problem with India,we have schemes and schemes of things,but no follow up to the end. /r/kannada Rarely Active?

Buying an apartment in Hyderabad,6,8dg2ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8dg2ih/buying_an_apartment_in_hyderabad/,4,"Hi everyone,
I am planning to buy an apartment in Hafeezpet. The total amount is 47 lakhs for ~1100 Sqft near main road. Is this normal price? I am not so keen on buying but my parents in India are adamant about it. Rent expected is around 15000 + 1500 maintenance. Planning to take a loan for 30 Lakhs and use cash 20 Lakhs.

Edit: I don't know why I am getting downvoted :( I just asked a question with the AskIndia flair!",mdocvar," When you said “Parents in India” I am assuming you are abroad. Actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs(chennai), but I didn’t . I don’t know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.

1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.
2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.
3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. 
4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.
5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.

Is it worth it?? Meh....

This is just my thought...... Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.


   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.

  You can also check out r/indiaInvestments ask the same thing there maybe those guys could be of more help.

[Mod Post] Introducing new flairs for better organization of content.,53,3ecyjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ecyjp/mod_post_introducing_new_flairs_for_better/,33,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

---

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

---

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon. 

---

**Edit:** We renamed the Regular flair to Scheduled to better reflect the purpose of the flair.",r_india_mod," [deleted] Yo. Team, I think we need to explain governance better, or force it to have a submission statement to raise the bar for the discussion. You have introduced new flairs. But how do you sort based on them? I see only 6 categories on the right... More Flair Categories: TIL, History/Philosophy/Literature, LongReads, Entertainment/Arts

Color Scheme for flairs: Similar to r/science or r/technology

Theme: Even r/Bharat a mature sub, has vibrant colors, our theme is dull, should have colors which looks interactive. > Governance - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts. However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions.

Thank you for this :) Add a bakchodi flair for posts like [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3eiy7w/i_got_this_kind_of_spam_first_they_make_me_bhaiya/) Just wanted to complement you for the Ask India flair. It's such a relief from the regular political bashing. A job well done dear mods! Can we have a flair for Defence ? To club news related to defence, intelligence and strategy ? Can we get an '**Entertainment**' flair for posting Bollywood related stuff? I suggest including a ""health"" flair.  we need a new flair to tag all the Twitter posts.
I want to filter them all out! Niyam kanoon toh thik hai, pehle is post ko sticky toh kar do. > Ask India - For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations

:D - Much needed! Can we get an '**International**' flair ? why misleading? why would i mark my own posts as misleading? Great!! Thanks for the speedy implementation! The flairs that you chose are great and will definitely help! However no call on the pol threads? >Regular - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers.

 I only have to say one thing .It seems from the eg /r/india mods put up like we Indians only care for sex and shit , there are tons of eg to put up. This doesn't look .. well good especially on a stickied post of most subscribed Indian sub.

"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",31,3huilc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3huilc/r_updated_wiki_rules_flairs/,98,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki. 

#Mobile Flairs
* AskIndia: [Ask], [AS], [Askindia],[Help]

> * **Link submissions** that refer non-personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a **self-post**

1. A self-post? Do you mean a comment?
2. Do you mean ""non-personal verified"" instead of ""non-personal and verified""?

> Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.

Isn't submission of unverified account anyway not allowed?

And so the only twitter accounts that are allowed for direct link submission are ""non-personal verified"" accounts like @PMOIndia, right? >Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.

In such a submission can the name of the twitter handle be mentioned in the title? Have seen a few such posts in the recent past. All of this is going to lead to  more controversies.  Ok, I almost never checkin here except when I do the odd RDD thread but I cannot believe this kind of policing is still happening!

What kind of a place has this turned into that it's making normal everyday indians who are more worried about the kujhli in their underpants to be this aggressive brand of assholes? Here we go again. More and more poorly thought out rules, imposed on the subreddit without any discussion. 

Indians are political and argumentative people. You mods cannot wish that away with your silly rules. Just let the sub be instead of trying to sanitize the discussions. 

This is a chai stall at a railway station, not a formal dinner in Victorian England.  Why is so much importance being given to political/religious threads? 

Why isn't the 'no low-effort' rule being applied to all the threads and posts? 

Man, either apply the rules uniformly or don't apply them at all and let us decide if something is high or low effort. I have seen the 'no low-effort' rule in other subs too but they apply it to everything. More subjective rules with loopholes as a pre-requisite and a necessary design criteria. 

Now, there is no way to differentiate between these two. 

1. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
2. Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.

So, basically, when our **subjective call** says that the user is ""*Flaming the forum*"", we can insta-ban the user. But, we can use yet another **subjective call** to claim that a different user was just indulging in Political humor. 

Just let this forum be. Why the fuck do we have religious threads This is how you make a Dead Sub. I've seen /r/india's rules worst so far. The twitter rules are fucking irritating.  >This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.

WTF. Why can't you guys just let the sub be as it is without adding new rules etc for even one month?

>Would be renamed to Policy. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government

I don't understand the need for a separate flair for this. Such discussions should be under Politics. [removed] Less objectivity, more subjectivity... I can already see numerous ways in which these rules can be twisted and interpreted to suit a person's personal biases.

>Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.

What criteria will be used to decide whether a comment is low-effort or not? Mods' subjective views?

>asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed.

Okay, so if supporters of a particular party bash another party based on a false report(as has happened so many times), and later on the truth gets posted, can we not ask where the bashers are now? Whats wrong with that? Nice. Also please try and do a full revision of the rules. Like all the rules at one place. Hallelujah!! Thanks for this! Are these rules going live along with post, or are you looking for building up opinion and then implememting it? 
 Agreed with the policy for political threads, but not religious threads. As rational people we should be allowed to ridicule religions. Not adherents, but the religion itself. 

If I wish to call Mohammad a paedophile, Yahweh a genocidal maniac or Indra a pussy-man, there shouldn't be a ban on it.  Could you sticky this, please? >accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions


WTF? Also, /r/IndianPeopleFacebook should be listed under related subs. 

/r/IndianFootball too. Oh, NSFW Indian subs too. Why the discrimination? What about genuine criticism of some aspect of a religion? For instance, me calling radhe maa human diarrhoea posing as a Hindu, rather than, say, calling Hinduism diarrhoea in religion form.

[R]Feedback thread the sequel. Results and announcements.,26,2o2rpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2o2rpl/rfeedback_thread_the_sequel_results_and/,256,"Dear Subscribers,

Thank you for all the comments and thoughts on the feedback thread. Based on that here are the most popular suggestions and our decisions

**Edit** - **check out the clarification about user's posting history, please**

* Bring back old “United We Stand Banner” - **done**

* New link flairs  to be introduced - 

   * Old article (older than 6 months)

   * Technology (phone reviews)

   * Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)

   * Finance

  * Twitter

  * Sports

  * AskIndia


* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones.

",i_am_not_sam," what about flair for **science** lets discuss science articles also , it will be very useful for learning new things  [deleted] >but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation

This is quite a violation, no?

I'm sure you will say that if you want to critique, bring it up within /r/india and not outside? But /r/subredditdrama can, while indulging in schadenfreude, still keep us on our toes instead of giving one the feeling that critique is being swept under the carpet. [deleted] I have hidden the score for 60 minutes for now, but I believe given the traffic in /r/India the comment scores should be hidden for 120 minutes. Thoughts? Can the OP be Highlighted more clearly? Its just a more saturated blue, which isn't easy to figure out. For example, most subs have a Blue Background box behind OP name when submitting comments. Can we at least get some Indian mods? Someone who respects Indian sensibilities? Someone who understands, recognises and agrees with the democratic opinion of the country? 

Actually, I know the answer. Take it up your own modmail. 
 > * Clarification on Flairs

This clarification has been a long time coming. You should have given this clarification *before* banning people from the sub for it. Anyways, better late than never.

> * Score hiding
> * New moderator
> * Repost removal

All good steps. I congratulate the mod team. Why has this thread been posted so late in the night?

Wouldn't the more logical thing be to post it during India hours when most active subscribers are awake? > Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will be holding elections in a few weeks.

So someone like hindusanghi123 will be the next mod now? > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.
 
Nope. It's become a lot more intolerant community which believes in violently criticizing groups of people or people in public but cannot take a personal insult when called to question on it. If you delight in shaming people you don't know from the comforts of your keyboard, it'd be hypocritic not to be ready to take insults in return.

> Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bullshit. So is the unverified twitter account rule.

> Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof , but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation.

Can (and is) abused. Use Meta flair for this.

> Score hiding

The crappiest parochial thought fart someone ever had.

> About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed

What's the problem with them? Bad titling?

> Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit

Absolutely no point to this. Leave it to the user's intelligence.

Adding a question, why is **pure theology** as /u/rahulthewall puts it is **banned** in this subreddit? Isn't this also a sub where history is discussed. A verse of the Rig Veda was banned while an article talking about Hindu mythology in medium.com was allowed. Clarify your stand. If you're supporting banning it in the future, that's stupid.

The twitter flair is a nice idea BTW. score hiding will be awesome. good job mods!

ps. would never want to become mod. too much hardwork. you guys are good keep it up Can you put multiple flairs on the same post? i.e. if I post an article which is more than 6 months old about a political subject - what should I flair it as?   

What if it's a Twitter comment which is political and more than 6 months old?   
 >Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bad

>but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama

Bad

>For instance /r/polandball[6] does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Bad.

Everything else sounds great.
 [deleted] Points are still visible on mobile or if you disable CSS, right?  Are you guys still taking the feedback? If yes then I suggest to NOT include AskIndia flair but instead redirect those to /r/AskIndia. Like /r/europe has on the top.

Also sometimes exact title rule doesn't really tell what is in the article. So for that something like *editorialized* flair should be there.

And now some queries - how much time should we wait for the mods to respond if the modmail is sent? Does *Repost removal policy* apply only to that article from one source or other sources too? Because different sources have difference in how the story is presented >About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.

You don't have to ban all links from these sites. Just the ones that have embedded YouTube/Vimeo videos. 

Also, could you guys have AutoMod notify us every time a comment that breaks the rule is deleted. I use c*unt a lot, and it seems to be a word that is monitored closely. Often I've noticed that my comments carrying the word get deleted even when used in a non-sexist or satirical context. I would like to know if/when any of my comments are deleted. I don't see what's wrong with it.  Thanks for the flairs!

Edit: I still see two flairs only. Not activated yet?

Edit 2: Ah I see.  > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.

> **Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal

What the fuck? May I know when are you going to ban words like ""kulcha"" and ""kulcha warriors"" ???  Thanks for the change.  > New link flairs to be introduced -

No kulcha flair? Nice Work , When it will be done ? > We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc

What about those cases in which no reply is received even after several reminders?

> please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. 

Again, you only pick and reply. The community should know if the mods are showing partisanship. 

> Is bringing up a user's posting history can be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

So basically I'm allowed to say one thing today and say something completely opposite tomorrow? > We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india[1] debate

What will be the criteria to select this shortlist? Thanks for the link flairs! That was required. 

Score hiding for an hour is good too. Please extend that to comment scores as well.

Could we have a ""Uplifting News"" flair? I have been requesting for this for a while! Plis to include me on mod nomination plij.

I think this sub can use a right of center mod. :P

 >  Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

Can a person abuse himself/herself in the flair? My flair e.g. All I have to say is, please make sure the next mod is not a liberal. ALL of the mods are liberal as of now. Approved  Can we have some information about RTI in the /r/india wiki?


Also why 

> cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india




 Still zero feedback for why the mods seem terrified or simply unwilling to take any action against certain posters of a 'secular'/Leftist political bias with a habit of targeting others and the r/india community as a whole.

Are these posters mods or admins? Is that why they are completely immune and get a blank check to do whatever they like? Please clarify.  BTW mods, I'd appreciate if you applied the 'won't show downvotes' rule for new threads as well, because me and other posters identified as 'bhakts' or 'Sanghis' have been facing very furious and concerted downvote herding from r/india's 'secular' posters and lurkers. 

Every new thread I've posted in the last couple of weeks has been quickly downvoted to keep its score near 0 and usually certain posters keep topping that up every few minutes to ensure it never gets more than a few total votes and stays far off the front page.

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)
",r_india_mod," Could you improve wiki? Many times a post/comment is removed citing some non-existent rule. And you don't allow to make meta post about it. Which I can understand because you don't want drama. You ask to send mod mail. We send but then you don't reply to mod mails too. 

* Remove politics from this sub. Like /r/unitedkingdom has /r/ukpolitics, /r/canada has /r/CanadaPolitics, /r/australia has /r/AustralianPolitics etc remove political post and direct people to post in /r/indianpolitics. It will improve this sub.

* Make things transparent. /r/Futurology has /r/FuturologyModerators/ and /r/FuturologyRemovals/ where removed things are recorded WITH reason. /r/technology has has their automod configuration public /r/technology/wiki/automoderator. Use a meta sub to which allows easier communication and discussions. Case in point /r/metacanada 

* Add this post and other mod announcement posts in the /r/india wiki.  [deleted] >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

If I have to explain my meme or image in a self-post it is kind of counter intuitive, no? 

I mean, a picture is supposed to be worth a thousand words. My two bits:

* Remove the political post/politics altogether from this sub.

 our life is teeming with enough politics already be it newspaper or news channel with blaring mindless debates airing all day. And since many redditors have complained about the same in many self posts it seems like the right time to do so.
You can direct those who wants to discuss that to something like /r/indiapolitics if it exists or make one for them like many other countries sub did , if still you see people have this great uncontrolled urge to discuss which politician wrote what on twitter and those other shit you can always give them a warning first and if they don't comply then ban them from this sub(not shadowban,let them know why they are banned).

*  I'd suggest some flairs like **arts, sports and religion**. More flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably won't downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people. +1 for no political twitter spam > Remove low-effort political self-posts

Please elaborate on this?

Also, you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your process. >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

I don't think this serves any purpose at all. The reason these memes and tweet links exist is not for OPs to score cool karma points, but to reinforce his/her own political views. So self post or not, these low effort posts would continue to clutter the feed. 

>Remove low-effort political self-posts.

You will need to elaborate on this or else you are going to get accused of muzzling opinions.  Since there is an announcement, I want to bring up couple of points which affects the quality of discussion here.  These are tangentially related.             
Does this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? Is it a place for discussion only or reddit India supported activism?  For example Net neutrality debate. I think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl. It encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices.          
I think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like NN which lead to brigading in real life.  Shouldn't have happened.            
Second, do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? And is there a criteria. I  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted. I  see that as an encouragement. 
 Ooh.. common account as a mod.. 

*interesting*

Governance flair sounds good. Hopefully we'll have more discussions on that.
 How about a flair to seperate the faking news/unreal times articles from the real news. > Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Yes and yes. >but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this.

Any other conditions? Wheeee flairs!!   
TIL, LPT/jugaad, ELI 5, ITAP, TOMT, throwback for old awesome posts that newcomers can enjoy like out of loop.     

But can we also have something against down voting self posts into oblivion?     
 [removed] You people tried to moderate political thread last time as well it didn't work. Politics is the major subject on this sub and unless you double the moderators keeping political posts strictly r enforced will be hard.  [removed] Having to explain memes kind of spoil the fun. And that also kind of deters the content makes (Who am I kidding, no randian makes original content). Even then, atleast its possible in the future. Aand thats how you make a dead sub...btw instead of these useless flairs why not make a ""Delhi"" flair to filter it out all the useless AAP posts. I have a moderation related questions.   

When Moderators delete a post, I have seen 3 kinds of things happening.

1. A comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   
2. A [deleted] message appear on the self post    
3. Sometimes neither of the 2 happen, but the post still disappears.    

So what's the difference? Why not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation?   
 Add a flair for geopolitics.  AskIndia is good but I don't think Governance flair would be used often. Rather, have a Weekly flair for regular posts. Another suggestion, have a BJP/AAP/Congress flair along with Political. A lot of people want to read political news not related to these 3 parties.  Rules rules and more rules....At this rate One day you will have to delete all political posts and move it r/IndianPolitics  > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. 

no direct submission to posts made by verified twitter handles makes no sense. make this rule about unverified twitter handles.

verified twitter handles serve as news source, and you have policy of not editing the news headlines, but you want users to editorialize  the 140 character twitter posts. That defeats the purpose of twitter, as a platform.

 Please could you add a crime flair. We get quite a few of those posts, and one for the counselling needed type relationship posts.

How do you define low-effort political self posts? Also what about low-effort political comments in political posts? Can you guys have the automod say which words are censored from the sub so that when my comments get deleted I can remove the offensive words? Thx Mods can you bring back the weekly movies thread

They were being done earlier but then were disbanded dues to lack of popularity after some time

Now with the whole make /r/india better thing going on

I think it would be good time to bring them back, and see how they work now

Plus it would also increase semi-Original Content and NP posts

Maybe stickie those threads early on Whenever we have one of these posts, it is followed by another list of new rules. Can we just let things be for a while?  Please bring up new ways to help new redditers  [deleted] IMHO, you guys need to cut down on your stupid rules, instead of making shitty new ones. 

You guys remind me of the following story:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller,_his_son_and_the_donkey I can pitch in as mod and help out if you guys are okay with that. 

Edit: just saw the comment by the mods regarding signing up. Will modmail.  - Regarding ""no direct submission to images"" for [P] posts, could you please clarify the reasoning behind this idea? Doing away with memes and ""caption this"" makes sense, but why all images? For example, would an image of a politician slapping someone not be relevant content which would not require any further explanation? Additionally, if you do decide to go ahead with it, why just images and not audio/video?

- Could you clarify what a ""low-effort"" political self-post would be? Would all such content need to be backed up by data or are opinion pieces also allowed? If data is to be made mandatory, how would you plan to make sure that the content isn't an op piece with some data just for the sake of sticking to the rules? [deleted] ""Governance"" flair is an interesting idea. Not sure how much traction it will get but it's worth a shot. There is a very urgent need to separate political bullshit and rhetoric from actual impactful decisions that political parties are taking.  I am very against these ideas of writing essay for self posts. I have already expressed my opinion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3d8epc/is_noise_drowning_out_the_signal_in_rindia/ct2to3p):

> and low-effort content is always upvoted to the top

subjective. people upvote what they like

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.
> 
> No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.

it's censorship. mods shouldn't decide what is 'low-effort' and what is not. the members of community should.

and not everyone wants to read a essay about why submitted an image of some tweet. 

>  /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards.

People like it. Let them decide what they want by uproots/downvotes.

 We need more flairs. Arts, Movies, Books, TV, etc etc. 

We need weekly threads for different topics. Can we automate this please?  Be more strict with with titles which are unverified and misleading. I see them not tagged Wrt flairs.

Try and choose a flair which is a unique set with minimal Overlap and a topic obvious from the name.

So for example governance could be policy. Entertainment I think would be too broad.

Sports is a good choice. I think DIY maybe of value. Ask is another option.  Please take care of posts which are low effort under political flair. Don't let them shitpost. For example like today 

Really low effort & shit post

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlxn8/proof_that_rss_is_literally_hitler/

One line statements from Twitter which creates cicrle-jerk

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlo0y/tell_narendramodi_to_remove_his_paramilitary_from/

Rather ask such people to make self posts or wait till any media house writes a full article on this. What is the point in creating multiple threads due to just one comment from any politician?

As we are growing, we are lacking space on the front page, news & politics keep on clogging up that space.

Please don't resent anything & be harsh on these assholes. You have my vote on this.

Please bring more flairs other than AskIndia/HelpIndia like Sports & Entertainment. Please have more weekly threads like those tech threads & also sticky those threads so more people comment. Thanks for taking the initiative, the new flairs sound like a good idea, implementing them, a far bigger proposition, but doable!!    
>Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced         

This needs to be done. I know it is a big task for the mods, but its the need of the hour! You can find people who are actually driven to do this, and if implemented,along with removal of low effort self posts, will be a welcome respite, and greatly improve the quality of political discourse in the sub.    

Again thanks for trying to bring about a change and I wish you guys all the luck to go through with it. you'll need it :) Could we limit the posts with personal questions and rants? They're almost always unverified, troll bait and conform to the subs circlejerks.

I'd love to see more moderation of those posts than deleting ""Chaddis vs AAPtards"" kind of comments. The latter get downvoted pretty often, anyway. Could you post some guidelines about downvoting that people will see more prominently when they are about to downvote?

Right now whenever someone sees something they don't agree with, it is downvoted to oblivion and it fosters a kind of circlejerk where you only see the majority opinion and anything that disagrees just disappears.

Other options might include keeping the threads in contest mode for a longer time. I used to avoid /r/India like the plague, but now I'm starting to see a lot of intriguing discussions. I still disagree with some people, but we are able to discuss in a logical and informed manner, as opposed to the childish, irrational, and chauvinist way people were a while back.

Re-subscribed. 1. Strictly objective rules. Remove all subjective interpretation from rules. This continues the situation of ""we have fallen short"" remark. When there is no objectivity, two people can have a different opinion about the same comment, and then a rule ceases to be a rule and becomes an opinion. 
2. Self posts for images. Well, there is already a work-around and loophole in current rules where users can post a collage of more than one twitter screenshot and not use exact title rule. Self post provides an easier editorializing of the title. Exactly how will this help reducing shitpost is unclear to me. 
3. New common account that is purely for communication. Does this mean you are now willing to discuss controversial mod decisions in public? This will help the community to understand the thought that went behind deleting some comment or thread and what was the subjective reasoning used? Unless subjective decisions are discussed and debated, these rules are just anchors of imposing your opinion on mod activities. Any comment can be constructed to violate any random rule because ""I felt so"" without any accountability to the community! Modmail is just a safety net because you are afraid that you may have been wrong and 15 people collectively pouncing on one person is better that 300+ people pouncing on the mods for a wrong decision.  Media,Random,Other.


I guess these will be cool flairs. [deleted] Good points...personally, am in complete agreement  *AskIndia*   *Governance*  what do this flairs even mean? 

And how am I suppose to make a self post on a meme in NP category? Defeats the purpose of Memes doesn't it? Thought this place would be more open and free. Definitely need a Political sub and also rules 'only where needed'.  [deleted] >Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Who is going to decide this ?
As it is, there is already too much censorship in a so called platform for free speech. Request:Can politics/religion related posts (I put those two because they are closely linked) be moved to /r/IndiaPolitics or /r/IndianPolitics or whatever that sub is? Would be nice to have more music related posts. Especially folk music from different parts of the country. Please ban twitter and facebook from unverified accounts altogether. Even the ""screenshot+blur"" thing is ridiculous. Self posts with an actual argument that quotes statements from known but unverified officials (i.e. legit public figures who don't have the mark of verification) should be allowed. >Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

And yet you have trolls calling the PM a faggot. How about a [Health] or [Medicine] flair as well? Indians can do with some evidence based medicine. > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.   

I agree with twitter restriction and most of twitter posts are again self-posts without any explanation behind them^Swamy. But, memes keeps the sub interesting. Some of the memes are shit, but I have seen some amusing ones that are randian's creativity.   


> Remove low-effort political self-posts.

[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,163,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,82,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",ringtring," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India. It's just 24 minutes(skip the first 2 minutes of intro) and really goes into depth, yet in an accessible way. 

https://youtu.be/qAuBZQNpOV4?t=2m53s Since East Asia was mentioned... bit off-topic but can someone ELI5 how Japan became such a developed country after US completely fucked them over with the Tokyo firebombing and atomic bombings? What the fuck is happening today, back-to-back quality posts.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

This video does an amazing job of explaining the problem with fpps. 

There are several alternatives to it, some are linked in that video itself.

Fpps is considered to be one of the worst system of elections and you can trace many of our problems to it. 

Edit: some of the alternatives are alternate vote and single transferable vote.  Fpps is the system in which the candidate with the most number of votes wins, regardless of the number of votes. 
For eg, there are 9 candidates in an election. One gets 12% and each of the others get 11%. The one with 12%will win the election since he has the highest number of votes despite his share being very low. 

This was the system followed in Britain at the time of Indian independence. That and the simplicity of the system led the makers of the Constitution to adopt it.

[NP] Cost of shipping to UK,2,2zstbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2zstbi/np_cost_of_shipping_to_uk/,5,"Hello! I first posted this in /r/AskIndia but was advised to repost in /r/India. I am an expat and have been living in India for the last eight months. We are going back to the UK and need to ship some stuff home - the speed is not an issue but we need a good price.

We have about 20-30kg of stuff to ship to the UK. India post has quoted us 4k rupees for 10kg, which seems very very expensive.

We have checked the internet but everything seems equally expensive. Does anyone know if there is a cheap reliable way to ship things to the UK by surface mail? (From Delhi or Udaipur)
",duncanstibs," Did you check with DHL or FedEx? 
 


Edit :

But my guess is that India post might turn out cheaper  It is expensive, someone sent a book from UK and the shipping costed about 1000 or maybe more. It was those big self help hobby type books. But yeah, 20 kgs is going to cost you a lot. :( if it's only 20-30 Kg why can't you take it along with you? pay extra for the baggage. It would be wise not to use India Post - particularly if your items are something you care dearly about. ",AskIndia,2015-03-21 20:26:10

Would Grad Schools in the US(I have no clue about how it works in Germany,Would Love if someone could shed some light on it too!) accept Msc degree holders from India?
PS:X-Post from r/AskIndia",VIKing10," They do accept , provided you have an excellent academic record along with other things to show , like research papers , RA etc. The acceptance rates are very low though.

If you consider swiss uni. like ETHZ , they also ask for course material you referred so that you meet the academic standards/background they expect. I assume it's something similar in Germany. US universities generally accept any 4 year course if you want to apply for MS/MS+Phd. They look at your academic record and GRE scores.

Getting into top-end universities is extremely hard though and there is a lot of competition from all over the world. If you want full scholarship (this is usually given to MS+PhD students) the competition is just insane for places like MIT/Stanford.

I'm not 100% sure about Germany but the UK accepts Indian 3 year undergraduate programs (except medicine, you need to sit for PLAB). I'd imagine germany is similar to UK. I just saw this on my FB feed about PhD in Germany. Check if you find anything useful. DAAD, a student exchange programme between India and Germany, hosts many webinars and expos.

"r/india, what's your Entitled/Idiotic Indian Abroad story?",335,cjv92h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cjv92h/rindia_whats_your_entitledidiotic_indian_abroad/,392,"Most of us must have watched that viral video of the Indian family stealing stuff from a hotel in Bali. Not saying that this behaviour is exclusive to us, but I'm sure a lot of us have witnessed this first hand. What's the worst incident you recall first hand of Indian folks behaving badly abroad?

For me:

1. Our flight was awaiting departure at the Malaysia airport. Suddenly, the weather turned bad and it started raining very heavily on the runway. The pilot announced that there would be a delay of few minutes due to weather conditions. Hardly 2 mins later, this Indian lady - a honeymooner from her looks, gets up and starts yelling at the crew. ""Explain to me what is the issue"", ""what is the estimated time for fixing the issue"", ""Oh so our time has no value after paying so much money?""... BC pakka some IT mid level manager who kept yelling to ""fix issue asap"" at the poor crew. Her husband was of course supportive and joined her in the shouting match. Eventually, it took some co-passengers to calm them down.
2. Possibly the worst people to board a plane could be found on the Bangkok route. Groups and groups of crass middle aged men making lewd comments about the air hostess, or hell, even singing antakshari at night because they thought it'd be funny. Even more tharkis asking their co-passengers where to get the best ""maal"".
3. Seen many people throwing trash on the streets (habit from India), being obnoxious to other tourists (mocking them for their physical appearance or ethnicity) and sharing like 1 beer amongst 5 people. While in Pattaya, a HUGE number of establishments (strip clubs, bars and lounges) turn away Indians for these reasons. If they see brown guys approaching, they just tell them ""Sorry, members only"".
4. Reasonably well behaved in hard-assed Singapore. I wonder why...
5. On a flight to Dubai, after the flight took off, a Muslim guy got up and started looking for something in the overhead compartment. So, this moron sitting next to me calls the air hostess and asks her to check what he is doing. ""Bomb nikla toh?"" he said that so loudly that even the Muslim man heard it. Turns out, the Muslim man was just taking out his lunch box. ""Burger hai bhaijaan, bomb nahin"", he said while getting back to his seat.",rushils," Any flight going to Thailand is usually trash. Always filled with a group of obnoxious uncles who are so giddy about getting laid that they literally can't stop chirping throughout the flight.

Thailand in general tends to attract some absolute shit tier tourists, regardless of nationality. Oh man. So there was a huge line in Bangkok for boarding pass and everybody was standing still in line while some impatient people of my own country literally unhinged the rope from the pole and got in between.
Everybody fucking followed and got in the middle. The airline crew had to come and maintain decorum. The white guys just stood surprised. I was at the Chicago airport and some elderly women sitting across me at the gate, loudly, in my native language (Telugu), started gossiping to each other about what I wearing (sneakers, jeans, a t-shirt and a hoodie). After like a minute or two I told them in Telugu I can understand everything they're saying and to mind their own business and they had the audacity to tell me I don't know how to speak to elders. Changing a baby's diapers on an empty seat WHILE PEOPLE AROUND ARE HAVING THEIR MEALS. 

I've never seen a flight attendant so upset; he had to almost drag the mother to the washroom (where they have baby-tending facilities) >even singing antakshari at night because they thought it'd be funny.

What the actual fuck. Cutting into queueus, gets on my nerves every time ! > ""Bomb nikla toh?""

Security check-ins are just a casual formality for him. Not Abroad but an asshole Indian family from abroad spotted at Delhi airport. I landed from Leh and was super hungry and late because my previous flight landed late. This family argues on the counter while taking boarding pass asking for a free upgrade. Upon asking why sir, Have you bought an upgrade ? Their reply was ""actually we're from US"". Whenever I go to india from Tokyo to Delhi via Thailand, the difference between the two legs of the journey is huge... Had gone to Switzerland and there were a lot of Indians. On Jungfraujoch, there was this middle aged guy who shouted in the loudest voice I’ve heard: “IS THIS VEG!?!?” Everyone looked at him but he didn’t give a shit. Since he was evidently not going to apologize, I went and did the good deed. Someone from the same group was trying to score a mini bottle of Red Label for free even though you had to pay for it. Their argument was that “we have bought so much food, we should get one for free.” Eventually the cashier got hella pissed and refused to serve them. 

When I read the the rules that the Swiss hotel had put up, I wasn’t surprised. That’s not racism people, a lot of travelers are just rude and entitled. This didn't happen to me, but when my SO was flying to Dubai, there was a middle-aged Indian man who was sitting next to her (with one seat gap between them). He straight up grabbed food from my SO's meal saying don't mind no? He also proceeded to fight for more free alcohol after having like some four pegs before.

I was glad there was a seat between him and my SO and she got out safely but man, you tend to meet some really creepy people on flights.

I have also seen Indian families just walk to plug points in airports and proceed to remove other peoples charging paraphernalia just like that, without asking them and then put their own chargers there. After that, they proceed to beg saying please please and then hog that port until the end of time. Why is it that as indians we hate to see other indians when we visit some place touristy? Is it just me ? When I go some place and see indians there I get upset and think oh no these fuckers are here too !! On my flight back from Heathrow to dubai(final destination India), there was an Indian lady with her son, sitting on my window seat which I had booked as soon as check ins opened. She said with such entitlement to me that you can sit on the aisle seat. Didn't find it decent to say anything or maybe I didn't have the right words at the moment, I settled into the aisle seat. After sulking within for 10 minutes, I asked her to move back to her seat.

I might have given the seat had she asked politely but the attitude!!! The antakshari point made me cringe inside out Literally, everytime I get on a flight. To or from the us to india, there are obnoxious Indians, who either block the boarding gates even for disabled passengers. While getting off the plane, they dont care if their luggage is banging others and will run over others in front of them. The worst part is when the steward / stewardess bring drinks. They try to hog drinks like its holi. 1. The 'First One Out' game that we guys play as soon as the flight has landed. We all are used to seeing this but it's fun to see the faces of foreigners new to this experience.

2. Drinking beyond limits just because it's free - another thing that we frequently see on International flights. 

3. Not seen most Indians doing this but have still seen a considerable amount breaking queue everywhere possible, be it coffeshops, grocery stores, airport lines, toilets. Was fun to see our fellow countrymen breaking queues for Tube Tickets and the Englishmen just shaking their heads or muttering to themselves since they are too polite for their own good. 

4. Have seen a full blown fight between an Indian group of 7 to 8 and a Pakistani group of nearly the same size in a UK pub. It happened because a guy from one of these groups was acting fresh with a lady from the other; don't know if these individuals were Non Residents though, police had to be involved. Ohhhhhh God there are so many .

 bunch of gujju aunties being reprimanded by an security officer at airport toilet . Apparently they had deviced an unique strategy , where woman who is using the washroom would lock the door with one leg so the next one can go inside after her without paying for each individual use . Like this 8 or more women used to go at same time . They had absolutely no shame on their face , nor do their husband . On the contrary , they seemed proud of the unique idea . I even heard one of them saying proudly ""madam , expert Che""

Why do such people  even travel Europe , Australia etc for vacation . Got on a flight from Abu Dhabi to Ahmedabad in which I was on the window seat next to an elderly gentlemen on my right. He had come before me and once I sat down he started to complain about how unethical and disgraceful it was that the flight had put him next to a girl, lol. He moaned and moaned until a younger gentlemen sat in front between two men asked him to swap seats. So this is in Sydney. Everyone takes the train to get back to the suburbs in the evening. And it's also well known that the train network is complicated, and a signal issue, or a medical emergency at one station can create delays and a backlog for hours. (Trains run every 2-3 min during peak hours). 

During one such day a signal issue at a station meant that every train going in that direction was delayed for an average of 15 min. Every signal was turning green slower than it would. The train I was in was later on and was also majorly affected. We were delayed by 30 min, and the train was stopping every now and then waiting for the signals. 

The train driver kept announcing frequently that he's waiting for the signal and that's why we aren't moving. Also said Sorry for the inconvenience even though it's not his fault. When the train stood for long at a platform he'd open up the doors and say passengers are welcome to stretch out on the platform, and he'd inform when he's ready to leave.

During one such stoppages and Indian uncle got pissed. We were in the first compartment. He got down at the platform and started shouting at the driver for the delay. He said things like ""You may drive a train, I have more important things to do"", and ""its because of people like you, trains are always late"". The driver was patient and just repeated that he cannot move until he gets his signal. 

Uncle was not happy. Kept screaming, and said ""do you think I'm a fool"". An Australian gentleman told him he was a fool and asked him to shut up and defended the driver. 

&#x200B;

And then Uncle says ""My wife will scold me for coming late"". The entire compartment laughed out loud and Uncle lost his voice after that. Saale sab dusron ko dosh de rahe hain, apne girebaan mein koi nahin jhaank raha hai!

T: Everyone is blaming others, no one is introspecting to identify the mistakes they made themselves.

I will tell a story where I was the idiot/entitled one. First time I went to US, I went to my hotel to check-in. The woman at the reception was talking to another customer. There was a slight pause in their conversation and instinctively I thought this is my opening and barged in. She immediately stopped me with, ""Sorry sir, I am talking to this gentleman here"". That was the first time I realized that you are supposed to wait for your turn patiently. On the other hand, when I came back to India, it became evident that this won't always work in India because if you politely and patiently wait for your turn in India, your turn will never come. My worst experience was in Finland last year. I was there on an exchange program with my school and my friends and I were in a club. I was getting a drink at the bar and this Indian dude came up to me and started asking me shit like, ""Yaar firangi ladki ke saath baat karunga to chodegi kya?"". I told him not be a dick. Apparently he was there for a business thing and he worked for Nokia. He started asking me to set him up with some of my female friends (none of them are Indian so he thought this was his chance). I squarely told him to fuck off and not to embarrass himself. Then I stepped out for a bit to take a call while my friends were inside. While I was outside a female friend of mine came outside to tell me that apparently some Indian dude was bugging them and he claimed to be my friend. I ran back in to tell him to fuck off but by then the bouncers had already gotten to him. They asked me if I knew him and I told them everything that happened. They asked me to leave anyway but my friends kinda stood up for me. It was embarrassing as fuck so I left anyway... 

The fucked up part was that, that guy wasn't even drunk. He was just a fucking choot. Was on an Air India flight heading to europe. There was a family with a kid whose diaper was soiled and  was stinking badly (obviously). The kid was still sitting on the seat! But that’s not all. When the air hostess intervened, the father of the child casually said, “No, no it’s fine. We will land in 2 hours anyway.” The most common thing among desis in Western countries is buying stuff with the express intent of returning AFTER using. Many have turned it into an art form - what to say, how to appear belligerent, how to abuse the system shamelessly, etc. Thankfully, the ABCDs (next generation) are thoroughly embarrassed and want nothing to do with their parents' shenanigans. A few recent incidents:

1) I'd been to Yellowstone with family and there are these pools there which have a high concentration of bacteria and they shouldn't be disturbed for ecological reasons. There are SEVERAL signs saying ""Bacterial pool/mats, please do not touch"", but despite this I noticed some full grown adults that were a part of a huge Indian group touch and splash the water around. If not for the sake of the environment, at least have the common sense to not touch water that is literally filled with bacteria!! The most embarrassing scene was when this young Chinese child who was also a part of the tourist group shyly point to the sign and say ""no no"" that these adults noticed and didn't pay heed to. I'd finally had enough and approached these people and asked them to move away from the water because they weren't allowed to touch it after which they reluctantly moved. Looking at this scene this old white guy who was walking by mumbles ""Fucking tourists"". 

2) There's a park near my place where kids play and adults walk around in the evening. At the same time this huge group of aunties, I'm guessing housewives convene near the play area which is usually so silent and peaceful and start a racket loudly in Hindi/Punjabi, while their kids play. Laughing and gossiping about random things.. it's such a nuisance. No one's asking them not to talk, but maybe call your friends home and host the racket. I will never understand why it's so difficult for people to just fit in and behave like people around them.. The ""Why fit in when I was born to stand out"" quote has been taken too literally some some of them.

I haven't seen too many people misbehave here though.. what annoys me more is how they behave like law abiding decent citizens here and the second they return to India, throw garbage around, and behave badly. You come here and see how clean and beautiful everything is and after living here for a while, they sure as hell know how to maintain such a place, then why do they behave badly when they get back? Because ""Eh it's already dirty, nobody follows the rules anyways, everyone honks anyway so why shouldn't I do the the same"". A guy yelling at the Air hostess for not helping with his bags. His reason: he has heart issues and its her duty. He was so proud bitching about her the whole way that I felt so bad being an Indian. He even complained about her to all her co-workers. Never been abroad, so no stories to add here but that last one hurt. Well I live in Singapore but I swear Indian tourists(mostly) when alighting from the plane in either countries(or even other countries as a matter of fact) are in such a hurry like the doors are not open have some patience please

Also not to mention the loud talking. If u understand an Indian language u can easily know what they are talking about 1. Airports! Always! Worst one was at Charles De Gaulle, a flight to India, and the passengers had crowded the boarding gate, and were not willing to go sit down and line up according to groups. The gate staff were initially nice, then they got a bit firm, but the passengers were not relenting. The crew had to finally bring out the pilot or co-pilot, who was a Sikh Indian, who had to yell at them in Hindi to sit, and behave orderly, or they would hold up boarding.
2. Walking around some markets in Munich with my husband, we were minding our own business. This desi looking uncle, with his wife and kids is at the same stall. Suddenly starts chatting with us, which is fine. We exchanged pleasantries, then this peacock starts to tell us how he is an American citizen, has a big house in New Jersey (lol, who says that to a stranger), kids are US citizens, and some other supposedly-braggy bullshit. He only stopped when I told him we lived in Orange County, California. Cause apparently that one-upped him. This is why I dont like to talk to stranger desis. Its always a ""whose-dick-is-bigger"" contest.
3. I pre-select my seats on a flight, for personal reasons. Once on an SG-Mumbai flight, there is me in the aisle, a desi guy in the middle, and Indian aunty in the window. As I am arranging my luggage overhead, she makes an arrangement with the guy in the middle seat. Guy in window, me in middle and her in aisle. Why? Cause ""baaju mein gents aa gaye na"" She wont sit next to gents, but its ok for me to. (TBH i dont care, but hypocrisy much?). Then she said bathroom jaana padega. I said I'm ok to get up for you to go. She only relented when I told her I paid $20 to ensure an aisle seat, and she could have it if she gave me $30. 
4. If you sit in the back of the plane on a flight to India, you will notice, the red label will never reach you. The uncles will always finish it before service is over. :-P

Having said that, this ridiculous, entitled behaviour is almost always uncles and aunties. I've met some really nice people in their 20s and 30s who always talk about general things, offer travel advice and share their experiences. I always have problem with north indian groups traveling abroad. They are very loud in flight and they look down on Telugu/Tamil people. And also their funny English accent on a flight to Europe is more cringy. A (maybe) newly married couple complained about their pizza having only tomato sauce and cheese and ""none of the other toppings we get at Dominoes or Pizza Hut"". At a pizzeria. IN MOTHERFUCKING ROME, ITALY. [deleted] 1. On a flight to Singapore an oldie Aunty (50-55 years) and a middle aged man (Late 30s-early 40s) start chatting loudly in what sounded like Marathi to my northern ears. This was after the meals had been served and lights turned off on a 12 hour flight. A few old Australian passengers who were trying to sleep asked them as politely as one can to speak a little less loudly. The old lady went nuts with the usual,”We have also bought a ticket, we will talk as we like...blah blah”. The other passengers just pay back on their seats as if resigning to their fate. I don’t know why they didn’t call the flight attendants. 

2. There is loud and then there is Punjabi loud; and I know this because I’m one. A Punjabi Aunty in the seat ahead of mine talking loudly over the phone, telling the person to take in her ‘kachera’ (Punjabi for kuccha/underwear) on the washing line because it seemed like it was going to rain. This was just before takeoff and she didn’t shut up until the stewardess asked her to. 

3. On a Cathay Pacific flight full of Indians travelling from HongKong to Delhi a Sikh uncle (mid/late 30s) probably from Delhi asked the stewardess to carry his duty free wine in her luggage so he didn’t have to pay any duty on the load of alcohol he was carrying. The rest of the passengers were such a pain as well, as they kept walking around and not sitting down even after the pilot’s announcement that they were about to land. One guy kept trying to access his carry luggage when the seatbelt sign was on, for some reason until the male steward gave him a firm talk. The stewardesses were holding their heads in their hands. 

Many such stories but if you are one of the more enlightened ones, please go out of your way to change this image of uncouth, loud and rude Indian traveller. It might not be your making but it affects you as much as it will affect the people who are responsible for it. My worst flight ever, my personal flight from hell. AI Paris to Mumbai, December 14th, 2003. I took AA from Chicago to Paris, what I didn’t know was the AI flight was also Chicago to Paris with a layover in Paris. 

When I got on, a gujju lady was beside me with her granddaughter. She made a make shift camp bed infront of our legs for her kid. I’m 6’2, it was impossible for me to move. As a meek 17 year old then, I didn’t say a word, not that it would matter anyway, she didn’t know Hindi, first time I realised not all Gujarati people speak Hindi. I even filled out their immigration leaflet before deboarding. 

I worked at a hotel in Mauritius for an year, surprisingly not many entitled Indian stories, even though 50% of our guests were Indian. My opinion:
1. Pure overreaction, can’t point this as Indian behaviour.
2. Ughh,  hate such idiots
3. Only beatings can cure such things
4. May be only such people get a pass to be there
5. While many country tourists are stereotyped for their behaviour and this one is just typical Indian. Indian family in an American restaurant they act like they are entitled to everything and act they literally own the restaurant. I work in a fine dining restaurant and we have jazz music every Wednesday. The family walked in demanded Indian classical be played by the band. WTF..... This is why most servers don't want an Indian table in restaurant and they won't tip no matter what. Was flying back from europe, had two inbreds in the seat behind me. They realised that alchohol on the flight was free and proceeded to hound the air hostess for drinks for the first 2-3 hours. Then once drunk they started watching videos on their phone without headphones. After a couple of minutes other passengers complained to the staff and they finally stopped.

After a few hours of nonsense like this, one of the apes decided that 8 glasses of airplane whiskey didn't agree with his stomach and decided to puke all over the aisle. So for the last 4 hours of my flight I had to deal with the stench of stomach acid and partly digested airplane food. \#5: had it been in US, both of those clowns would've been dragged out for some ""special interrogation"" I was in Australia for an onsite project.
In the community gym ,there was this particular indian women who used to bring her 2-3 year old grand kids to the gym . These kids were quite a nuisance.
 
I once told her that if your grandkids aren't interested in gymming ,then why are you bringing them . Her reply was ' Humne bhi paisa bhara hain , aap Kaun ho bolnewale '. i dont know about abroad but in hyderabad one guy standing in 10th row was pushing everyone to get ahead as soon as the plane landed. I tried to stop him but he pointed to his wife, I let him go thinking she was unwell. When i got down i saw him clicking selfies with his wife in front of the bus. Let's be honest, all countries/nationalities are assholes. Just see how white people go to developing countries and beg for us to fund their ""finding themselves"" trip

I know it's a lil whataboutism, but other countries already hate us. Just see how white people on Reddit are very quick to point out that we smell of Curry and spices, when they themselves can't properly clean their asses and smell of poop (bidet masterrace> toiler paper)

Seriously, don't get into this self hate thing. Majority of Indians are respectful, it's basically numbers game. If 10% of uk is annoying, thats 6 million. If 10% of India is annoying, that's 150 million I've seen a lot of us haggle the people from customer service for free upgrades/meals/discounts. The game plan is simple ,doesn't matter if its flight or a hotel or any other place in the hospitality industry. 

They go in with the cheapest plan/ticket/reservation and then look for some god damn stupid reason to complaint to the customer service reps. They wont stop stop complaining/arguing till they get something free, it could be a better room, better seat on a flight, free meal anything. 

And the worst part is that once they get something free of cost they will go and brag about this to their friends and family as if they did something great. Its so annoying listening to people and their cheap adventures. Number 3. as mentioned by OP, legit happened to me and a friend, the first time we were in Pattaya,we were turned away from a couple of establishments and when it made sense that this is because of being Indian we were extremely shocked. We had no other option but to show Australian ID and currency we were carrying to show that we came from Australia. Whenever I made friends with foreigners online they would, without fail, comment on how different I am from the Indians they see. It's an easy halo effect, so I don't mind. This was from Holi last year. There is a very nice little stretch in Jersey City, US ( one in the kal ho na ho ) and it’s really nice to just sit out there and look at the NYC skyline at sunset. 

Imagine my horror to see holi colors all over the deck and it’s just not isolated, there was pichkari stains and gulal and it was just disgusting. I mean fucking play holi but clean up after your mess. It was really disappointing to see that there are so inconsiderate people. Long line at immigration point at Helsinki Airport. A pair middle aged woman and man pushing and showing through the line to get in front loudly proclaiming ""we are senior citizens."" With that stupid hand gesture and head wobble. As if being senior citizen means something in Scandinavia. Get a bloody free wheelchair if you can't stand or walk. Going down from Zugspitze, Germany by cable car, this huge group of middle aged Indians shouting on top of their voices, ""How's the josh?...High sir!"". Was super embarassing to share the cable car with them smh. lol this thread is depressing I was on my flight from Jeddah(KSA) to New Delhi. Once on board flight attendant started handing out blankets to anyone who have asked. As soon he started distributing literally every Indian around started shouting on him Sir ji me, sir mujhe bhi, me me, here, sir here etc. it was so loud that it make everyone uncomfortable. At this point the flight attended said in Hindi, ‘ Bhai, yeh khana nahi hai’. Guess what, attendant was Russian. I've got something similar on three occasions;

1. I've travelled every year of my life since I was born as my parents lived and worked abroad. So, I've witnessed all sorts of chaos and woe that Indian's occasionally, bring in flights and the regular things like standing in the aisle even before the plane has come to a stop etc.I remember recently on a flight from the middle east a few people got up and made a queue before the seatbelt signs were turned off and the plane was still moving. One man sitting near the door, told them to stop making the queue so early and they said we've been waiting to return to India for a few years and he responds quickly, ""Jab saalo wait kar liya to do minute me kya jaiga tumhara. Baith jaiye.""On a few flights, I'd see people bring in luggage greater than the weight allotted to them and in order to evade the extra baggage fee, they'd stall the line for boarding pass and ask if they can check-in their luggage with us as we generally packed light for frequent travel. If we've had reached our luggage limit and politely refuse, they'd ask the next guy in line.
2. I was returning via bus from LA to SF and there was written baggage limitation on the bus ticket of two bags. It was also explicitly mentioned in bold red that no leeway would be given for extra baggage.Then comes this news reporter and her mother with six huge suitcases. Everyone has handed over their luggage and got it stored in the storage of the bus. I was travelling with an Indian friend at the time, we had one suitcase each. We're queuing up to get onto the bus and she's there arguing with the bus conductor. He refused to entertain them. He told them to either get on the bus or get off.She then seeing us in the queue comes to us and asks if we have luggage left to check-in. I agreed as it was delaying the bus departure and she got her way.When we went to the bus conductor he looked at us and then said that every time an Indian would come and they'd always exceed the luggage limit and we shouldn't let her get her way. I said, we're also Indian and if we have space, then do this once and we can depart quickly.We made the reporter promise to the conductor that she'd not check in more luggage on her return journey. She got all happy and gave us her business card, a reporter for some big News TV corp. We didn't care. But, the delay she caused in departure made everybody very angry with us. My friend even said, ""Jaane do inko! Phasne do! India smajh baithi hain ye log!"".
3. This one was unique; There was a guy adamant about smoking aboard the plane while in flight. Flight attendants and people will keep telling him to stop. He'd put out the cigarette and then light it again after some time. The flight attendant snatched his lighter he was hiding and cigarettes. Asked for his passport and visa. He was then promptly arrested upon disembarkation as soon as he was through the immigration check.

Please, everybody, when you travel, make sure you read the rules on the tickets ahead of the journey. There's been quite a few occasions when I witnessed Indian travelers acting really stuck up and entitled and treating service personnel like crap, though that mostly applies to the middle income crowd.  Try flying business or first class and every Indian passenger would make an average Westerner look like an uncivilized savage.  Switch to cattle class and everyone acts like they're one of the Great Mughals and demands they're treated as such. We were in Athens boarding the metro from the airport to the city. Since it was the first station, the train was stopped till its departure time. An Indian uncle was standing near the open door (just outside) and smoking. At least two announcements were made saying that the train is about to depart, so please board. This guy just put one leg inside the train and waited. Then the doors started shutting, and he tried to claw the door open  multiple times. Since the doors weren't shut, the train couldn't leave, and he wasn't strong enough to claw them open completely. He finally managed to wriggle his leg outside, and the train was able to leave. There is a statue called The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen, Denmark. I saw grown-up Indians trying to climb the statue (not too tall) to pose for a picture. Was on a flight from Dubai to LA and had a bunch of Telugu uncles (they tisko-cheezeko-ed their way to cowboy land) in the row behind me. They really were having a ball and seemed to be first time travellers based on the way they were trying to enjoy everything to the hilt. What really irked me was the way they would keep calling the hostesses - we were sitting very close to the pantry area, so they would just hail, ""Aye, babbyy, waater waater"" or ""Aye, bebbie, 3 beers"" or Aye, babbee, some chicken/nuts aa?"" since they wanted their drinks and chakna on their laps whenever their hearts desired. One of them would replace ""babbyy"" with ""medam, medam"". And do note, they didn't seem to use those words deridingly (no followup laughter and all) - they just seemed to know that those were the words to refer to a non-desi woman. What baffled me most was how the hostesses seemed to be completely okay with those calls and would respond to them every time with smiles and actually even serve them what they wanted. All that just confused and irritated the shit outta me and I did nothing but just sulk. ""Burger hai bhaijaan, bomb nahin"" would also be an appropriate line to say after one rips out a nice fat one, which is quite common from our countrymen and women on such long flights, what with all the airline food and beverages floating inside. Indian uncles and aunties eating Biryani, Roti, Curd rice, Lemon rice in NYC near the charging bull statue. That's the worst thing I have ever seen because lot of other tourists come to that place. What's wrong with sharing a beer? Man the first story made me so mad . Why doesn't the DGCA start banning these entitled fucks from flying? A few years ago me and my father were at this pizza place in Arizona where you need to put your own boxes in the trash,and we saw this massive Indian family just leave everything on the table and then go. It was so embarrassing,the staff looked very incensed. My dad went over and apologized for their behaviour. There was a time when I came to know I was the idiot . 

So I was just walking in a town in South East Asia and I saw a girl selling fruit salad . I just said  her get me one in a loud tone just like we do in India and she was pissed like anything . I realised my folly when I saw a Caucasian couple buying the same stuff with so much civility . 

When you are travelling in a group , the whole group is as civil as the most uncivilised person . We went to a French bakery and they had this number plate on table system . Our girls went so crazy with selfies , food pics etc , it was literally a Commotion . French staff was really kind and just pointed out that please make sure that number is visible. 

To be honest , these white people overdo stuff. To much of ""Thank You"" but we need to be more humble as well. I was on a flight from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi, flying the new (at that time) Etihad Airbus A380 which is basically a double decker. The bottom I think was all economy and the top was business and the really fancy first class apartment style seats. A lot of people in economy were really curious to see the apartment style seats and asked the crew to allow them to go up there and they were obviously denied since that would disturb the passengers up there. 

When we reached AUH, everyone had to exit to the front of the plane where there also happened to be stairs to the top. A flight attendant was standing there to ensure that noone strayed to the top. As I was exiting, right in front of me was an Indian man with his perhaps 8 year old son. We could hear the attendant telling a lot of people on their way out that they wouldn't be allowed up there, so even though I was curious myself, I had decided I wouldn't ask to go up. 

As we got to where the attendant was standing, someone from the other aisle asked him a question and he turned to deal with them. The man in front of me, seized this opportunity to try and sneak past the attendant. He started climbing the stairs along with his son and had one eye on the attendant the whole time to make sure he didn't turn. The attendant did of course, soon turn, and had to give this man a dressing down. 

It was soo embarrassing.....a grown man getting told off in front of his son for not being able to listen to simple instructions, as if they apply to everyone but him :/ Well, mine must be the battery Park in new York City. All of us are waiting in line, when a Gujarati family, a old batshit crazy mother and her two sons decide that they are too good to be waiting with us peasants, so they literally go under the tape only to be stopped by security and given a surprise *insert surprised Pikachu face* that they're in the United States, not India. Then the sons try to cuss and scream at the female security guard (they're probably not frequent tourists and haven't got accustomed to the concept of female security guards) about random stuff and how they're gonna sue her of all she's worth. She calmly calls the cops on them and they are dragged away in a NYPD police car, with handcuffs, while the whites are muttering stuff about Indians under their breath, and my girlfriend and I are praying to whatever God exists that we look non Indian enough, and start talking in Japanese for everyone to hear. What I find frustrating on every inbound flight from Asian destinations.. People scrambling to get their bags out of overhead luggage compartments as soon as the plane lands and is taxiing..no one gives a fuck about safety and create total chaos putting the crew in a difficult place... It's not like you are getting anywhere till the doors are opened. Hate that such nauseating actions reflect poorly on the rest of us pleasant folk. >4.....

I really think this should be far more common around the world.  Caning is quicker, cheaper, and people will definitely remember it more than a fine. I do want to clarify, not all Indians behave like this. Just a few from rural areas and some uneducated. There are many decent Indians who do not do this. The later are increasing by the day as more people immigrate to urban areas and education increases. Stay where you are mate.",AskIndia,2019-07-31 01:43:00
[AskIndia] Help me deal with an asshole tenant,79,cq5tzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cq5tzw/askindia_help_me_deal_with_an_asshole_tenant/,27,"Background: I rented my house to friend's acquaintance after a referral; he was a decent working guy with two kids. Since I repainted the house a week before and he needed a house for just a year; I did not put clause to painting cost of the house in the agreement, how much damage you could make in an year right!?

Fast forward to one year: **The agreement ended in the Feb 2019**, he stayed in the house until end of the May 2019, **without paying rent for three months**

And his kids thrashed the house completely. There was crayons scribbles everywhere, mud everywhere, even adults drew rangoli on the wall!

Now: I told him, I will deduct unpaid rent, the cost of painting, and to fix broken things from the security deposit. The guy is acting like complete asshole, locking the front gate and not returning the keys to the house, until I repay the security deposit in full!

I am replacing the locks to the house, consult the lawyer.



What are my other options? I don't really care about the money at this point, all want is the guy to pay for the damages.

Edit: added missing details

Edit 2: here's few pictures https://imgur.com/a/H6BPXLC",prashantvc," Never let a tenant stay even a minute beyond the lease date. No matter how well you know the person. This puts you and your property at immense risk incase things turn sour.


Security deposit is kept exactly for these situations- damage to the property. Furthermore, the rent for the time he has been living should be adjusted from the security deposit. You need to involve a paper trail ASAP. 


Involve the police and send him a legal notice if need be. First priority should be to get him out of the house. Police should help out here. But vamilies don't trash rented places. Only vaachalars do.

Hope you have taken pictures of the damages. Discriminate against bachelors more. ""Decent guy with 2 kids"" lol I hope you're not in Bengal cause the West Bengal Tenency Act leaves you no room to manoeuvre . Best i suggest is either cut off electricity/water/supplies or go to the local thana. They'll make a call and that sorts out most issues. Or tell any police friends you might have to call and threaten them on your behalf. He doesn't really have any standing . Do not get dragged into court no matter what!!!

Good luck Not an expert on this, but just get a cop in there? [removed] I think the interest on the security deposit alone would be enough to make up for the lost rent :) He cannot legally lock you out. Lawyer up.

5. watching more netflix and amazon prime",cleanstart92," Wait was porn banned? 

Thankfully my ISP (ANI network) haven't blocked it so eventually no effects.  `watching more netflix and amazon prime`

Hmm, that last point is interesting....shouldn't it have been AltBalaji? Also what exactly do you watch on Netflix and prime as a substitute? [deleted] Website ban has never affected me, as I've been using VPNs for a very long time. Anyways.... Recently, I shared my VPN credentials with a friend of mine. And the first thing she said was this.... https://i.imgur.com/YYJ1rMR.jpg 😂              

Porn ban did affect her in the past, but not anymore. I had the pavlovian reaction of getting a erection whenever I looked at the VPN app on the homepage so I had to remove it. I’ve always used torrent to download premium porn i.e Brazzers, NA, BangBros, etc etc 

So i don’t care. 

Never was a fan of tube porn. Yes. It helps my r/NoFap journey. Most of the comments didn't mention Torr browser which I feel is much easier and free.

Is there any con with the browser? No way My Broadband provider didn't banned any porn. In case of Mobile data, i don't visit mainstream sites which are banned by mobile service provider, so for me nothing affected. To visit any blocked site i use Puffin Browser which always opens blocked sites. like i advised last time someone posted a huge thread , opera browser has free VPN. Use that browser and enjoy your porn without any restriction. The locations are Us eu sea regions. At home , i have a local ISP so nothing's banned but on Airtel I use opera browser, the speeds are okayish and it's convenient. All the porn ban has done is made me use a VPN. I use my imagination more. Haven't affected me much cause I haven't been watching it often the last couple of years. I'm just over thirty and have watched it somewhat at least once a month since I was 13. I've always been religious though. So I've always tried not to do it. Did NoFap for some years and something clicked two years ago. I mean I still end up watching porn once every three or four months but it's not terribly exciting. It has to be said, it's super annoying when I watch it but don't get a big hit of dopamine like did when I was a teen. In the end I'm like, 'All this sinning for *this*?' lol. So yeah, I haven't felt the impact of the ban. There were a few times I tried to access the sites and saw that it was banned. I just shrugged and moved on.

For example, walking shoes are expected to give out after about 700 kms, which should be about a year under regular use. Asics Gel Lyte would last you a long time. Also they're the best for running. Any sports shoe, at long as you don't use it. I have had Reebok, Puma and Fila.

Can I answer? 

...yeah, she's the only one. Nevermind. You need a serious tag here First I'll say it obligatory that I'm not attractive.
People keep staring at me wanting to engage or strike a conversation. but I'm an introvert and like to keep to myself. Not to be immodest or self gratuitous but its kinda weird that people stare at you in envy or maybe thats just me. Ok so not great looking and stuff, but I did become significantly better looking after losing weight. I'm told I'm ""cute"". It was a world of a difference with regards to my confidence and peoples perspective of me.

People treat me nicer when I'm thinner. I've been on dates with some very pretty girls and all round excellent human beings with interesting backgrounds (models, actresses, chefs, entrepreneurs etc.) Being more attractive than my past self has gotten me more attention and positive interest for the most part. People are also less harsh with their first impression of you. I'm not that good looking that people envy me, so yeah there's that. My friend is great looking.

So he gets a lot of female attention in general ( nature , you know )

He was in 2 or 3 platonic relationship ( wow ) 

Lots of crushes

Gets his work done ( from his admirers of course )

But still he is down to earth and humble. People just stare continuously, it's very very annoying, but I just learnt to ignore and pretend as if nothing's happening.

I feel bad for girls, They have it much much worse. Physical looks of a man don't matter much if it's not matched by confidence and certain badness. It's a mixed bag, you get better treatment from women in general and you end up having a few crazy girls with crushes on you etc. And some guys will absolutely hate you because you will make them feel insecure about their looks.

[AskIndia] Is it just me or are most of the gym trainers across our nation unqualified?,424,bxsezi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bxsezi/askindia_is_it_just_me_or_are_most_of_the_gym/,196,"What's your experience?
Here are the things I've heard gym trainers say in a couple of cities in India (translated).

""You won't gain weight now. It's summer, you will sweat too much to gain weight.""

""You don't need to do warm-ups dude. Just lift."" (This guy came three weeks later with his shoulder in a sling. Kya hua? Dislocate ho gaya)

""You *have* to do 15 reps, everything else is wrong. 3 sets of 6? How will the muscle get stimulated?""

""Compound exercises are for 'fitness'. Isolation exercises are for muscle building.""

""Optimum Nutrition? *ON*?? Koi local brand hoga..""

""Don't listen to doctors. Doctors themselves come to my gym."" (said by the same guy who said don't warm up).

**EDIT**: BONUS:
""Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

EDIT2: Yes, The Bonus actually isn't bad. There's an argument for it. But I'll leave it here, as a testament to my own fallibility. And because ""phaavda leke.. "" sounds badass.",MauryanEmperor," I've trained for 5.5 years in NCR, hopping gyms every 6-12 months. I've been to some cheap gyms (INR 800/month) and been to some relatively expensive chains (bomiso, anytime fitness) and one thing is pretty common - the trainers all suck.   


In fact, in my experience, the most knowledgeable gym trainer I've met was at the cheapest gym - he owned the gym, and was running it in the basement of an actual residence.   


Here's how I've learnt to deal with the pseudo-trainers:   
1. Make them know their place: They're there to help you *if and only if you ask for help.* You've paid for the membership, which means you can use the equipment. You're under no obligation to listen to 'trainers'.   
2. Be courteous, but distant with them. Say ""I have my routine, I'm doing this."" Many trainers will just leave you alone, thinking you already have another plan, or know more than them (which is actually very probable)  
3. Follow your routine to a T, so you can impress the same guys with your results, in silence.   


Best of luck! I've been going gym since 2008 and have trained quite a lot of people for free, I can confirm that majority of trainers don't even know the names and proper form of exercise. Let alone talking about compound and isolation exercises. Gyms don't have a degree requirement so every gym bro or even a newbie can apply to become a trainer and then keep fucking up everyone else body. That's just exercise. Most of the people don't even know about nutrition and stuff. They will just point you to the nearest supplement counter. The deadlift one is actually correct. It's called a mixed grip, it improves stability and prevents the barbell from slipping. You need to alternate your underhand and overhand when using mixed grip so that you don't develop muscle imbalance. ""It's damn hot, can you turn on the AC?""  

""It's good if it's hot, you'll sweat more so become thinner.""  

WTF.png I got lucky when I started going to gym where there was a trainer in his 40s who knew almost everything there is about fitness that was in 2010. And now in Bangalore these trainers literally doesn't even know to teach pushups in correct form. Be careful when you choose to join a gym. Any should or knee joint issues will affect you throughout your life. Dude ,I have been lifting for 3 years and have even helped my friends in transformation,till now I have not seen a single trainer or even a competitor who knows his shit. I have even trained with Mr.UP and he doesn't know shit about training. These people are complete jackass . Most of these guys use PEDs told to them by some trainer and then suffer. You can check tarun Gill's channel on YouTube and not even 1 competitor knew his shit,1 of them was telling to stop bathing before competition. [deleted] I've been to 3 gyms in Bangalore including cult fitness and yes the trainers don't know shit. I would have got tendinitis if I continues with the cult fitness class. To be honest most of our workforce except the creamy layer need to be trained and retrained. This is the pain which comes with a growing nation. For instance, try looking for a handyman who is competent. It's really hard, or they are already working for a big company. The money they get from the jobs is also not so high so they don't put their heart and soul into this so they can make things better. Hopefully with growth of economy our country's workforce skills also grow up I used to go to a gym for a while (2014-15) and one of the trainers straight up told me to take some steroids cause I'm too skinny. Optimum nutrition



😂😂 True that. 

A lot of trainers focus on unnecessary things or sound phony asf. 

From what I've seen, Cult seems to carry some good trainers with good certifications.

Most of all, all the trainers that I've visited or seen are self made, they built a good body and then became a trainer because of the money. 
So they don't exactly know the scientific way but the way that worked for them. 

Either way, I see most Indians go through a lot of YouTube channels and blogs and pick what suits them best. 

My buffy buddies are all from the same method. I have gone to some form of gym for the past 4-5 years. For 2 years, when I went to the normal gym, I was doing squats wrong and no one told me about this (I dont know if it is because they didnt know or because of not giving a fuck since they are underpaid).  And many of them focus on isolation exercises and not compound or functional exercises which is a huge problem. 

I went to a functional fitness (not crossfit but similar) gym 3 years ago and that is where I came to know about Squats, Deadlift etc. But here too, the main trainer knows his stuff well while others do not. 

These trainers are also trying to sell either protein powder or dietician none of which I wanted. This is because they are earning about 15-25k per month (which is quite less for the amount of hours they put in tbh). These trainers make their money from personal training and hence maybe the lack of interest that you see around. 

Another important thing that all gyms across the country lack is their ignorance of cooldown. Most gyms do not focus on cooldown while those that do, do not spend more than 10 mins. I learnt it the hard way by going to the physiotherapist and spending 5k for rehabilitation. 

Currently, I go to the gym in my building itself. the trainer there is good, but doesnt know enough compound exercises. 

IMO, if you are looking at only fitness and have no huge goals, you can workout at home itself because there are a lot of online channels posting workout videos. All you need is a pair of dumbells  and a mat. Have been lifting for over 6 years, this should come as no surprise to you, there’s no regulation. 

Unfortunately you’re going to have to do your own homework on the internet and use your head to navigate the bro-science. 

While I lived in bombay I used to go to Nitrro, the membership was quite steep but the trainers knew their stuff there. But for the most part elsewhere, for sure, clueless. Certified trainers anywhere in the world will cost a fortune!

I have been working out for a long time without a trainer, using my own routine and have had fairly good results.

I recommend sites such as scoobys workshop (funny name but totally worth it) and the forums of bodybuilding dot com. The thing to keep in mind is that it takes time to build muscle and get sustainable results. There is no quick solution and any person giving quick results is either a liar or will end up hurting you. Yes. As with all fields in India which are technical.

If any of you want to learn to lift or whatever, just go to [https://startingstrength.com/](https://startingstrength.com/) Welcome bro. I use Jim wendlers routine which you can find online or buy his book. And use my trainer mostly as a spotter so that I don’t go bad form and break my back. I think that’s the best way to use Indian trainers and yes creating a routine and dieting wise they all suck according to me. This really depends on the franchise gym you go to. 

&#x200B;

Background : I used to go to Gold's gym in Chennai (think it was the first branch they opened in the country) and the trainers were all top notch. Even in Maverick's (FLUX now, I think) the trainers knew what they were talking about, and a good proportion of them were looking to get further certifications in the fitness industry. 

&#x200B;

I suppose it's a pretty banal case of you get what you pay for. The fitness industry, like a host of other industries, that have arrived in India needs some time to mature I suppose. The bonus isn't that bad. Pros usually deadlift with a mixed grip, it prevents the bar from slipping too much when compared to a double overhand grip. That's because when the bar starts to roll out of one hand, it rolls **into** the other.

Here are things the trainer at my gym said (I don't pay him, he's the owner too):

1. Heavy weights build size and no strength.
2. Do light weights with 25+ reps for fat loss.
3. Lat exercises reduce love handles
4. Side bends reduce love handles

People I know have had it worse than me. Their trainer made them do all machine workouts the first day, and full body workout every day for a month or so. And they went to posh gyms!

So yes, Indian trainers are pretty bad. Mainly because we don't have the level of education here which is possessed, or required to be possessed, by someone of that nature. Most here follow broscience of ""shock the muscle"". The trainer at my gym doesn't even know what Starting Strength and 5/3/1 are! Warming up has a lot of different connotations.

Warming up with lighter weights to practice form before the lifts? That's good.

Warming up by running on the treadmill for 10 minutes then practicing judo kicks for the next 10 before you actually pick up weights? Not productive. How to detect a bad trainer : Ask his opinion on leg curls and upright rows. If he approves of either of these, he's a bad trainer. Depends

I have been going to Gold Gym for last 4 years, and the one I train under is great

But it sucks for the wallet The body shape of most gym trainers in India says everything it has to about untrained gym trainers in India. Gym trainers in India are basically people who have spent a shit load of time in or around gyms I have seen quite a few trainers who don't know much but have somehow built a good physique, but there are also others I have met who REALLY know their shit as well as the science behind building muscles, something like the Athlean X guy. I'm never gonna forget the way one of them described chest exercises to me, the way they're supposed to be done...what people do wrong etc. Unfortunately that person rarely offers personal training and owns the gym lol Does anyone here know how good the cult.fit classes are? Especially the boxing classes? > Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

I have seen guys do that. what's the logic of doing that? I have foudn vice versa also, many people are not even willing to listen to sound advice, since sound advice requires working on form and technique. People in my gym do half squats without wanting to put in effort to master below parallel depth. Some do close grip bench with very close grip, fuck wrists. Lift arms all the up top in dumbbell rows. And despite my reasoning (some of these are friends), most just stay on, since they can lift heavier weights this way with poor form. People however flock to model/trainer in my gym who looks better than me :/. I dont know where you live but i live in vasai and in my local gym there are certified trainers. I have been training for more than 7 years . Most of the trainers  who are certified are always looking for clients because they earn more throught clients than spending more amount of time being employed inthe gym. My advice is do your research. If you are willing to invest time and money in the gym you should invest some time in picking up a routine and progressively overload. Most trainers suck. They offer diet advice even when they know they are not supposed to. They don't understand that rep range depends upon fitness and advice 15 reps to everyone.the good thing is I've met some good trainers. They don't try to force their methods on everyone. I lucked out way back in the day and ended up with a high level powerlifter as a trainer. He was into heavy lifts, low reps and a LOT of rest in between sets. 

I lucked out in joining the gym. It was cheap, great equipment, empty most of the time so the trainer had nothing else to do but chat with me and give fitness tips. Wow, a lot going on here. I have been trying to get fit and get regular at a gym but I don't know what should I do. I am not experienced with the equipment and gym instructors only help out in the initial few days of joining a gym. Any ideas where I can learn the movements and how to do them safely, I'd like to avoid injury at all costs.  I have tried watching tutorials on youtube but it there is too much noise there to make senseful plan. Gymming veterans please help guide me. > BONUS: ""Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

This one is correct advice, but you don't need to do this for lower weights. As you stack more weights, the chance of slipping goes up. Also, when you lift the plates can spin a little because both your wrists are facing the same direction. The momentum can be enough to cause the barbell to spin out from your hand. 

TBH, i've seen lot of bro-sciency stuff even in the west. Trainers who keep updating their knowledge are the best ones. Ones who haven't will tell you it's ok to do lat pull downs behind your neck like they used to 20 years ago. Anytime fitness here pays general trainers like 10k for 8 hours shifts. A good occasionally competing trainer eats 30-40k  a month.  Senior trainers are also some 3-6 months certified ones with 2-3 years of lifting experience.

&#x200B;

But this thing is fading with the ecoms and these new Indian youtubers like Jeet Salal, Gaurav Taneja, Mybollywood Body, Guru mann, Sangram Chougule, Sahil Khan etc. So these trainers nowadays are mainly just for spotting weights or running an illegal steroid cycle. What gyms have you heard these from? Supporter nhi phnega toh ""chhota"" ho jayega "" paani bhar jayega"" I have learned the proper forms, techniques and workouts from YouTube. Yup they are. They also practice the worst bro science and will just take juice to get their body. 

If you wanna join a fitness and health discord server to discuss gym, supplements, diet share your progress etc.. 

https://discord.gg/uCgERhW [deleted] Ur right. Thats the case with 90 percent of the trainers. These guys are filled with bro science and have at some point in their life and/or currently taken steroids, to get their body where it is now. 

These idiots also peddle steroids / growth hormones / growth hormone releasing peptides to young naive gym goers to help reach the ideal 'instagrammable' physique. 


Off late these dumb fuck trainers have discovered muscle building content on youtube via fake natties and sellouts, further fuelled with social media and popular forums and are again peddling misinformation and bad plans to people.  There seems to be no end to this chutiyapa. 

People need to have thier eyes opened to the right information. Yes [deleted] [deleted] Darebee.com for routines and freeweight exercises This is very true One guy who used to train in our gym for a few years off and on has now become a trainer for a reputed gym brand (I won't say the name as I don't want him to get in trouble). Apart from the fact that he weighs barely more than a feather, we know that he doesn't know a thing about exercises, let alone nutrition and stuff. So, yeah, that's bound to happen. Also, most of them force you to increase the weight, without asking you to do so progressively, infact they don't even care about form, which is really important Ratio of gym patrons with fit bodies to unfit bodies is surprisingly high at my gym. I'd think the trainers do a good job here. Why would you call yourself a bad trainer? I started training in 2014 and have been training for the better part of last 5 years in Hyderabad. I have been to multiple gyms from cheap to the expensive ones(Core fitness). In my experience most of the gym trainers that i have met and conversed with don't know anything about training and bodybuilding. Most of trainers that i have encountered are just a bunch of guys who trained for a few years using PED's and steroids being completely clueless about basics of training, supplementation and  nutrition. Infact, most of them are just there to sell you products like protein powders, BCAA's, Creatine and that too fake ones. Even most of the youtubers present in Indian bodybuilding community like Rohit Khatri, Tarun Gill etc do not provide science based empirical studies and evidence behind their exercises and videos and is just bro science. I personally find youtubers like Seth Feroce([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkZuCxXdE6OUGDEbETcjhPw)) and  Jeff Nipard([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/icecream4PRs))  the best in the industry when it comes to sharing knowledge relating to supplements, exercises, importance of warmups, gear amongst other things. I have learnt the most from their youtube channels amongst all the youtubers that i used to follow.

It's good to see educated gym goers like you guys who actually give a shit about things like form, compound movements,proper warmup etc. I hope I can meet some of you in real life someday and share the love for working out. A beginner 17M here with 95Kg weight. Anybody can help suggest me something? Guys , I agree with mostly all of you. But koi mujhe yeh batao ki original supplements aur Sahi rates Mai kaha milenge? Flipkart aur Amazon pe Mai chutiya katwa chuka hu. On a completely different note, have you tried training with kettlebells? The stuff will turn you into a beast. I'm never going back to isolation workouts. You're not alone with this kind of experience This is an example of a job that can pay better in India than outside of India. 

I knew an American who made excellent money gym training in Mumbai, better than he would have back in the US. Tl;Dr version of my answer is yes. My trainer is completely aversive to suggest supplements but gives some bs advices at times. The most ridiculous being his diet charts. Follow the r/fitness wiki and the website exrx.net As someone who is deciding to make a career in fitness (starting as personal trainer), Which institute do you guys suggest?  

So far I've heard of K11, ACE, ACSM, IFSI, Gold's. I've failed 12th std, so can't do ACE or ACSM, their sites say that 12th is required as qualification.

How long it will took to become completely bald or visibly bald?",meinBhiEngineer," It's testosterone mate. You've got too much. Ever seen some unfortunate old person begging on the street, his head full of hair? Do you think it's the water he uses? 

Water and environment might have some passing effect, but if it's in your genes, consider yourself fucked out of a full lush head of hair. 

Makes me cry everytime. Bangalore can make you go bald due to the ground water that some parts of the city uses. Check for water quality. Hard water does that. Check water quality. Hard water can make your hair brittle There are so many reasons for balding:

Genetic

Hormonal

Hard water

Autoimmune 

Last but the best, EVOLUTION (You don't need them to survive so if you're balding and all the other causes are ruled out then consider yourself to be on the forefront of evolution). It's an advantage. Avoid stress, keep your scalp always clean- no dandruff and shit. This worked for me. So, after moving to Bangalore, my hair started turning grey. Moved back home and the grey is almost gone now. Genetics are the main reason for early balding. Your maternal grandfather's hair is a generally a good indicator for your hair health. If he faced balding problems early in his life, there is a good chance of you facing them too.
Stress, diet, haircare and exercise definitely help but if your genetics are the cause of your balding, you're going to face a tough time dealing with it. 
Consult a trichologist who'll give you better insights about it. All I can say mate is go buzz. It's due to genes. But still there may be chances that it's temporary. So don't stress, no gel, no wax and go buzz. See the result overtime. And more advice is stop \*cough\*... \*cough\* fapping for sometime(may not be necessary).",AskIndia,2019-07-07 23:13:53

All in moderation is healthy The brits have a saying about 5 a day, which is 5 fruit and veg in a day. I try to keep that up with cheap ingredients.

Lentils are cheap and a good source of fibre and protein. So dal with rice, then whatever cheap seasonal veggies I can get my hands on. Bottle gourd, spinach, cauliflour etc. I make a batch of poriyal with each one, then mix and match for a week. Different lentils so I don't feel like I'm having the same thing over and over.

Idli with sambar is cheap too. 

Eggs, in different ways. Like in fried rice with some veggues left after making a big batch of poriyal. Or egg curry with idli.

When buying chicken, I buy the whole thing. I use the legs for curry, breasts for something like chicken 65, leftover meat for salad. The bones make a good stock, which can be used with the eggs and leftover meat for Chinese sweet corn chicken soup.

The trick is to learn how to use every ingredient in many things, as well as how to repurpose leftovers in a different tasting dish. I used these dishes when I was in India, and now that I live in a very expensive country, I use them even more. I just replace Indian veggies with the local cheap ones like broccoli and zucchini. Sattu ka sherbet Oats for breakfast- there's deal on Amazon every two weeks or from dmart add few Slices fruits and milk. Eggs, peanuts, spinach. Chicken.

Edit: soy beans basic food stuff is already pretty cheap in india, not sure how much cheaper you can get. Daal, roti, eggs, in season veggies and fruits, chicken breast(debatable if it's cheap but from a protein/cost ratio it's one of the better deals out there), dahi etc. Basically Ghar ka khaana but with a little more emphasis on protein and veggies rather than the carbs and snacking on fruits, dahi, nuts(expensive yes but alternatives like pumpkin seeds etc exist). We're lucky we get fresh food at a very reasonable rate and we have the eat cheap and healthy sorted out for us Idli **If you cooking at home:**

* Boiled Eggs 5 INR Each 7P6F
* Chicken 30 Rs per meal 50P10F
* Paneer 45 Per meal 30P40F
* Chhole/Rajma/Soya/Peanuts/Other Lentils= \~100 INR per Kg
* Ghee 400/KG
* Rice and Potato/Sweet Potato/Banana for carbs.
* Cucumbers, Spinach, Carrot,  Cauliflower, Cabbage, Tomato, Onion for basic Salad and unlimited seasonal veggies.

**Healthy, Cheaper, Transparent and Cleaner options i prefer when eating out:**

* Chicken/Paneer Tandoori/Tikka 100-200 INR for 300-400g
* Rajma/Chole Chawal
* Chicken/Mutton Biryanis
* Plain Milk, Curd. Oatmeal is relatively cheap here, easy to make and eat. Wheat roti and Gujrati dal. It's light and really filling. Eggs, rajma chili, roasted sweet potato , brown rice pulao , sprouts salad, sauted green veggies, nuts, upma, etc. Its not difficult once you learn what produce you can actually use, it just comes down to trial and error for what works for you. We Indians tend to consume a lot of carbohydrates and fats and minimal proteins. Those who advocate lentil based diets tend to miss the point that the quality of the proteins isn't comparable to animal based proteins. Another important point is the fact that diets high on lentils and fiber have less protein available for absorption though calculated values may far exceed the reality at the level of the small intestine. A diet based on animal protein is your best bet for good growth. Plant based proteins that can replace animal protein based diets are still expensive and not widely available. Oats with almonds Dal, sabzi, salad, roti/rice. Everything prepared in home Rice/Roti, daal and papad. Extremely easy to cook, cheap af. Sometimes add eggs to the meal. Dahi vada!

[AskIndia][Serious] Is it worth attempting immigration to Canada/ Australia for 1.6lpm-ers in India?,56,c4ilk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c4ilk5/askindiaserious_is_it_worth_attempting/,115,"Title. 

From what I understand based on armchair research: 
Motivation to immigrate: better future life for children in terms of clean water, air, education
Cons (probable): not the same standard of living as is currently?, slower professional growth, racism? 

Experienced immigrants/ those who are in similar shoes, please share your thoughts",aashish2137," NRI with a fairly neutral opinion here.

Some Cons that aren't always shared:
Expect a much quieter social life, a cultural gap in addition to a generational gap with your children, a reduced sense of self-identity, a lower standard of living and immense adjustment stress. 

Ofcourse you'll have more money after immigrating but it won't feel as luxurious as it sounds when one multiples dollars into rupees. If you enjoy a more self-involved lifestyle, it'll be easier to adjust. If you'd like, I'd be happy to chat over dm and answer more specific questions. I my opinion if you are looking for material happiness then immigrating is not a bad idea. What I mean by that? With just two months of salary in Canada you can actually afford a nice 60 inch LED TV, a sound bar and a nice couch. One year into job you can afford a muscle car like Camaro or Mustang (with loan ofcourse). You can also meet Indians and make new Indian friends by going to temples or other Indian group meeting that you look up on Facebook. 

But if you are a kind of guy who likes to be around family and friends, don't really care what car you are driving and the kind of house you are staying in then Canada might be boring. All in all I would say getting Luxury is easier in Canada/Australia than in India. But getting Family and friends is easier in India. And as someone already mentioned if you have Kids then the equation is entirely different. I migrated to Canada in 2017 - it's been a great experience for me so far, but it boils down to effort, luck and circumstances. 

My standard of life by local comparisons is definitely lower than my peers - a dollar goes a lot less than a rupee would in India. Having said that, though - I've never been a particularly money obsessed person. Give me a cot, 3 square meals and a roof over my head and I'm good, but I do appreciate that the quality of stuff I get here is substantially better for the amount I pay for it compared to India. 

Professional growth - I'd argue it's the opposite due to my specific circumstances. Employers let you Work from Home, some others (like mine) have an 'education allowance' to allow you to upskill on the company's dime, I get plenty of days off (5 day work week, statutory holidays means no work - it's actually straight up criminal and I get Christmas week (till New Year's off). Nobody questions/interrogates you if you want to take a few days off. I actually changed my role within the company because my own manager said I'd be a right fit for it and he helped me get the job. I love my coworkers and we get along very well. 

Racism - Can't speak for Australia but in Canada, it's mostly been low-key and barely noticeable if not non-existent (largely owing to the significant number of Indians already in Canada), outside of some clearly mentally ill people (the city of Toronto does a shitty job of looking after the mentally ill homeless people, especially now that it's summer and they're all around the city). 

I've already accepted the fact that neither side will truly accept me for what I am (Third Culture Kid, so not really fully Indian and not really super westernized, either) so the idea of a generational gap is already a forgone conclusion. 

Happy to answer any questions if folks are interested in learning more about the process or are generally just weighing options and want to know more about life in Canada - I also happen to run a landing group for new immigrants basically to help them with a social support structure as they get their sea legs after they land. It could be. 

You need to identify what pay in Canada/Australia is equivalent to the 1.6 lpm.  Then identify jobs that pay that in respective countries and then identify cities that would make your chances of achieving that better. 

For factors such as free/subsidized medical, education and to some extent a higher standard of living (to each his own). It is definitely worth doing it. 

Happy to answer in private too. Especially about Australia. Or even New Zealand. So this might be a one off case but even younger Indian who are in their 20s or 30s can experience a massive culture shock.

Eg 1 : My friend and his two kids stayed in Boston. So Indians are known as a race who hits their kid to discipline them (also  known as child abuse ). So his kid's friends and teachers had taught the kid that they can call the police if their parents hit them. 

His kids were the worst pieces of unruly shit I have ever laid my eyes upon. He and his wife literally went mad trying to discipline them. The kids used to threaten to call the police or complain to teacher if they hit them. So the parents were quite shocked and unable to control their kids. They eventually moved back to India.

Eg 2: if you are a conservative Indian, be prepared for your kids teenage years. They will date other people, probably indulge in casual sex, have secret alcohol parties. Dress skimpily and post tons of those pics on fb, Instagram etc. This is just pretty much inevitable and pretty common in the west. 

I have a modern friend who is well travelled, well read, rich and comfortable but just can't sleep because his teenage daughter was dating someone and loved partying and dancing. They can compromise on many things but kid's possible promiscuity is something they can't adjust to. 

This was few observations from a a decade ago or so. Depends on your line of work too, I guess. A 1.6 LPM friend of mine moved to Canada for MBA (he was in IT here before that) and struggled to find a job in business/management. So switched to IT after doing his MBA since he saw better job prospects here. Within Canada there are a lot of variations as well. Vancouver and Toronto metro areas are expensive and you will definitely have to sacrifice on some of your comforts. Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Winnipeg and Halifax are far more affordable. Halifax is a booming city now with a growing tech industry and pretty affordable. Canada isn’t as high paying as the US. But it’s offset by free healthcare, education & the environment there. It’s a massive pain to adjust to any new country. 

Even if you find a job that pays 100k CAD a year, the adjustments you need to make in terms of social settings will stay the same. 

But, depending on where in Canada you are for example GTA - you’ll find a robust Indian community. Canadians are in general more welcoming of immigrants vs other countries in the current scenario. 

Australia is just way too racist for my personal taste. They’ve a very rigid set of thinking & have an intellectual superiority complex in the work place & there is a Trump like PM in Australia now. Absolutely. I was a 1.6lpm before leaving. This was 2 years ago. It was totally worth it. I'd do it knowing what I know now. [deleted] [deleted] Yes, it is.",AskIndia,2019-06-24 13:11:18

From an environmentally-conscious citizen's point of view, try finding e-waste collecting agencies in your city. For example- [https://yourstory.com/2017/11/waste-management-startups/](https://yourstory.com/2017/11/waste-management-startups/) start up on this page. 

**My 2 cents** 

I had done a project on e-waste management in Delhi. The conclusion was that no one in India is recycling formally- the technology is too expensive and sending the waste to countries which have this waste recycling facility is not profitable. Hence, almost all of the waste that is collected by these so called ""formal sector"" collection and recycling firms ends up with informal e-waste recyclers which are found in and around Seelampur area in Delhi.

[AskIndia] What song is this ?,6,comakt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/comakt/askindia_what_song_is_this/,6,"Often when I think of home there is a particular Hindi pop a song plays in my head that was popular in the early 2003, the year I left home. I can recall only one line from the song and hum the tune of the same bit and nothing more. Over the years, I, for the life of me can't find the title of the track or singer. I've trawled through a several 2000s pop songs compilation on youtube, lyrics websites without much luck.

What I can remember: 

* **Genre**: Hindi pop song
* **Singer**: Male, lean and tall (at the time of filming)
* **Year**: 2003 or 2001 (A ""hit"" song during the month of CBSE board exam)
* **Lyrics**: (Not chorus) It goes by *kore kagaz ki tarah, adhoori (khali?) meri (hamari?) kahani hai* the next line is sung in the same tune. That is all I can recall. 
* **Music Video**: Filmed indoor with large open space, maybe just walls (dark) in an open field with no roof. Heavy wind blowing into the singer's face and all over the place (as you do). The singer wears sunglasses (totally unnecessary), dressed in black and he features in most of the video. He is stood in front of the car on occasions. The whole video has a dark blue hue and borderline black and white. 

That's all I can remember unfortunately. Frustratingly the song has been on the tip of my tongue for a fair few years and with every passing year it gets harder to bear the fact that I may die (not terminally ill) without ever being able to listen to this song once more. 

**TLDR**: Can't bear the fact I may never be able to find the song that reminds me of home and childhood memories.

In India if you are in a relationship, then you already are talking about marriage and how to convince your parents from day 1 of your relation. So there will hardly be any space or suspense to propose marriage. ""To hum rishtaa pakkaa samjhe?""


i.e. Shall we consider this (marriage) proposal confirmed? deti hai toh de warna gaand mara Guys can be creepy. They don't realize that they are being creepy, which is the pitiful and sad condition of India. Also, most healthy relationships root from friendship, so I don't get the concept of friendzone. Also, I have seen girls rejecting guys just for fun so they can be vicious.

I've also noticed lack of confidence in many guys. 

""What would you do if I proposed you?"", ""I love you""...on WhatsApp. I mean, am I supposed to take it seriously.

The best was when I received a plant with a note attached to it in person, because the guy noticed that I didn't like the fact how flowers just go to waste after gifting. It was something thoughtful and I really adored it. 

So yeah, it depends. (If you re planning to propose, it totally depends on person. I am not a fan of roses and all the cliche things but she/he might be. You need to know the person to actually like them, or is it just 'love at first sight'?) Mummy Ko bhej dete hai fruit ki basket de kar with a red chunni, a few dried dates and a proposal for rishta...

I'm assuming you know the other party before hand otherwise that will be creepy.

If you guys have been in a relationship with a decent courting period and you think that it's time to take your realtionship to the next level, ask your SO if she'd be interested to finally tie the knot.
If you get a yes, call at home and set up a meeting.

I have been reading on many websites and trying to find out the processes, terminology and what not - just to be stuck in reading but not doing anything.

Randian's who have managed to and/or doing it on there own, please put in your experiences and guides to do the needful.

I'd like to stress here that though the process is considered simpler now, it seems far too bureaucratic  for a IT simpleton like me. From what I have read and understood:

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

And then there is freelancing and creating your own product - for which what and what not's are not clear anywhere. because presumably you'd need trademark and stuff there too and you also need TAN and PAN and DIN and current accounts and etc.

What I am interested in creating my web based product, and deploying it and making money. problem is I don't know if it is actually that simple.

So I don't want to make it about myself. I'd like this to be for others too who might want to seek up similar help or who'd step on this path in future.

Please, help and post your knowledge and experiences.

Thanks!!! 🙏",cleanstart92," Pvt Ltd or LLP are indeed better than OPC, but if you're solo and don't want to involve anyone, it's better to go with OPC than a Proprietorship. In fact, unless you're taking outside investment or have more than one partner (i.e. yourself), I would even recommend to go for an OPC instead of a Pvt Ltd.

OPCs get treated like Pvt Ltds in all matters but don't have the same compliance burden. 

You're also overthinking this. Register a company (don't need dedicated office; just need address proof) first. Once that's done, talk to a CA about registering trademarks.

Also, this isn't shit you should be DIYing. Hire a CA. If you hope to be a founder, you'll have to delegate. Financial and compliance matters are not in your domain of expertise, so offload them to people who specialize in these things. Few of my inputs

1. **Don't incorporate a LLP or Company unless external reasons require you to do so.** They only add additional compliance expenses, closing them down is lengthy and expensive process and they provide no additional value. Forget what you read about limited liability you read online, this is India not USA.
2. **If you have to incorporate, create a LLP instead of OPC or Limited company.** Otherwise, if you end up making good money, it will be locked up in company account and a you can't withdraw without paying additional dividend tax. You can always convert a LLP to company if needed, but converting a company to LLP has lot of rules and waiting period.
3. **Hire a CA.** Don't do all legal stuff yourself.

&#x200B;

Finally, if you just want to make a web based product, do as proprietorship. Unless you start earning 5-10 lakhs a year, its useless to get involved in legal stuff.",AskIndia,2019-07-09 13:55:35

Hello all, right now I am working in manual testing ( basically game testing),I like programming but my logic is not that good, so I have decided to go for Automation testing.

Edit 1: for context - age 26F, BE computer science",seeseetwo," Yep. Manual testing is dead in most places.

Definitely practice coding and look for dev jobs as older (slower) companies still employ different teams for Dev and QA but the newer ones that practice DevOps don't. Not just manual testing, but QA/testing as a field is dying. We don't have separate devs/testers in most places nowadays.

Automation is actually a good step up if you want to get into programming. You can start from there and slowly build up. Meanwhile, you can keep preparing and practicing programming in your spare time. I can recommend a few online courses as well if you're really interested.

And hey, 'my logic is not strong' is not the way to go about this. Spend time, learn, and you'll do more than just fine. All the best. Automation is good field, but don't expect the testing to be a field that companies would be willing to spend on in the near future. Most of them are now hiring full stack engineers who should know to code end to end also are expected to test their own modules. Start working on your java skills, try python too it's easy to pick up if you already understand java. Get a bit onto coding daily, small programs and logic questions like in competitive programming should help you.

Also, Buy Dominar. Try Jawa. Waiting period is long though. I'll address all the recommendations in this thread with my opinion. I spent a lot of time researching bikes this year prior to my own purchase.

Duke 125/200 / MT15 - Do not have comfortable pillion seats. I had to throw them out of my head for that reason alone.

Dominar - Meets and maybe even exceeds expectation for the price, but is expensive.

FZ25 - A good machine overall, fits in your budget perfectly.

Apache RTR 200 - I own this. If your touring needs are that light, you'll find yourself more than satisfied. It's extremely fun (rev happy), has a comfortable pillion seat and a very satisfying power band. You'll save some money too.

FZv3/Hornet - They have significantly lower power numbers. The Hornet is also quite handsomely priced for what it is. They're not as *fun* to ride as the other motorcycles on this list, but are great for mileage and pillion comfort.

Get test rides and more importantly, **get dual channel ABS**. Have you considered the Dominar? Will require stretching your budget by 30k though. A tourer's dream.

But do test ride it regardless. And check if local service centers have good reviews. FZv3 or MT15 FZV3 or Honda Hornet. Exceeding the budget, could go for Dominar. Nothing apart from these three is even worth giving your time. Dominar, Apache 200 4v, Yamaha FZ 25, Gixxer, Gixxer SF Bajaj Avenger, do test ride it first.

1) IGDTU - ECE Electronics - I was expecting her to get this till round 3 but haven't till now, so a bit worried

2) NSUT - MPAE Manufacturing Process & Automation Engg - Very difficult to get considering last year cutoffs - may get only after Round 4

3) DTU - MAM Mechanical & Automotive Engg - May not get - high cutoff

4) NSUT - BT Biotechnology - Not a lucrative branch, but I have preferred it over other slightly better or similar branches of DTU because of lesser number of students (= better chance of getting placed)

5) IGDTU - MAE Mechanical & Automation Engg - Allotted

6) DTU - PIE Production & Industrial Engg - All of below branches are almost alike in placement scenario as all of them have very less/poor Core placement options. Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. 

7) DTU - Civil

8) DTU - EP Engg Physics

9) DTU - Polymer

10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg

11) DTU - BT Biotechnology

Of late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus. So I would totally prefer a better branch in place of better college but MAE is not an exceptional branch either. And she won't get IT in IGDTU either.

Q2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?

3) the shitty shitty whyphy, motherfucker i want to kill the salesman who said i would be getting 50-60 mbps, the speed that i get is even lower than their low speed data that should be around 1 mbps, fucker reminds me of the gprs/edge days which still might be faster because of low data requirement for the page  

4) the stupidest and tardiest customer service ever, first you have to wait a whoopass 20 fucking minutes on the phone listening to the fucking jio tone or whatever, if that doesn't fry your brains, then the customer service guy/gal will. they are the fucking most typical indian customer service guys you can imagine. For a moment I thought i was in the south park episode with customer support and the vr headset. If you have seen Kenny's and kanan's maa ki dal sketch, then this guy is even worse than kenny. the same guy is the customer support and the floor manager and the technical team and yet they don't know shit  

enough with rant, i had some question for my borthers who got baited  

 * if any jio gigafiber users have figured a workaround for the landline, do tell mate  
 * how is your wi-fi speed, please tell me it gets better  
 * and yes any data hoarder or torrent user, does gigafiber have port forwarding, i have made all firewall exceptions, enabled upnp and still not able to open a port  

edit: i mentioned port forwarding in the last line incorrectly, i wanted to know about upnp support on jio, cause  with most CGNAT enabled isps, asking for static ip's becomes costly, so i had been using upnp to seed which can be easily enabled on the modem webpage. previously i had been using airtel and they had this service, what is the case with jio?",darkknight42062," We haven't got Jio Gigafiber yet in our city. 

How much do you for it and what's the plan? I'm currently using local broadband service that provides 20 Mbps speed for unlimited data at annual price of Rs 5500 and I'm pretty satisfied with it. Been using it for 1.5 years and still haven't faced any major issue with the service. For the first point , it’s triple play so everything is done through the ONT. so no use trying to bad mouth them for the unique experience 

Second jio uses CGNAT so no port forwarding at all.you’ll need to buy static ip to do the same and no this is not unique .almost all Indian isps do the same . Rs 2500 ONT only has 2.4 GHz wifi so speed will be slow.",AskIndia,2019-06-10 11:14:44

Turn them off, for example Cortana and Opt In Ads. Also uninstall extra software that ASUS installs by default (a quick Google search will help you see which ones are useful and which ones aren't). Update the PC fairly regularly and use windows defender to scan for malware once in 2 weeks. Download ublock origin, privacy badger and https everywhere from the firefox/chrome store, depending on the browser you use. 

Win 10 Home is fine. If you're getting pro for free might as well as get that since you're getting additional features (which you will most likely never use) for free, but if you have to pay then don't. Install TripMode (get it from TripMode.ch) - it's not free but cheap. Using TripMode you can easily control what programs are allowed to connect to the internet. This can be a huge blessing with Windows 10 that will keep trying to upload all your personal data to Microsoft and / or try to download huge updates. You can simply block all this and run windows update when you want to.

Don't install Chrome as it will just slow down your system - it's a personal data, memory and processor hog. Instead use Firefox or PaleMoon with uBlock Origin extension for blocking ads along with Privacy Badger and DecentralEyes extension.

Yes, install Linux. I recommend [LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition)](https://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php) instead of Ubuntu which also slows down systems now a days. Use it the best way you can. Don't worry about OS until it bothers you to a point you need to consider alternatives. Only thing I'd suggest you do is monitor the battery life. Playing games, watching videos will drain your batter faster than, say, browsing reddit or editing text files. Once you settle into a routine, monitor how long your battery lasts. Keep it clean.

- Allegations are true. Priya not guilty, though nothing happens to MJ.

While I expect most people to complain about merit or whatever. I'm wondering about people who can think past that. Yes, it will mean women will be set up as puppet candidates, but then men are set up as puppet candidates all the time. So we arent losing on anything.

What is this major problem? Equal opportunity doesn’t mean equal outcome. You can create reservations for women in politics but it doesn’t necessarily mean that more women will be inclined to join politics. All you can do is create awareness and leave the choice to them. Why just stop there? Reserve 70-80% seats for backward castes because that's their true population proportion. I don't know how i feel about reservations in general. But if we do implement reservation then why not make it proportional to the actual ratio of men and women? Even if this happens, most seats will be won by women who will be the puppets of their husbands/family, aka Ravri Devi. There needs to be good governance set in place, the probability of an independent woman making it to the top is very less in India unless she's already having a career in politics, which most seats won't have. Let’s also reserve seats based on religion, caste, height, weight, skin tone and length of penis. /s",AskIndia,2019-06-17 14:03:00

Please share your experience.


Edit: This post is just sad as hell.",OnidaKYGel," I lost my father exactly 1 year ago yesterday. Although he was a diabetic but there was never a complication. Then suddenly he suffered a heart stroke and that was it. I unfortunately wasn’t with him in his last moments. 

I had always practiced this event in my mind that one day he won’t be there. But when you hear this news you don’t seem to comprehend it. Nothing makes sense to you at all. All the plans you had made are now gone. You had planned for a surprise family holiday? It’s gone. You wanted to discuss some random stuff with him? Not possible. You wanted to buy him a new tool kit? Not possible. 

The initial 2-3 months are the worst while your mind rewrites or reroutes your thoughts to navigate around the void that’s  just been created. Your keep asking yourself what if you had done that or what if you were there etc .

And then gradually time heals everything and you learn to live with his memories. Life goes on. I lost my mom before my 10th grade exams and my dad 3 months ago.... I'm currently writing my final sem exams. It sucks big time especially when you're not expecting someone to just go away suddenly - the case with my dad. 


Both my mom and dad had chronic illnesses, I don't even wanna name what the illnesses were coz they were so bad I wish nobody has to go through what they went through. Hospital and medical expenditure was so high that we couldn't save a penny and as result, right now, my final condition is very pathetic and I have two sisters to take care of. We still don't have our own house we still live in a rented house in 2019, we have no property, no land, nothing. Most of our relatives are scums, they never supported my dad when he was ill and we don't expect anything from them so we like to maintain our distance.


Mentally speaking, I'm depressed, hopeless, shattered. I still am not over my Dad's death. He would have lived had he agreed to go to the hospital earlier so there will always be this guilt with me, I'll always feel like I couldn't save my dad and I have to live with it.


 Speaking of the future, I just don't know what to do now from here. Nothing's going the right way for me. My dream is to crack UPSC civil services exam but UPSC will take time and i don't have time, i have to find a job quick asap after my exams so I'll probably do some odd jobs and give some easier government exams for now and then I'll see what I can do. 


It's like I don't have a purpose for living anymore but I'm trying. Trust me, nothing is worse than losing both your parents. Please spend everyday with your parents like it would be their last so you don't have any regrets like me. Life is cruel and you cannot predict what's going to happen next. Lost my Dad in 2016. I've never been truly happy since then. I always get stressed or mad at even the most silliest thing and it's genuinely ruining my life. Haven't yet managed to think that he's truly gone. :( Depends on what age you lose them, what kind of relation you had, and your own nature.

When you get older and lose them, you get over it faster.  If they were suffering from a major illness, you will be relieved that they are gone.

Miley is awesome! (The character in this show, not the actual Miley Cyrus)

She's so much fun, blunt, to the point, very expressive and animated, so cute!

  


And best part is, unlike other Disney Princesses, she is so much real; She keeps getting into trouble, tries to balance her double life, has her own little struggles, and doesn't get saved by a prince. ;-)

  


And she is also very clever, smart, funny, witty, and, best of all, silly.

  


Her dad and brother are quite nice characters. They are so relatable. I love their Tennessee accent. The dad makes dad jokes all the time. So dope.

  


It's her friend Lilly who annoys me. But she is Miley's friend. So our friend too!

  


But how will it be a Disney show if it doesn't take us to a fancy fantasy land!? This show doesn't fail us there either. She is just another teenage kid, who lives the life of superstar once she puts on the wig!!! Which teenager can't fantasy such a life!?

  


And like a fable, they convey some nice messages! Such as ""if you get down with dogs, you'll end up with fleas. 😂""

Advice on next steps!,219,awhwhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/awhwhv/askindia_i_found_out_that_my_wife_is_cheating/,128,"Hello /r/india I don't visit this frequently and rarely posted or commented here. I run a small engineering firm and make more then enough to live a happy, comfortable and also few luxuries. Worked very hard to be where I am.

So I found out that my wife is cheating. I am 39 and she is 33 and we have two kids, a girl and a boy. I am very upset. The marriage is broken irreparably. I want out.

I have an appointment with lawyer next monday to discuss this over. The wait of next two days sees unbearably long. 

Knowing my wife, I know it's going to be a big drama which I want to avoid at all costs. I just want to put evidence of her activities before her and part our ways silently. What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? I will also hire a PI the first thing the next week.

I'd like to have full custody of our children. Does anyone know under what conditions will I be able to get that?

EDIT:

Thanks for all your responses. Few were helpful, few disturbing and few others distasteful. Anyway, I am just normal at home as if nothing happened. I have a strictly predictably routine and I intend to keep it that way. I am off to drop my daughter at her friend's place who is celebrating her birthday today.

I am very methodical and I'll deal with this issue just like that. I am going to write down everything I plan to do, rehearse it multiple times with my lawyer (he responded), plug holes and build a solid case.

There are many suggesting that I don't monitor her activities as it's illegal. I can appreciate that. But I am anyway going to do it. What's important to me primarily is the evidence, the truth and the full picture. What I do with it is totally a different matter altogether. I may not tell her, I may just poke and see the response, I may not not use the evidence for legal proceedings (and that's up to lawyer anyway) or I may just burn it all. The world doesn't need to know I employed an investigator to collect evidence, legal or not.",ThisSuggestedName," [deleted] Hey, I am fighting a domestic violence case filed against me by my wife. There are a few things I want to share.            

First things first. Custody mostly goes to mothers and the fathers get visitation rights on weekends, festivals etc. The legal system in India is highly biased in favor of women. Not to discourage you, but adultery in India is very difficult to prove. In one case, a man produced pictures of his wife in compromised positions with another man, and in turn his wife filed a new case of outraging her modesty. It is not impossible, but difficult.       
      
Now, main issue: money. Everything will come down to money. How much are you willing to give to her so that she says yes for a divorce. They call it settlement, which in easy words is extortion. Everybody in the system, right from clerk to judge will ask you to settle. Lumpsum money or else monthly maintenance for her. If you file a divorce, chances are you will get a 498A, DV, 125 package in return.      
      
This are some of the problems, now some solutions. Main: gather all the evidences that you can, each & everything, document everything and she shouldn't know about it. Gather her job records & salary slips (if she is working) and education records (if she isn't working). List down all your assets and liabilities. Document stuff that shows she has been a careless mother.      
      
If you are able to prove adultery beyond a reasonable doubt, you have cracked it. SC said that a wife committing adultery is not entitled to get any maintenance or other monetary benefits.        
      
Most importantly, keep a cool head. Don't lose heart. Happens with many of us and you are not the only one who is wronged. Be motivated and never lose your focus on your job/work. Your value is just because of your job/work.  Document everything. Meticulously. Chat msgs from years back, your paper documents, the money you both spent, everything. As detailed as you can. You never know what can come useful. Don't confront until you have solid evidence.

Custody is something that usually isn't affected by adultery. As in you aren't going to get full custody simply because of the fact that your wife cheated. Economics and stable environment are the key factors there.

The simplest way to get access to FB or phone lock is to stand behind the person when they're unlocking and sneak a look. Then ask to make a call or something and use it. There's no magic hacking apps or something like that so try not to download a virus in the enthusiasm.

Stay calm, go take a walk or a long shower. As in chess, when you're position is disadvantaged, it's time to slow down, consolidate your position and think about the next move carefully. Not throw the game in anger. Good luck and keep us posted OP. [removed] I’d recommend you in any emergency case of a 498A/125DV, connect to Shonee Kapoor. This guy literally nailed his own case with a victory (Adultery and post that False 498A. Court had quashed his case and he didn’t have to give any kind of maintenance)

Hope you are fine brother. Please collect as much evidence as you can. Phone call recordings, pictures, chats, SMSes, every goddamn thing you have against her.

Very high probability that the opposition lawyer will suggest your wife to file all those 498A 125DV bullshit charges for sure so that they could harass you more.

Hell, these things literally deter me from getting married in the future. [removed] women tend to have an upper hand in these situations my question is the person married or not? Sorry to hear that buddy. I can only wish you good luck... and offer you a beer. Keep your chin up. Take a paternity test. Sincerely Dude consult a family lawyer he would be able to give you far better advice than any user out here. Marriage and divorce are huge thing in India so there is no escaping the family drama. Lesson learnt. Never gonna get married
 First up, remove the personal details you have supplied in the first post. Can easily be passed on to your spouse if somebody connected + adept at reddit goes through it. 1) Adultery is grounds for divorce.

2) Regarding custody. It is generally true that it is awarded to the mother. However, in this case her behaviour would be a strong consideration to award it to you.

Disclaimer: nothing in this comment should be construed as legal advice. Please contact a lawyer. From now on you may want to screenshot all chats with her and also record phone conversations.  > What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? 

Do not go down this path. You'll come out worse off than before.  How did you find out ?  Is the evidence fool proof?

Who is the guy she is cheating with? Hey, I'm a little late to the thread, but I thought I'd chime in, a bit, being a lawyer. 

You're being remarkably level-headed about this, which  is a huge plus. that being said, I understand your motivation to gather evidence, but make sure you do nothing illegal. You don't want to have a criminal case against you, and, as others have said, our judicial system is quite biased towards women. A competent lawyer could easily allege stalking, outraging the modesty of a woman, indecency, etc. 

Another thing is to make sure you go to the right lawyer. You mentioned you're going to the best lawyer in the city. Make sure he/she also practices in the district courts, where your case will be filed. The best lawyers usually tend to practice in High Courts and the Supreme Court, and lose touch with trial court practice. 

If you have anything you need to ask, feel free to message me. I hope everything works out for you. Hit the lawyer, Delete Gym, Facebook Up. If you have multiple devices lying around like an extra tablet, iPad and by any chance if she's logged into FB on those device/s you could use that to read her FB chat logs and take screenshots. 
Don't confront her without evidence plan with your lawyer. 
I have no experience but I have read and seen movies and I'm speaking from those stories.  Pretty sure you are taking the right decision. Get off that cheating piece of shit. erm, pretty sure it's illegal to monitor her email/phone i will not recconmend you to do any spying on her phone but ....but you can use some simple technique to unlock her phone when she is not there ..and also fb or whatsapp massage willnot b a better evidence as u need hard evidence a video or photograph ...maybe install a webcam  Look dude i don't have any idea about this stuff but most of the people here are saying to gather enough evidence so i will suggest try to hire a private investigator who will help you with that stuff, also contact your lawyer about this. If you don't have any evidence, then play it cool. Or else, she will figure out something is up, and guess you know. In which case, she might file fake domestic violence charges against you to make your future claims look unreliable. Also, I would recommend you delete this post too. Just in case she or her lover frequents this sub. firstly freeze your bank accounts and other valuables so that wife does not have access...then collect as many evidences as possible video and audio recordings work best..after all this confront your wife and ask your divorce..tell her that you have strong evidences if she resists Hey OP, firstly I’m really sorry to know you’re in such a situation. It sucks. However you seem to have a level headed plan for the future. Don’t listen to folks who are suggesting you to stay married just for the sake of kids/ family blah blah blah. Cheating is a dealbreaker and nothing can amend that.

The toughest part is the legal battle ahead of you and you making sure that you don’t end up with a bad deal by the court. Therefore, don’t confront. Gather evidence. Pretend to act normal until you have it all and are confident that your case is strong. Only then proceed with filing a case etc. 

Best of luck OP. More power to you.  Whether you want a divorce or not is entirely your decision. Don't listen to any of the toxic advice on here regarding that. 

The best thing you can do now is think of her purely as the mother of your children and not your wife. Try and be as mature as you possibly can for the sake of your children. 

Asking for full custody of your children (hence depriving them of a mother) because she cheated on you is unfair on you, her and MOST importantly your children. It will also make you look vengeful and petty. More than that it will really affect your relationship with your kids in the future. Her cheating on you is no indication of her being a bad mother. 

Lastly, for god's sake DO NOT try to track her communication, stalk her or snoop around. As you know it's illegal and if the court/she find out, it will make you look really, really bad. You say you are not planning to do that to gather evidence for the court. Why else are you doing this then? How on earth will doing this help you deal with the situation? You say she is dramatic but if you do this then you are fighting fire with fire. 

Go to a good lawyer and listen to them. Reddit is not the place to get advice for this stuff. This place is full of immature teens and young adults who have no idea what you are going through and they've probably never been in a relationship before. They are (self-admittedly) giving you advice based on movies!! You don't need this right now. Go to a lawyer and stop listening to reddit. 

I'm sorry for what you are going through. I hope you are able to deal with this well and be there for your children. This is going to be really difficult for them so try and make it as easy as possible for them. Don't make them choose between you and her, they need both parents. Good luck OP :) Fucking hoes man. And the damage is almost unrepairable. 
Been so long,  I still can't trust anyone. 
Good luck mate. How old are your kids? It's very difficult for the father to get custody of his teenage children. You should take advice from the PI only regarding snooping her. Is that even legal? And why don't you confront her, it will be messy but might really prevent some miscommunication on your part. You can't monitor her phone and social media, that's illegal.  Don't break the law as part of collecting evidence any sensible lawyer she hires will have that shit thrown out and hurt your case irreparably. I'd say it's lucky that she doesn't know you know, keep it that way and follow the advice of your lawyer. Hello OP, sorry to read about the pain you are experiencing. I know that extra marital affairs have become extremely common in India and most people including the cheating spouse are not aware of the problems and pains it causes, which can be extreme. Many people have given you advice in this thread so I won't try to offer you that, but I request something from you. From reading your replies it is clear that you have experienced a great psychological trauma. I want you to please share your thoughts and feelings about this major incident of your life. What went through your mind, did you feel disgusted, insulted, outraged, what kind of topics did you think a lot upon, etc. I think this will help many people who are reading this thread and it may also help you release some built-up pressure by explaining in detail your pain and suffering. I'll be very obliged. a. In cases of adultery, the married one most of the times isn't willing to give up the marriage for the lover's sake. The lover is dropped like a hot potato when the marriage is at stake. If you are open for reconciliation, you can go through therapy to fix things. Obviously it's hard to place faith in someone involved in infidelity. But it's your choice. You have kids. If you don't want your kids to grow up without their mother, you can consider this option.

b. Technical info like call logs, location history etc. is tracked by Google Activity by default unless turned off. But you need access to her gmail id to avail that. It could be add on to whatever you gather from PI. 

Wish you the courage and strength to face this difficult times.  [deleted] Welcome to the club. Enjoy your future days !!! [deleted] When you finally decide to talk this over make sure you are ready with all sorts of trail and evidence. Ok I know you’re upset and you have every right to be, but you’re asking for full custody because she cheated? You’re going to take your anger which you justifiably have towards your wife on your children by depriving them of their mother. I’m not sure how the law works where you are but where I am, emails and all that begotten without consent of the other person do not count in a court of law. Hire a PI. And also, do what’s best for your kids. She may be a shit wife but she has a right also to her children.  This is not the right forum. Consult, r/relationships, r/relationship_advice, specifically mention that you are in India. Hi, its upsetting to read this, but from my experience of being standing and seeings a frnds irreparable marriage.. i would like to suggest something.. is it the first instance this this is happening? I mean had your alwaays marriage been in problems? How did this all start..? The the distance between 2 of you increasing after any particular event? What i want to say is the the cheating only reason? Had she never loved you? The cheating is more of a need for love or togetherness or just cheating? Also one more thing.. has your daily life with her gone worse.. like daily fights or and things? Or u just act cool and she does too? Just pretend we all are cool and lovely?

 I may sound wrong.. but we all know when things start to go wrong, the distance between people starts increasing.. if you really love her.. and you can find a human reason for what she is doing can that can be repaired.. i would suggest you take a higher stand than her.. i know its hard. But at the end you would know u are better, u gave her chance.. maybe there might be some mistakes u must have made on the way, that she wanted to distance from you.. and find love somewhere else . But you know we are humans, and we need love .
The only thing i would to suggest you is if feel this is not cause of the distance that had been growing since time . U keep gathering your evidence.. and keep it safe.. look it at a perspective of why would she do that.. find a reason in those evidences and history u have together.. sometimes people drift away in search of love... I donno who to blame in these cases.. but as a person with understanding the human nature can we give try to give human instinct some chance? I think we can... 

From my experience.. i would suggest u gather evidences, with mere goal of knowing whats wrong( if this looks more like cheating than just a person trying to go away)..u will know if its  a sexual escapade or a find for love.. u will be able to see those in chats or anything.. while at it, i would suggest u try to talk to her.. not openly.. maybe ask her whats wrong why has your relationship detoriated over time(if it has) maybe she wont open up.. it will take time.. make sure you u dont sound like u are accusing her of cheating... Coz  that thing is going to make her feel guilty as hell and she wont let u know anything further..

If your goal is to just leave her.. then dont think about what i have said above.. but is you plan it know things and what has gone wrong, coz all this pain you and u cant bliv this has happened.. u can try to talk and know whats wrong.. no need to present evidences.. maybe she comes back if she starts to realise the distance has increased and she has done a grave mistake.. 

All d best OP. We humans are the capable of mistake as well as forgiveness.. dont forget this dont need to continue.. u may have already tried all those things i have said above.. maybe u are at the brink on ""no way out"".. so i can understand.. u need to have ur freedom too.. ur peace of mind too.. have a great day OP. [deleted] I can give you the exact value of PI. Don't monitor her personal stuff. It doesn't look good on your part.

Questions you need answer to yourself.  how is she as a mother? Would the kids be okay with you getting sole custody? It seems like you have not confronted with her yet. May be you have not been available much to her. She is human after all. This is perfectly repairable, you need to be more understanding and accepting. Don't take this step. Ignore other guys advising about divorce, collecting proof etc. It depends :

1. Try to hint to her and warn. See if it can improve the situation.

2. If you really love her or she loves you, there is still hope.

3. If you believe in virginity and all those stuff.

4. By all means try to fix it and live with her. Else life of kids will be a mess. If mother has affair that can hurt kids badly (if father has affair, not that much).

Think well and decide. 
All the best.  Man. Try to amend this relationship. You are breaking your home.

You are looking into years of litigation, including dowry, maintainance, child custody, and possibly defamation/rape/more if your wife is clever. Your whole life will become a mess. Children divided.

Do yourself a favor. Don't get involved in this mess. I am facing such mess and it's not worth it.

Give her one last warning. And discuss the problems frankly with her. Maybe you are not giving her enough time. She is a human after all.",AskIndia,2019-03-02 21:45:42
"[AskIndia] How would you like an app-based, healthy tiffin service?",103,b2vyxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b2vyxr/askindia_how_would_you_like_an_appbased_healthy/,79,"The amazing people of this sub, I need your thoughts and suggestions! I'm interested in making a small app that,

- offers tiffin service with actual healthy food

- caters most items, from gym diet to regular parathas

- has cancellations with refunds

How do you feel about such a service? Will you be willing to pay a little extra for it? (Assuming you like the food and everything!) Will you personally try it? Or do you think it's dumb? 

Also, here's a small anonymous  [10 question survey] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScW9VaIbANplEGv8S6mRDfZbi0CuX1win6wqD_aB4TDE9y_vg/viewform) just in case you have a minute to spare!
",thecodersblock," Eat fit is already doing it. Stealing your idea. Cya later I think it would be a good idea. There used to be a few services like this in Bangalore (redcooker or something along those lines). 

Why not go for a model like Blue Apron in the US, wherein the user subscribes for pre portioned ingredients with recipes in a way that's user friendly for beginners to make? I love to cook and experiment, but the daily grind ensures that 90% of the time I end up eating out or ordering takeaways.  Sounds like a good idea to me. I'd definitely use it and would be willing to pay a little extra, just don't make a fool of customers with exorbitant airport like prices for tiny portions. Absolute hygiene is my number 1 priority. Glove, cap and sterilize the shit out of everything possible. And dont just say it.Give us proof. Get external agenices to audit the hygiene(if such agencies exist) and also post thorough Hygiene standards and rules so that we can hold you accountable. Put uo youtube videos of kitchen tours. Ok now lets come to nutriton. Obviously do your research and make everything healthy but also add an Organic tier. The Organic variety should have the main things like chcken and milk sourced orgamically, i.e., without pesticides or hormones etc. And lastly money. You guys need to make the least possible profit that fits your model or else this system fails. And Also reach out to cities where similar services dont exist yet(cover all the metros to begin with). Thats about it :) Honestly I guess you guys are already done with all the planning and investing phase and are going to launch soon so whats done is done, but still one can hope, can he not Done. FYI there is an app on Google play store called ""Fofi"" which does the same. Restricted to Chennai though. Like Tinmen?  Where is your would be startup based?  How is this different from eat. fit or half a dozen 'health food' restaurants listed on swiggy right now?

I was witness to the great ""food tech"" boom of 2014, couple of which promised calorie counted, nutrition counted, healthy meals. None of them survived. Why not become an aggregator for homechefs? There are quite a few home run catering services and mom's who cook everyday for their family, if they have an extra meal which might be wasted or forcefully eaten, you can use it and just need to take care of packaging and delivery. Homemade meal averages out to Rs 30 per meal (3 rotis, daal and one veg), you can buy it for 50 and then sell it with packaging and delivery for a nominal profit and at the same time get mom's in to the gig economy.  All the best, OP. Check out [Food darzee](https://www.fooddarzee.com/) if you haven't already. They pretty much do the same. A suggestion: Give detailed nutritional detail for each meal plan, to be viewed upon button click or something. And maintain the quality and taste of food while meeting the nutritional detail exactly.  Box8 also did this, cooking food and delivering it, but I doubt they couldn't run this long. Also, any type of delivery business is the worst idea.

Edit - in Mumbai, some restaurant also does it on personal portal like hellogreen.in Eat.fit-Cult is already there I am a budget user. If i get healthy meals at 50 - 70. I will be more than happy. 

* Curefit is very costly. Suppose each meal cost around 150. So for 25 days it comes around as 3750. Which is 25% of 15000 rupees.
* 15000 rupees is standard salary of freshers, BPO people who are in large numbers. So curefir meals constitute 25% of salary,
* If you bring the cost to 1/3 rd  of 3750 i.e 1250 will be glad to buy it. definitely an untapped and good idea in india! try to include more of local stuff unlike ichef. also follow try following blue apron's business model as something on the side for cheaper prices. i definitely see potential in mumbai.  actually sounds like a good idea.  Definitely sounds like a good idea for big cities. Cult fitness in bangalore already does it and it looks popular- at least from zomato reviews.

My only request would be eco friendly/bio-degradable packaging, if you are moving forward with the idea.  another one? I used one app, TinMen which does exactly this. Check the food subscriptions here in US, you may be inspired. Subscriptions here send portioned out meal kits to make your own food, this works because you don't need to do any shopping or measure quantities. There's a spice only subscription too. You mean [eat.fit](https://eat.fit) version 2.0 ? Gym diet please! I can't make chicken at home will eat outside if there's a tiffin app  The market is already saturated with similar services. Since you are entering a crowded space, your customer acquisition costs for the first 2 years are going to be very high.

Inspite of all the odds , the Indian consumer is moving towards healthy and organic food and there is still a huge market for it, if your able to offer something unique to consumers, you will succeed. I personally would love a good app based tiffin service, I have tried some, but the food becomes too routine after some time and doesn't feel worth the exlenditure anymore. So my suggestion would be to try and make the menu have some surprise elements, so that every meal feels different. Also, I don't know if it's logistically possible, but customizable amount of spices would be a great feature for a tiffin service. That said, all the best OP. I'm going to ask you the same questions I anyone when they talk about their idea.

* The product (what is it, use case, who would want it)
* The market (TAM, size, competition, dynamics to be aware of)
* Product analysis / comparison against competition
* What stage are you in? Do you need money? Are you raising?
* Customer conversion strategy (where do you find them, and how do you make them buy  from you?)
* Why you? Why are YOU the best person for this job? (experience? good team? rich daddy who can't bring himself to pull the plug? what?)
* Have you thought differently about this idea differently? what are you offering that's different from others in the same market? Better business plan would be to import Huel.com from UK and sell it in India on Amazon. Like Swiggy?",AskIndia,2019-03-19 18:55:44
"[AskIndia] What brands of personal grooming (shampoo, soaps, face wash etc) are actually of a good quality and you refuse to cheap out on?",127,aoo0i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aoo0i0/askindia_what_brands_of_personal_grooming_shampoo/,155,I feel like most budget brands are very harsh and do more harm than good. ,gymshoos," Thank you OP for this thread. Lot's of useful info
 Stop using head and shoulders. Go sulfate free. Use conditioner, everytime you shampoo. Shampoo 3 times a week or less. Stop taking ice cold showers, take hot shower to open up pores and exfoliate, then go cold to close up your pores, moisturize your skin when you get out after you dry off. Drink more water. Wash your face every day and moisturize after. 

Stop using head and shoulders, it is too alkaline for your skin and the fact is you probably dont have dandruff. Flakes is not dandruff. 

Hair styling products (salons sell) will not make your hair fall out. Hot water will not make your hair fall out. I dont care what your friend said they are wrong. Turmeric will not make your hair grow more. Henna is bad, I know it's natural, I know your people have used it for 1000s of years. It is bad for your hair. 

Pomade is your friend, dont be afraid.

-sincerly your friendly American stylist who works with tons of Indian tech guys. Forest Essentials. Olay facewash, a light yellow colored packet, beats others to the dust in terms of skin friendliness and its impact. 

Garnier and such brands are so heavy on the skin. Vicco Turmeric, nahi cosmetic. Vicco turmeric cosmetic cream! Half the products mentioned here, I had never heard the brand names before now !  
I didn't know such things existed !!  
What science, what technology!!!  
Is this India? Face wash - Avene Cleanance Gel. Costs a bomb but the quantity is huge and value for money.

Moisturiser - ~~Avene~~ Aveeno moisturising lotion. It moisturises really well without making the skin feel oily or greasy.

Shampoo - I usually keep changing them after a few months. Started using St. Botanica recently. Too early to give an opinion.

Soap - I use Biotique Almond Oil soap(for lazy days) and keep trying different body washes. Current one is from Palmolive. I like it because it has a scrubby texture. CeraVe was nice but global shipping on Amazon takes time now I just use Cetaphil.  I have long curly hair so most shampoos make my hair super dry and brittle. I switched to biotique sulphate free shampoo and it has made a huge difference but I dont think biotique is like an expensive brand. 

If you feel something is harsh try to read the ingredients list and pick shampoos and soaps that are milder. I cheap out on a lot of stuff especially make up but the only thing I feel I have to spend money on for quality is perfume.  Life Buoy and Dettol products for asli mard. Patanjali if you want skin cancer. Medimix. The hard green one. Lush. Body Shop.  I'm almost 17 and I use johnsons baby shampoo and my hair is good [deleted] Fabindia Daily Use Shampoo fiama ke bath soap and gel...

especially wo purple wala. All I use is soap. I don't care what soap it is. Usually something normal like Lux, Mysore Sandal,etc. I stopped using everything else. Was addicted to Ponds body lotion for the last 10 years and have been addicted to steaming hot water baths all my life. So I started cold water showers.  I stopped using shampoos and conditioner as well. /r/NoPoo. Also was using hair products like smoothing serum n all of that. I have long hair that goes down to over half of my back.

All of it was starting to become a bit too much really. I used to face a lot of inconvenience while traveling. Cant have a bath if there's no hot water or shampoo/conditioner or body lotion. A lot of maintenance and effort and as a guy i felt i don't have to deal with all of this bullshit. I don't have the time and got more important things to deal with. And life is so much fucking better and simpler now. Now as long as I have just the bare essentials which I need(bath soap, toothbrush, toothpaste and a tongue scraper), im good to go anywhere :) Gaumutra Proraso for all shaving needs. A customer for 9+ years and their products are top tier. Facewash: Bioderma Sebium (Gel)

(I don't have any other options really, since most make me break out while this is has worked amazingly well for me).

Shampoo: L'Oreal Mythic Oil shampoo & Mask

Moisturizer: Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer

(It's a sunscreen too and zero breakouts).

Soap: Prefer a body wash: Neutrogena Rainbath shower gel.

These are non negotiable for me. My shaving cream on the other hand..... Lol....  Shampoo - If you can afford it for regular use Kerastase Densifique is really really good to control hairfall. I have been using it regularly for a year now and results are amazing. Not for dandruff control though. Use something else for that, along with Kerastase Face : Cetaphil cleanser, cerave moisturizer

Hair care : shea moisture shampoo, wow coconut oil conditioner. 

Body : loccitane shea butter soap (this is maybe the best thing I have found in recent years), cerave moisturizer again. 

Shaving : trigodon shaving soap, nivea sensitive after shave balm (this stuff is good)

hair styling : lockhart's goon grease pomade 

Fragrance : a few EDPs from Swiss Arabian (very high quality for the price, especially if you live in uae )

Everything listed here can be bought off of Amazon.in Cetaphil light moisturiser, palmers night cream. Anything non comedogenic is good. Stopped using manufactured bullshit a while back. For shampoo, buy amla, reetha, shikakai, boil it together, if you wanna store, freeze it. Lovely simple stuff for hair.
As an alternative to soaps, face wash, get multani mitti, gulaab jal, dahi, milk, i have a rose powder don't know what it's called, basically take different things, figure out what works well for your skin, mix & match & make ubtan out of it. Tum bhi saaf, Nahane ke baad wala paani bhi saaf.
It's not cheaping out, there really isn't anything in the market I think is good enough. I don't use it because I don't know all the shit they put in it.  Mysore Sandal Soap, Himalaya face wash, Biotique soya shampoo. Anything Nivea. I swear by it. Shaving foam, shampoo, face wash, moisturise r, everything. It's just good. And also not exorbitantly expensive. 

I Just don't find nivea soap that easily,  **Nivea Men's Oil Control Face Wash** - 
It's not really expensive but is a must if you have oily face. Also I love the cool menthol feeling

**Alfred Sung Cologne** -

This scent combines the freshness of basil with the earthy tone of sage. Juniper berries and caraway add a sweet, floral essence to the masculine scent, and its pepper note adds a hint of spiciness. Just one or two sprays will leave you smelling clean and feeling fresh throughout the morning and afternoon.


 search for paul Mitchell on Amazon  I prefer Biotique BioApricot.  Great Body Wash.

&#x200B;

I used Body Shop for a long time. But Biotique is by far the most luxurious and cost effective thing.  Use fiama or nivea men shower gel, i like them both [deleted] If you are with a beard, try Cinthol beard and face wash, beard oil and wax.
They are not cheap. But they are very cheap in comparison to the competition. Coconut virgin oil from Amazon instead of the regular parachute. Costs double but my hair love it. Idk what it is with parachute oil but it sucks. Nothing, it is all bollocks, I use bar soap and coconut oil. Himalaya Neem face wash and Nykaa Rosehip Oil for moisturiser  I would recommend Mysore sandal soap. It has the highest TFM 80%. Medimix soap. The BodyShop, Clinique

&#x200B;

Edit: About two months back switched to Skinkraft's range of customized face care products(cleanser, moisturizer and night cream). I am not using them daily as recommended, but have noticed a difference in appearance, mainly, more clear skin and fading of some dark spots. The main compliment I can give them is that there products do not cause any irritation.  Nivea all the way.
Body wash,
Face creme,
Moisturizer,
Chapstick,
Face wash,
Cleansing milk.

That's my nivea routine Soap - Life boy and Dettol. Despite all the shit about scented and what not by the competition, there's one thing you must remember. You live in India. Everything smells, you need as much anti-bacterial stuff as humanly possible to remain alive. So ditched the scented stuff and stick to Life Bouy and Dettol # Patanjali Forever My favorite soap is Cuticura. Rest I am yet to find something that I can stick to. Currently using Brylcreem Shampoo and Bombay Shaving Company face wash. Both are fine.  Old Spice. The body wash and underarm sticks from the US, cream and aftershave from here. 
 Anyone follows this YouTube channel Fit Tuber. He made a series about all these products based on ingredients. His claims are scientific but I'm not able to confirm them. Does anyone know how valid his claims are? Neutrogena facewash Cetaphil is an amazing face cleanser. It's worth a buy. 
For body products the body shop is one of the best brands you can buy. 
And , Boutique is another. The difference being, boutique is relatively cheap.  Kama ayurveda is good  Was recommended by a friend - small-ish company based in Pune called Vaidyam Healthcare. 

I have been using their hair oil. It did make a lot of difference. All their products are chemical free, so that's something. they have listed out all the ingredients they've used. It's good to know when a company is honest. Also I have started using their body butter as well. Good stuff, reduced my acne as well. Don't need any other creams/ moisturizers anymore. 

Face wash - Clean and Clear

Shampoo - Pure Elements, Rosemary Lemon Khadi.  Aha Glow for face wash, just awesome... Patanjali You should checkout fittuber [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw)

Sad but bitter truth. *""Shaadi karle....""* In konkani.

""Kaale?awoichi hadaa soduun asai?""

""What? searching for your mom's bones/skeleton?""

Seeing it translated, sounds really creepy. But it's basically an expression for looking for something. Or if you are lost ij thought.

Don't know the origin though. Or why anyone ever came up with such an expression. Tujhe bahar padhne bhejke galti kar di Looking at me and Dad - it's like I'm raising two kids in this house!!!!  When you leave for college, I'll rent a room near your hostel so I can cook food for you.

This isn't said in some nice wholesome way, it's a threat, haha. Jo karna hai wo karo (Do whatever you want to do)
It's a definite NO wrapped under the thick layer of sarcasm ""Rukja chimta garam karke laa rahi hu agar badmaashi band nahi kari to"" 'Jo bi hota hai ache ke liye hota hai' 

Also less common

'Paise ki tension na lia kar' (I'm a masters student in USA, so money issues)
'har time sab khush ni hote' (She means that it's life you can't be happy all the time)

She's pretty wise, she's a Hindi teacher for ~40 years. “Chhaan”

Marathi for ‘great.” She uses it when i’m in a bad situation

“Aai bill bgarayla visarlo” (Mom I forgot to pay the bill)

“Chaan” #""FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE EAT YOUR BREAKFAST BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE HOW DIFFICULT CAN IT BE!?!""  ""TAANGAAN TODHKE HAATH MEY DEDUNGI!!!""

...yup Hyderabadi here... “Pata tha!” Uthh jaao, ab kitna soyega. Siyapa mukke tere is phone laptap da Teri aukat he nahi hai! 😢 ""Pankha bandh kar"" So jaa, warna Hastar aa jayega .. Not used now but she used to say this while wake me up for school ""Utho laal ab aankhe kholo, paani layi hun muh dholo""  Kyun ka koi jawab nahi hota You don't listen to anything I say.. Utho utho, muh haath dho, brush karo, padhne baitho

I heard this everyday when I was in school. Now I'm 30 and this phrase still haunts me. Sar par haath rakh ke kha meri kasam ""Achaaaaaaaaaa"" tari vastu thekana par rakh 

which translates to keep your stuff in the right place.  Pata nahi kya paap kiya tha jo ye mila *""Beta jab main mar jaungi na, toh yaad karoge.""*

Thats when I get all stiff and shy when she approaches to hug/pat/kiss me.  >In Kannada: 'Naale andre haale'

From the last year's cutoff, She can get -
Civil, Engineering Physics, Production engg, at DTU. Not so much at NSUT except BioTech. Good NITs are really tough to get, being from Outside state. Don't prefer sending her to North East states as it will be far. Also Delhi being Delhi has scope for much better opportunities. I feel Civil will be the best bet for her. 

- She could prepare for Software - get ample free time
- She could continue in Civil - get through IES
- prepare for UPSC - being at Delhi might help
- go for MBA 

Engineering Physics can be beneficial only if she is highly interested and capable in Physics and would want to go for Higher Studies. That she doesn't have any idea of at this stage. 

What do you advice? For eg. Someone suggested to get into Thapar Electronics but I don't think that would be a good idea. DTU is way better collg than Thapar imo. Only dampener is, I have heard, that there is NO branch-change in DTU!? Any other options???

Kindly help. I don't have much idea about jee mains and am confused by so many number of colleges.",poco_gamer," What does she herself want?

She should go for BioTech or Engineering Physics if she is interested in academic research (which generally means that she would have to pursue further studies/PhD). 

IMO software industry is stale and hopeless. 

I personally would advise her to go for research (cause I think more Indians should do that) but then again not everyone is made for research and it depends on what she wants too. I doubt She'l get CE or EP, to be honest. Chances are more towards Environmental and BT, can you point me to the cut off list of 2018 which says 50k got Civil?

Did a aunty ask you ""beta when are you getting married? It's too late.. bring your mom a bahu!"" 🤣🤣 Superiority complex. Nobody wants to feel shit because their life is fucked up. So they will capitalize every opportunity in the name of ""wisdom"". It's a common defense mechanism for such people. Because 

1. They want to fuck up your life too.
2. They have nothing else to do.
3. Their own kids do not listen to them and they are depressed. [removed] [removed] I never understand this. How elders think it's right for them to give unsolicited advice, but when i gave unsolicited advice to them, they get offended. 🤷 Was having my breakfast on the go while waiting for my cab, an elderly lady stops, tells me without anyy greetings, beta zindagi me yaad rakhna kabhi aaj ke baad chaurahe ke beech khade hoke khana mat khana!
And mf just walks away????

How do i disable these pop up notifications  indians believe a person should get respect on basis of his age not for the person he is. youngesters are expected to respect them and elders are expected to guide youngsters and young one is expected to follow that advice. it's just social expectation from elders to give advice  Superiority complex, mixed with the fact that they have a sense of pride and entitlement, that only god knows where it comes from.

Just had 2 uncles I barely know lecture me about my future career plans, with incorrect information and textbook suggestions and just straight away told me all my future plans are shit and they know better, when they themselves are living a less than mediocre life. Kept staring at my shoes and taunting me how I'll earn the littlest amount of money get lost in brands (the only brand he named was Nike, cause he kept glancing at my shoes) and how after that I'll throw away my money and ruin my life.

So when you get this ""free ki advice"", just ""smile and nod boys, smile and nod."" You learn from experiences and they advice you not to take decisions that they took which fucked up their life. I guess cause Indian society is more family oriented compared to western societies which tend to be more individualistic. Eastern countries have historically had a more community/family based social dynamics , look at Japan, China , India etc or its just that they are looking out for someone they care about .  Everyone is clueless but we all want a better life. Doesn't matter if you listen to them or not. What does matter is YOU can show them a way to better life.  Speaking from their experiences. Hey man if you feel it's good advice follow it, if not let it slide. It's not like they keep nagging you. If they are in case just tell that ""mom told me not to listen to you"" Worked couple of times.  They have a lot of free time.  Shastron me ise muft ka gyaan pelna kaha Gaya hai. Every elder is an expert in every field. You give them some chai and they be discussing quantum mechanics with you.  10/10 You will do the same when you're *elder*.

[AskIndia] How do you keep yourself fit?,46,aq83ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aq83ya/askindia_how_do_you_keep_yourself_fit/,48,"What does your exercise routine look like? 

What are your short and long term fitness goals? 

What kind of diet do you follow? 

If you don't train then what's stopping you? 

Any fitness related achievement you want to share?

Edit: I am not seeking any advice here, I just want everyone to share their routines and spark a discussion so that people can ask questions to each other and learn. 

",LongDraft," I didn't realize the importance of deiting till I got into medschool.

Some tips:

 -You need 1g /kg body weight of protein to keep you fit everyday. So if your weight is 70kg eat 70g of protein everyday. 1 egg contains 6g of protein. If you're trying to lose weight, egg white : egg yolk ratio should be 2:1.
Soya beans , sprouts and lentils are good sources of protein. 


- Count your calories. If you're trying to loose weight eat less than your daily RDA. Google Indian RDA to check what's yours according to your weight. Approx. 2400 for males and 2000 for females. It's not rocket science , once you start counting and managing it'll become easier. 


-  Exercise? 

 I do warm up first followed by

 500 skips (60fast 40slow)

 70 burpees

 100 push ups 

They can be divided in sets of 3

 Abs workout

 
 And individual group of muscles (chest, back , shoulders etc)


- If you swim after that it's a bonus.

Try reading about High Intensity Interval training. 

- Drink lots of water and cut off sugar. Eat stuff like watermoln and cucumber it's low calorie, high fibre and keeps you hydrated. 


- Do something that makes you feel relaxed for me it's Swimming and Mediation (highly recommended, you should be fit mentally and physically)

Have patience it'll take atleast 3 months for you to notice chages. 

 If you just want to lose weight, don't exercise.
Just create a calorie deficit by eating less and moving more. (Moving includes regular walking and general activity)

If you want to get fit and build your body, you should take more protein, less carbs and workout more. Doing this will increase your hunger and appetite. So if you stop working out midway, there's a chance of gaining more weight and fat. 

So workout only if you can commit to your plan. Or else just eat less and create a calorie deficit to lose weight.  hit gym regularly. Initially you gain weight. But if you are regular you would tone up. Results will keep you going afterwards. 

Don’t diet, eat regular meals. reduce the quantity of carbohydrates (chapathi,rice) increase quantity of the sides (veg,meat) as much. eat seasonal fruits nothing fancy. 

drink water.


keep going!! Was never fat, cycle most days a week, play with a sponge ball in the terrace alone at night because I'm a loser, and that's how I keep my weight in check I walk 10k steps early in the morning in a nearby park. 

My weight has gone from 107.8kg to 96.4 kg in 3 months. My goal right now is to hit 70kg.

I count the calories in my food and ensure that there's a calorie deficit. I eat anything but stay within my calorie limit. For more info go to /r/loseit.  [deleted] **Exercise Routine**

Monday/Wednesday/Friday = bodyweight workouts sourced from the Recommended Routine from r/bodyweightfitness

Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday = different running workouts, between 3.5 and 10km incorporating sprints, fartlek running, easy runs etc.

I mix in yoga whenever I can remember to do some, and will sub in things like football, rock-climbing/bouldering etc whenever I can get a good group of friends together to go for this stuff.

I also make it a hard rule to always walk to where I'm going if it's a distance of less than 2.5km.

**Diet**

I don't follow a diet at all, beyond basic moderation. Try to stick to unprocessed food, but don't break my head over it. I enjoy cooking and baking and eating out wayyyy too much to let it stress me out; I do make sure I get at least 5 helpings of fruits/veggies a day, and eat a lot less rice. It also helps that I hardly ever drink (once in 6 months), and don't smoke.

**Short and Long-Term Fitness Goals**

Short-Term: maintain regularity (I've been working out using the above template for about 2.5 years now).

Long-Term: Achieve some of the more hardcore calisthenic movements/holds (human flags, iron cross, front lever, etc).

**Motivation**

My main motivations are to find an outlet for my stress/anxiety, and to maintain some level of control over my health.

I've always had issues with stress and anxiety, to the point of panic attacks, but working out (in conjunction with therapy) has helped that out a *lot* so knowing that helps me stay motivated whenever I feel like slacking off. 

Exercise to me is just a means to an end, the end being a motivated and healthy body with enough energy to help me get through the rest of my day/deal with my other life goals. So i'm not too fussed about perfecting my physique or going HAM on my diet. Accepting that has helped me be at peace with the fact that I might not be progressing nearly as fast as some of my friends who are more focused/dedicated. Exercise routine is to go to the gym 5 days a week for about 45 mins, each day for a separate body part. I start with legs and get it out of the way because its the most strenuous of the lot. Then I move on to chest, shoulders, back, arms.  


Short term fitness goal is actually to feel happy, I go for the dopamine rush more than anything. Long term, I hope to get away from being skinny fat to toning up a bit, nothing too extravagant  


Diet: I just don't keep eating till I'm full, and don't eat junk often. That should be more than enough for maintaining decent fitness. People recommending fancy diets have outlandish goals as well, I have no such plans.  


Achievement: Clothes fit better, I don't look like a scrawny teenager anymore, and I feel more confident in general. I’ve been following the r/nSuns program the last few months, and have experienced great results. 

I’ve also been keeping track of my diet, and overall, feel fitter and stronger by the day.  I mostly just do jogging after waking up and then some hanging exercises on the hanging bar followed by 50 pushups and 50 squats.  Guys Get a mi scale. This gives a wake up call to you. My body fat and Visceral levels are way above. We always have a positive self -image pg our bodies. 

The readings make me more aware of the food I am consuming . 
 Routine: 5/3/1 Boring but big, T-Nation challenge  https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/boring-but-big-3-month-challenge

So I don’t do the accessories there, only the main lifts. I accessorise using metallicadpa PPL with the pull lifts on Bench and OHP day, and push lifts on the active rest days with legs on the deadlift and squat day. 

Cardio 20 minutes on bench and ohp day, 30 minutes on ActiveRest and no cardio on leg day. 

Diet: I am currently eating around 2300kcal since I’m cutting. I go upto 3200 while bulking. My minimum aim is 200gms of protein. Eat 1kg chicken everyday, bulking or cutting. No whey or protein powders. Do take creatine and citrulline.Lots and lot of veggies, wheat bran for fibre. Sometimes I’ll do keto, so I’ll eat cauliflower otherwise it’s always rice (just convenient to cook and pack). 

Goals: Strength, strength and strength. Currently my stats are 192/160/105kgs on deadlift/squat/bench. Aim for end of year is 230/200/150 while keeping my weight same. Currently around 80kgs body weight at approx 16% body fat. Want to reach 12% at same weight (or maybe 2kgs lesser).

Also, I make sure I clock 30kms/week running.    
 I know a lot of people are asking you to eat healthy and control diet, but in India, that's next to impossible. The average meals at home/hostel/hotel are really lacking in nutrition, as they're mostly carbs.

After multiple attempts, I finally switched to Intermittent Fasting. Read up on it, it's an easy method and doesn't require you to to alter your lifestyle massively. Dropped 7 kilos in 2 months, along with basic workout - push-ups, pull-ups, and squash twice a week.

The thing is, you must try out every method, but find your own. Most gyaan people dish out is what worked for THEM. ",AskIndia,2019-02-14 00:07:33

Bhai fans are generally assholes.

Restaurants that promise 100 varieties of dosa usually cannot make even a basic dosa properly.

",UngilUndy," Public chutiya hai.  Indian people don't really care much for their lives.

well most of em.. the way roads are crossed, the way trains are clinged on, the way cars are driven, the way electricity lines/boards are set up, the way no-one cares about allowing access to handicaps, the way people wanna go before the ambulance... i can go on and on and on.

it's weird that people show fright when they watch horror movies or when some mob gathers to beat them but the way they go about living each day of their lives doesn't show they care much about taking care of themselves. (i've seen this hold especially true in ""macho men"" and less in women.) [removed] Activists only care for issues while the issues themselves are unpopular or not talked about.  Because they get off on the feeling of being the only ones fighting for it.

They throw protests with 12 people at cafes nobody visits and then complain that society doesn't take the issue seriously.

The moment their issues get momentum from the masses, they find some reason to criticize the movement and stay out of them. When someone popular takes up an issue (like an actor who has 10000x more reach than any activist) or when it becomes a hashtag with millions of people taking part, they won't try use this momentum to strengthen the movement. They'll just belittle it and write long think pieces about how the public/personality is missing the point or how everyone else is wrong and how they and they alone understand the true nuance of the situation.

When the Nirbhaya movement saw massive crowds form across the country, I noticed so many ""feminist"" activists stay out of it because it was a middle-class protest and because ""where were you"" when previous rapes had happened. They criticized the movement instead of adding to it.

I've noticed this happen so many times on so many different issues that I've given up thinking it's limited to just one branch of social activism. My generalization is that activists hate when the people actually take up their issue, because they no longer feel like its ""their"" issue. > Parents are always right. Whatever they do is for your good.

Whenever I encounter such people, which is everyday on the Internet, I temporarily lose my objectivity and feel this country has completely earned the mess she's in and then I begin picturing a day when this regime has the bhakts themselves running for their lives.  Modi fans are Modi fans only because they hate Muslims. They don't give a rat's arse about jobs, growth, Ram Mandir, Gau Mata or any other bullshit. As long as Muslims are harassed, all's well.

You can be happier if you never married.  - Average IITian is smarter than average student from tier II colleges.

PS: I am not an IITian. Talking from experience at workplace. Civic sense in India is very poor I used to work in an office with 75% females. My female colleagues and friends who had children were so overworked, stressed, miserable that it left an impression on my mind. (This was a great company to work for,  they had flexible work hours and WFH options for moms). I would not want my wife to go through that. I am not the kind who would ever stop my partner from pursuing her dreams and career, but I want to make sure that I can earn enough and provide a good life for my family on my own.

Most of my friends think I am silly for refusing the extra income, but at what cost? I'd rather prefer if my wife stayed home and raised my kids than busting her ass for a few lakhs more per year.

Edit: Thanks for sharing your opinions people. This thread is about unpopular opinions, so I shared mine. I am not rigid about what I want, and I am definitely not the kind who think I have the right to impose my will on another adult. Far left and far right wing people are a disaster for a country. Men are awesome. A girl is born sealed from birth until it is opened.

I have a counter for this. Bhai fans are assholes, and they tend to avoid tax, and hence they don't support demonetization :D Ye bikk gayi hai society Civilization is the worst thing happened to us.

Morals and ethics doesn't exist outside human frame of reference. Doing ₹8 worth of work where ₹7 worth of work was required, and claiming to have done work worth ₹100, that one time 5 years back, is our definition of working hard, and excuse for not doing shit now. Entire south tambi/kallu
Entire north north I don't think any of what you wrote is an unpopular generalisation.

In that vein, I'll add some further generalisations:

* Autodrivers are generally assholes.

* Kids driving superbikes are maniacs and I won't shed a tear if their rash driving ends up killing them. Especially when they don't wear helmets. 

* Fuck Royal Enfield. If your dick is small, don't try to compensate by riding a noisy bike.

* Every five years, just vote out whoever is in power. Both Congress and BJP will fuck things up - it's best not to let them have two terms consecutively. 

* Old people should learn to shut the fuck up when it comes to the younger generation. You raised us. We have to deal with the problems you created or couldn't solve. So after a point, you really need to shut the fuck up since your chance is passed.

* If you disagree with something, downvoting doesn't change my mind. Use your words. [removed] [deleted] 1. Those who complain that others are X Y Z are basically talking about themselves. I am yet to meet an open minded person who keeps criticizing others non stop. Sure they will talk shit one day or another but not 24 x 7.

2. ""Feminism"" in India is different from actual Feminism started as suffrage movement by Ms Pankhurst. Feminism means I wont disrespect a woman's opinion just because she is a woman.

3. Men and women need to understand the differences in the gender. Men need to realise that women have their own brain and self respect. Not all need constant pampering and looking down upon. That you are equally responsible for your household. Only girls r not responsible.

4. Generally ppl don't complain for things until it starts affecting themselves.

5. The issue isn't that you have stress or problems in your life, the issue is you don't know how to deal with it Society pokes its nose into anything and everything. ",AskIndia,2019-01-14 15:44:05
"[AskIndia]South Indian Supporters of RSS, why do they believe in Hindutva?",24,awasht,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/awasht/askindiasouth_indian_supporters_of_rss_why_do/,101,"AFAIK Hindutva/RSS's idea of Nationalism stems from the European idea of Nationalism and not the Gandhian one. RSS hasn't adjusted its core ideology to be ethnically inclusive, instead it doubles down with Hindi as a National Language and a North Indian cultural soft power(TBF these issues always plagued the Central Govt but it feels like Hindutva ideology is adding jet fuel to the dormant embers of Hindi-Hindu Majoritarianism).

I find it baffling to see a lot of South Indians on Social Media vociferously supporting RSS. In a Hindi-Hindu Rastra they are ethnic minorities with second class status. And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India than they are towards non-Hindus. Which begs the question, why is there even a single South Indian Bhakt?

**On a Sidenote**: Has the Gandhian idea of India failed? Everything is so hyper&jingoistic these days. A mere mention of ethnic groups existing in India seems to trigger outrage&accusations of anti-nationalism. ",OmegaMaleX," South India is not a monolithic culture. 



Within TN post independence rationalist, and Tamil movements took root allowing little space for Hindutva politics of RSS or Hindu Mahasabha. Even congress's influence waned  after Kamaraj. DMK continued to propagate athiestic world view( unless electorally inconvenient) whereas AIADMK has always been ambivalent about religion. JJ was never overly athiestic. 

As rationalist politics and Tamil  pride politics got run  over by caste politics and welfare measures
, there are some pockets especially in the upper caste who want to wear their religion on their sleeves, and have also felt marginalized these many decades. Remember these were the 'villains'  in the Periyar and Anti caste movements. This minority is now turning towards hindutva.

 AIADMK becoming a BJP puppet, and  BJP's vast spending on PR and social media lends greater visibility as well.



Kerala is surprisingly conservative as a society. BJP has managed to infest a few pockets, and has piggy backed on the Sabarimala issue (after initially supporting entry of women). They have had  nearly no impact on electoral politics till now though.



Karnataka is the only state where BJP has been able to form a govt. 

Thing to note here is that unlike other southern states Karnataka was not administered as a single entity pre independence. Karnataka today is an amalgamation of Mysore kingdom, North Karnataka ( part of Bombay province) and other parts of Madras presidency. Though a common language and past empires ( Hoysala, Satavahana , Vijayanagar etc) united the territories within the state, a cohesive state consciousness and politics is yet to emerge in my opinion.  

Different parts of Karnataka have thier political heavyweights. Mysore region dominated by JD(S) with Congress second. NK Congress. Coastal Karnataka and Malnad is where BJP is strongest. In fact coastal areas have suffered from the poison of hatred filled saffron cultural goondaism ( remember Sri Ram Sene and the pink chaddi movement? ). 

Although there have been rationalist movements in the past, and rationalist literature has seen its hey  day, hindutva's appeal is mainly political except for pockets mentioned earlier. 

I have no clue about AP and TN Mainly because they only resonate with the ""Hindu"" part. To them Modi, RSS and bjp stand for ""Hindutva"" or ""Hinduism"" . Also a lot of the supporters mostly belong to upper caste Brahmins who feel Rss and BJP alone are a party worth voting for (never mind how they are actually treated) and see Congress as a ""non hindu/Muslim party"". [deleted] In South it's usually the upper castes who have this North culture(Hindi Sanskrit and cow) worshipping nature. For them native culture of their land is not their culture. If you ask some Tamil brahmins they will claim sanskrit is their mother tongue.

This also explains why Marathi brahmins have historically been pro Hindi and running the RSS instead of sticking to Marathi language.

How much this narrative affects the state politics is function of their population and influence.
That explains the clear irrelevance of this hindi-hindu ideology in TN and it's significance elsewhere  I think it's just hatred towards Muslims that drives them to RSS/hindutva.  Everyone votes based on caste lines. Even the upper caste people. Who will have a higher representation on social media.  [deleted] 1. Conversions and Other religions: By making them the strawmen.
2. Positive Image: Because they are projecting themselves as representatives/guardians of Hinduism. 
3. About Hindi: Local RSS functions in the local language but the love for Hindi comes from believing that English is not good for their culture. English education is how one becomes ""westernised"". They paint English as the destructive force. Gandhi kinda comes off as racist and undoubtedly casteist. He is a bad marker of moral behvaiour tbh.  [deleted] Wow, slow clap OP!

This discussion is petty at best. If anything, the RSS wants a United India, not a country further squabbling about who's from the North and what language they speak of. Nobody is imposing Hindi on South India, other than the imagination of people who are inherently racist. Believing that someone else is a racist makes the person a racist too. [removed] ""And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India""

Out of the loop on this. What has RSS said on Aryan/dravidian divide? Any references.  Faith and Country are two distinct things. History between the two religions has been pretty rough. One of them got the rough deal while the other got away easy and is now playing the victim. So this misappropriation will make every Hindu latch onto any organization that voices its support for them.  It's the TV. TV should have the same sort of warnings as on cigarette packs. A lot of southie right wing supporters are very badly educated if you look at it, the rest are clever and want to capitalize on a situation and extract some sort of political power from this stupidity.",AskIndia,2019-03-02 06:48:51
[AskIndia] What are some one time purchases that improved your life significantly?,120,9yezn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9yezn3/askindia_what_are_some_one_time_purchases_that/,277,I purchased a 300ml thermos last year. fucking best purchase ever. now I have homemade tea wherever the fuck I want. What about you?,CaptainPoverty," Those mosquito killer racqets. Significantly improved the evenings in our hostel. I feel like I am a walking murderer with my weapon.  Sony WH1000xm3's

Cant hear everybodys shit now A kindle . 

I didn't buy books cuz they were costly . Just invested in a kindle and read a lot of books . 

An Audible Subscription ( Audio books).  
When I got to working I had an hour long commute on either side , instead of just listening to the same old songs , I got a trial subscription and abused the fuck out of it.  I got myself a hard medical mattress. Man, it improved my sleeping so much. Never realised that my previous spinal pain episodes were induced by the soft and springy mattress.

Best purchase decision in the last 5 years, honestly. Good knife for the kitchen, and a 'combination stone' to keep the knife sharp. A multimeter.

There's only one 'combination stone' available in the market, and that is [this](https://www.amazon.in/Cumi-CSSC109-Combination-Silicone-Carborundum/dp/B00S86FA6M/) available online at \~Rs. 240 and offline(at least here in Sec'bad) at \~Rs. 135/-

[This](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/VICI-VC87-LCD-Digital-Multimeter-True-RMS-DMM-for-Motor-Drives-w-Frequency-Capacitance-Temperature-hFE/32701610512.html) (which cost me \~$99.00 at the time) is the multimeter I have since \~4 years. [This](https://www.amazon.in/Mastech-MAS830L-Digital-Pocket-Multimeter/dp/B0093H048Y) (which cost me \~Rs. 400/-) is what I upgraded from. Air purifier. I live in Delhi Caterpillar trekking shoes when they were available in market about a decade back. Shit still has enough life for another 10 years Noise cancellation headphones (Bose QC 30) for flights. I take at least 2 flights a week and I can sleep on morning flights because of it. 



 Cordless vacuum cleaner. Cleaning house is so much easier, and now house gets cleaned more often. I was putting off buying a microwave for years. It has been life changing since I got it. I get to eat hot food again like it was just prepared. People on the edge, just go ahead and buy it. It's totally worth it.  I bought (almost jokingly) one of those make-up brushes for women to clean my laptop. Lo and behold I clean each and every gadget (and other precious items) with it nowadays. 
Link for those interested: https://www.amazon.in/Vega-Wooden-Handle-Natural-Synthetic/dp/B00791F224/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1542636877&sr=8-5&keywords=vega+makeup+brushes A basic cycle from decathlon. Use this frequently now instead of car for short distances. Got a UPS 5yrs ago... almost forgotten abt power cuts  SSD for my laptop. It is noticeably faster now. An electric shaver/trimmer by Philips. Got it for like 700 something during some promotion. Used to have a lot of skin problems that now I know to be due to my earlier means of shaving (razor/cartridge style blades). Sure, they don't give a close shave but it is good enough and does not cause a lot of skin problems that may happen when you use a blade of any kind on skin. I listen to a lot of podcasts and relaxation/lounge music. But using earphones for longer periods is inconvenient. So I bought a JBL Flip 3 during the sale and I just let it play on my disk while I work. It has a 12 hr battery on 50% volume pleasant to hear. The LG gram laptop for 70k. Batter is soooooooo long. Always lasts full day. And it's only around 900 something gram.

I can now code all day without breaking my back.  A Chromecast, honestly. Don't know why anyone would go for a smart TV anymore. Offers very little functionality over the relatively cheap device.  I collected money for 1year and brought adidas shoes. And it was my best purchase. After that i realised shoes are most important to feel comfortable. I bought a hydroflask 720 ml insulated bottle. 

Cold water all the time!

It was a little expensive but its also got a lifetime warranty theres that.  In Delhi, you get these electric charge hot water bags. Cost 200-250 Rs. Very comfortable in winters. Not one, but almost any high quality item I have purchased has served me really, really well. In contrast, whenever I've saved money on things, they ended up either requiring a lot of repairs or downright upgrading quicker than I thought. Here are a few top picks:

1. Memory foam mattress (significantly improves sleep)
2. High end running shoes from Decathlon (reduce strain on your ankles, don't skimp on shoes!)
3. A 27"" 4K monitor (Man, this thing is amazing to watch movies and youtube on, as well as general browsing and coding. If you are using a laptop, seriously consider attaching it to a monitor and getting wireless keyboard and mouse)
4. A gearless scooter in Bangalore: Here, public transport is non-existent, Uber is too slow/expensive and auto guys fleece you hard. Scooter will easily run you down 8000-10000 km a year and if you think of 20 rupees per km for Uber(standard in Bangalore), it justifies the cost of scooter + fuel in less than a year. Also, gearless is much easier to drive in city traffic.

&#x200B;

In contrast, the cheap chair I bought gives me back pains after long sessions(trying to get rid of it at a loss :( ), the 8 years old second hand fridge required several repairs, and the cheap laptop I bought gave me heating issues and horrible battery life. I have learned my lesson that good stuff lasts longer and pays for itself in that time. Amazon Alexa along with a few connected lights. Very convenient to have it all synced up. Also, if you cook a fair bit or just enjoy cooking, get a good quality knife or 2. Makes cooking so much nicer. [A monitor stand from Amazon basics](https://imgur.com/gallery/xYmihOM) Bought some TheraBands, now  exercise at home. I am way more regular at working out.  A house A laptop cooling pad. Do not worry about laptop heating now. * Water Filter - No more need to buy water Cans 
* Cartini Serated knife 
* Car air pump 
 Chromecast is great. Purchasing dashcam also makes me feel safe while driving. Chromecast... really dont wanna see anything in a small phone screen now.  A good quality mattress with pillow that suits your body.

No amount of exercise and yoga can help your body if your mattress and pillow are not comfortable(doesn't always need to be soft). You spend most of your life of bed(average 6+ hours) so compromising with it is not a good idea.

&#x200B;

I fall asleep fast, have less back and neck pain and cramps even after long duration of sleep thanks to one good investment I made. Raspberry Pi (mini computer board). Installed Kodi. Watching movies from hard disk and YouTube ad free is priceless. Condom strawberry flavor  live in the UK and also spend lot of time in india during holidays so I needed a phone that supports both indian 4g frequency bands and british

Phones in UK are expensive AF, everybody walking around with iphone X or galaxy s8

&#x200B;

Researched before buying, made up my mind on buying global version redmi note 4 for 120 pounds (yes the currency not weight), and dont regret anything.

&#x200B; Harman Kardon Soundsticks II  


I got them almost 7 years ago during some sale on Flipkart, I think. Picked 'em up for about Rs 7,000. They are by far the most exquisite sounding home-speakers I've owned.

It runs off flash storage so it's much faster than my desktop and laptop. It has a really good 1080p IPS screen and weighs practically nothing (it's like 1.5kg) so I do all my viewing on it.

[AskIndia] Tell me an yesterday's non-news around you and your neighborhood,79,atcz0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/atcz0u/askindia_tell_me_an_yesterdays_nonnews_around_you/,90,"News is only when something shit happens. Non-news should be a thing in today's world of instant news and instant shit. Sanity in this insane world that we've never imagined we'll ever be is non-news. And it should be yesterday because you've been through it and it's fresh in mind. I'll go first.

1. Yesterday I saw three donkeys after a very long time. I used to see and hear them almost everywhere. They've become a rare sight while I am growing up. They look old and don't look like they are in a good shape.
2. Yesterday I thought for few minutes why wasn't I am seeing monkeys in my neighborhood? They used to be everywhere in my childhood. That once again reminded me of a video made by one History professor on Pigeons in US. In early 19^th century 
2. Yesterday I watched a video on retrograde motion of Mars ~~mercury (and also sun)~~ again after a very long time. This time around I really wondered what it takes to observe such a motion. 

    a. First, curiosity of what's out there in the space; instead of just ignoring because it's been always there and can be seen everyday.

    b. Keep seeing one specific part of space, notice a specific object in the sky

    c. Identify the same object the next day

    d. Notice that that specific object has shifted it's position in fucking space and not a coordinate plane.  mean, you've got to have much more than a photographic memory to keep track of location of an object in space

   e. This comes before (d). The idea that I should keep track of it's location when you never knew it could move around/rotate/revolve.

    f. And the notice that the movement is strange. How many of us (in India) would do this in 21^st century? Apparently, this was observed by Greeks back in ~ 200 BC.
   
4. One auntie got mad at her husband/children and was screaming and shouting in no particular direction for a long time, even after they're gone. It seemed to stop at lunch time
5. I thought I should try making dosa using Chik Peas (Channa?) Yesterday I made batter and today morning I tried making dosas. It was a disaster. Was able to make just one dosa and it did taste dammed good. I am trying to make idli with the rest of the batter. It's work in progress.
6. All of a sudden Elpy mode is freezing my emacs. Need to find out why soon. I can't stand a monster memory guzzler Intellij.
7. Yesterday I bought 1KG really good tomatoes for 11 bucks.

I'll add any unremarkable, utterly boring, inconsequential events that I can recollect. Share your non-news and get back to your choice of slavery.",UUUU__UUUU," I overheard an old age aunty saying I love you to her husband. Made me smile.  After many many years, I just wandered around aimlessly on a two wheeler to explore surroundings last week. Found out there were 4-5 farms in 5km radius of my house, saw roads where they had good asphalt but nobody uses them, developed layouts with acres of empty land and a lot of cattle. It felt like a developed village with a dairy and old houses. There was a temple and outside a lot of old people sat to chat in the evening. I joined them and the chat went from their childhood stories to their oldage stories, their efforts and how you need to be a good person before a rich person.

It felt like I paused a day off my normal schedule and experienced something so small yet so beautiful.  Motu the dog barked for exactly 134 minutes straight last afternoon. Motu needs to stfu [deleted] A sweet Bhabhiji slipped down in the mud at bus stop yesterday morning. She was screaming at her son for being serious on exam day while the 7 year old bachcha was singing a song. I saw a dead cat yesterday. He was a stray but me and neighbours used to feed him.
RIP. Today morning I woke up  I am looking for a new job since people higher up the ladder blame the lowest pebble (me) for anything that goes wrong. My roommate got a job offer that pays more than his current manager's salary. We spent a while talking about the incompetent middle management at his current company and then went to the roof and had a few beers.

Also saw two kids popping wheelies on a beater 100cc bike. The second dude was almost hanging from the back in order to create enough leverage for the front wheel to stay up. I had deleted Ola app because of Rs.50 cancellation fee it slapped on me. But yesterday, I had to book Ola auto for my aunts. So, after a gap of almost 6 months, I re-installed Ola app and paid the damn fine (100 rupees) and booked Ola auto ride. [removed] After a long time, I went to skiing with my friends to Gulmarg. We stayed the night there and during sunset looking at those mighty Himalayas was one of the best sights I have seen till far by now.  A stray cat mom abandoned her 2 kitties in the building I stay. These kitties have settled to staying on the stairs and running up and down when someone uses the stairs. I ended up pitying them and kept milk and some cat food at my house doorsteps and they started to trust me. This was all cute and fun until they decided to play with our shoes, threw my nikes outside the building and shat all our entrance lol. Don't know how to respond to them now I am aiming to get my first job this summer. 
 After dropping my brother at the railway station yesterday, I went to the temple i used to go to every Tuesday with my mom. Felt good. Vultures are coming back. just saw 2 yesterday. such awesome birdies  Killer idea OP hope this becomes a thing (or a future website in which case HMU!)

A few days ago, my neighbour's plot caught fire. I thought it was intentionally done to clear the overgrowth. Such huge flames. I was cursing the mentality we have to use fire to clear our fields.

Later, I found out that the fire was accidental. However, the owner returned and found that since half the field was cleared, he might as well finish the job. Burned the rest off as well.

Supposedly, it's good for the soil and the ash can help the trees. What, 11 bucks for 1KG tomatoes? Its 20 bucks here.

Though I got 3 carrots and 2 small capsicums for 10 bucks, that was a good deal afaik.

 Man, now that you have mentioned donkeys, I don't remember seeing one in months :o.
Also, came across [this guy. ](https://i.imgur.com/oP180VO.jpg) Too fucking busy to notice anything other than desperation of elected officials

I saw more sign boards being posted on roadside in last week compared to last 5yrs.

MLA came to our society and asked if any work needs to be done

All roads r dug out because they r building new ones

A lot of dust on the road.

And not getting enough sleep, a family function this weekend so too busy I saw this and I like it. Quite relaxing to hear the small stuff that affects people. Puts into perspective the damage social media, 24x7 news, FOMO has done to us. A part of this world moves at lightning speed and another part moves leisurely. 1. Today, I finished my first ever new york times crossword after months and months of trying to do them. It was one of the greatest feelings and i celebrated by eating a vanilla ice cream. Had not had ice creams for ages before today afternoon.

2. There is a stray cat which roams around my building. I stay on the 5th floor. She comes up daily and just stares at me while i cook and clean. I want to adopt it but I am not entirely sure its a stray.

3. Yesterday, i saw house sparrows after A LONG LONG time. Decided to keep some grains of rice on my balcony. They have not noticed it yet. Hopefully, tomorrow. *Yesterday, I wanked all by myself...* Yesterday I learnt that my roommate has been a headache ever since and my flatmates actually want her out. 

I don't want to be a part of their petty war and it's been only 3 days since I moved out.

:/ Electricity department replaced a damaged light pole that was in middle of the street. The entire activity took about 3 hours with about 12 15 onlookers with special interest. By the way the truck bringing the new pole had a flat tire for no reason and had to be repaired. Visited my parents side of Hyderabad yesterday.

The constable who harassed my friends and I when we were younger has built a three story house with the bribes he collected. This is a gem of a thread. The saddest part is reading about the missing birds and animals. I am glad people are noticing. This should be a weekly thread

***Weekly Non-News of India*** The pig in my friend's backyard pooped lesser today Wow. Such a nice post. This should be weekly thing. Good going OP. :)

Also, yesterday, I finally picked up a pencil again after 2-3 weeks, to practice drawing. Not exactly yesterday (since I was traveling for the last 26 hours) but last week.

1. Visited Delhi for the first time. I've been to Delhi before but my time has always been spent either in the Metro or places close to the railway station.

2. Realized that a lot of the shops I used to eat at when I was a kid have been trying to modernize and have lost the old touch. I wanted to show off this old school shop where they made a big mug of lassi in a kulhad to my SO. However, the lassi doesn't taste the same anymore. Felt bad because it was an experience that I wanted to share but couldn't and that shop was a big part of my city experience growing up. My dad's phone got stolen some assholes snatch it off his hand. They were on a bike. Feelsbadman.

 Now I'll have to be careful too! Delhi ain't that safe even for men. :( Here is my non news: saw some post about an idiot talking garbage like he bought tomatoes for 11 bucks.

I stay in Bengal and here we see more mosquitoes during Winter, especially in North Bengal. Whereas you don't see much mosquitoes during the summer.  In Mumbai, I feel it's the bad in summer.

Advantage of living in small flats in Mumbai is that you have a lot of control over the air coming in (limited windows) and can easily eliminate mosquitoes. 

Downside is, crazy Hugh dengue rates. No Civic authority cares.  Oh, so this is where they migrate to in winter! My dude, you got it backwards. Winters are best because there's almost no mosquitos.

Their reasons can vary - fear of societal disappointment, anxiety, depression, heartbreak, etc. It has much to do with the work culture of Japan, with its insanely long working hours, high expectations, conformity, and rigid social rules. I'd suggest reading about [Hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori) and checking out some of the IAMAs done on it. And the anime, Welcome to the NHK.

**Now, the point: would you say that this is happening to some degree in India as well?**

Some of the factors that cause this are common here. Japan is very different from India so let's get past that bit. However, we do have similarities. Indians are [increasingly overworked](https://qz.com/india/1030594/indian-millennials-are-overworked-and-sick-of-office-politics/) with most of our workers [burning out](https://qz.com/india/1401250/indias-unhealthy-workforce-stands-in-the-way-of-economic-growth/) from unhealthy conditions. [Indians are lonely](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/india-obsession-with-sons-millions-of-lonely-men-after-dowry/7903134) and many millions will, statistically, die alone. This is not to count the actual problem that we have no dating culture in India, and the fact that most men are unlikely to be well-socialized with women - who then watch movies about romance and start to wonder why their lives don't match up with what's on screen. Indian male loneliness is crippling, and prevalent, in my opinion.

Like Japan, we also have strong family structures, so that an unemployed youth staying at home and slowly rotting away isn't uncommon. In fact, in Kerala, I would say every family has one. There are cousins and uncles - people who for unexplained reasons end up doing nothing but staying at home. We have people who strike out into depression after failing the IIT-JEEs and AIEEEs or back papers, who stay home and seldom if not never come out. I'm sure many have posted on this subreddit as well. 

**One strange parallel I feel we have with the Hikikomori is the IAS aspirant**. There is a degree of social isolation and staying-at-home-for-years that happens with both IAS aspirants and Hikikomori that really strikes me. OFC not all IAS aspirants are the same but I know one shut-in and one on his way to becoming one, perhaps. Anyway this is just my view.

What do you think, though? Are a lot of young Indians locking themselves away from society as well? Have you ever felt the urge? Any discussion appreciated. 

I write as someone who's been unemployed for a good year now and I can feel the yawning chasm of social reclusion approach. Most of my year was at home, though I took gaps to travel. This was more a recluse from my career than from socializing, though I do feel I've been meeting fewer new people than I normally do.

I do believe that his is happening, though quietly. In a country like ours, it's easy to be forgotten.",RagiModi," Damn, I didn't know that the thing I have been doing since long has a name!  ""beta to, aage ka kya socha hai?""

""kuch nhi aunty bas pani bhar jaaye to motor off ker dunga"" This is really good observation. I think it is bound to happen if it's not already happening.

Young educated Indians are facing a drastic mental pressure as soon as they're done with their studies.

And, Indian society is very structured and surprisingly united in holding on to its dogmas. While young people are still figuring out what's on their mind, they're buried under the societal shit of finding a 'suitable' job, marriage, giving their parents grandkids to play with, buying a vehicle, buying a house, etc. And before they'd realize what's on their mind, most of them would be no longer young.

Some young people cannot take it, they break away and become recluse. A few others, desperate to prove themselves to the society, follow mobs, become vandals and cause chaos. But most just suck it up. They learn to live with it. They grow up to either quell the dogmas or propagate them further. I only hope the former triumphs.

I'm sorry if that sounded depressing. I'd be happy if someone could change my mind. I have 0 friends for 3 years, no collage, coaching or job... 0 interaction with anyone except my family, go out once a week... 

Damn! Seems like have Hikikomori for 3 years... I've seen and studied cases where people get into that phase many a times because of medical reasons (like disorders and infectious disease). But it's sad how people become socially withdrawn because of external reasons like a bad breakup, loss of loved one and circumstances of situation. All it needs is a few words from those who care and give support throughout. 

**Solitude** is a state of isolation that is temporary. Like suddenly trying to stay home for a whole week binge watching series and not facing the sun. Some people end up there because of many reasons, and they've been through a lot of shit. Some fall in never to get up and feeling comfortable in a hole because its far better than the shitshow happening outside it. Our education is taking pride in making products (like engineers with MS and MBA in foreign Universities), judging on how much you earn and how rick you look. Nothing else. They have a very stupid yardstick just for judging. Help another guy? Fuck it. 

For dumb people who blame the internet for this, this is the ONLY safe space for many people. Unfortunately, those boxed up isolation chambers contains many hidden gems. There are thousands of Amazing DJs, Great artists, kick-ass gamers who feel its better to be anonymous, chatting with random persons across the globe rather than their own family, because the family is afraid of the society, the shameless society whose only wish is to screw others for fun. This might take generations to recover. But it will.

On a rather real note don't be afraid to open up, especially when you are alone. Ofc there are dumbfucks who might take advantage of it or even use you throughout. Learn your lessons. You'll end up with a few who'll hope for your betterment...Always. There's always people who would find it fun to talk to you and support you. I can be one if you wouldn't mind. My inbox is always open. Stay safe.

&#x200B; A big difference between Japan and India is that Japan is a 1st world country and most people can afford to keep their kids at home doing nothing without a significant change in their lifestyle.

In India, most people can not afford to support an adult without any benefits and parental push or hunger would force a person to work (or become a destitute).

However, in middle and upper middle-class households, I won't be surprised with a rise of Hikkikomori lifestyle. [deleted] [removed] Yes, shitty private college engineering. Holy Shit! Iam one of them. It has made a landfall on our large shitholes (metros) where traffic is where we see outside world (filled with strangers) and mobile is where we socialize. This daily routine coupled with work/studies/family pressure can make even a sane logical thinking person who sees no meaningful outcome with social interactions other than for greed and power go into social isolation. 
India with its growing middle class will be a Hikikomori warehouse in the near future.  Oh god YES!

I've been wanting to make a post like this for a long time. As a 22-year-old, I was probably part of the last generation (in India at least) of kids who spent most of their childhood outside playing/socializing than on digital screens.

I agree with your post, we absolutely have an invisible problem lurking just below the surface of our false outer facade of the 'demographic dividend' potential. We have an insane number of young people, with a super narrow set of opportunities, who're growing up in a culture that absolutely sucks at socializing, dating, and having conversations and [connection with even the fucking neighbors.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indians-in-gated-communities-meet-their-neighbors-online/2012/06/12/gJQAvjPfWV_story.html)

With the spread of the internet (not blaming it, it just catalyzes the worst aspects of the problem), I only see this problem getting worse. Most kids are growing up alone with barely any social skills, and without proper intervention, they'll go on to have terrible lives as adults, and as you noted -- die a lonely death.



 Add me. It's been two years.  Most married women in lower middle class...  [deleted] I live in Japan now and back in 2012-2013 I spent a good six months confined to my room at my parents house in India. I wasn’t unemployed though (I worked remotely), simply tired of people and the mundane routine that was my life. 

I know a few of my friends (in India) who quit their high paying jobs and decided to backpack across the country and live as a free spirit. (they don’t use cellphones). 

We all have our own coping mechanism to deal with life as we know it (mine was gaming and traveling around the world). 引きこもり is just one such way. Its not because of over work it could be anything that causes a person to believe life inside four walls is a better life. Some Hikikomori do work remotely. There are several manga artists, singers, and even developers I know who are Hikikomori but with a profession.  They’ll refuse to make public appearances or do video calls but happily work and text. 

Think of Hikikomori as someone on a house arrest but voluntarily. The house for them is a safe zone (psychologically speaking) where no harm would come to them both physically and mentally. 

You should watch https://youtu.be/wE1UIK85E3E which is a more accurate description of what it is than return to NHK. 

I also recommend these anime “No Game No Life”, “Eromanga sensei” and “re:Life” if you want to explore Hikikomori via anime subculture. 

Feel free to ask me anything you wish to know.  One category everyone of you missed - **unmarried, unemployed women** who have aged beyond what is commonly considered marrying age. Another category is divorced women. These two have existed in Indian culture since time immemorial. I know a few people in these categories. The fear of a girl entering this category is the main reason Indian relatives/parents pressurize girls to get married as soon as possible. Yeah I was one in my early to mid 20s. I only got out because of support of my parents. Though even now I feel detached from the narrow focus of the society around me, and often times struggle with motivation. The only thing that's constant for me is my love of my chosen field. I think it's happening. Not the exact phenomenon but we do have an Indian version of it. 

IT employees in metro cities and IAS aspirants are somewhat the same. It happens very slowly, most them don't even realize this; only after some mid-life crisis hits them. 

But as always, they are not to be blamed. They are the result of a broken system and societal pressures. The day is not far away, when we will see some of them call it quits and move to their native place again or look for a different career option. Despite the so called inclusive society, high levels of social isolation is very common in urban areas.

Nice post btw. For those of us reading from outside India, could you please explain what IAS is? 
Aside from that I think you've made a very well  articulated argument and although I only have a basic understanding of Indian social dynamics, I have spent a good amount of time in Japan and I can potentially see some similarities in the results although I believe the reasons are quite different. In India, the assurance of family support might be the cause despite people having genuine ambition (such as the the friend you've cited), whereas in Japan there seems to be a growing lack of ambition from the get-go. Young people are losing the desire to compete in society, possible for fear of failure. There is also a term for this in Japanese which translates along the lines of ""plant-eating boy"" and refers those young men who would rather stay home than take any risks at all (while being primarily used in the context of dating).  Yes. Mostly because of 2 reasons, the job market is fucked. So parents pressure kids into doing things they have no interest in and in the end it all goes wrong.

Now why is the job market fucked? Pretty sure there are jobs? Correct. The problem is not that there are no jobs. Let's explain with example.

A kid is provided with everything from phone to house to car because his or her parents worked hard and reached the level they are at. Now, the market is so screwed, a person on employment cannot build a decent house in a good area all his/her life. Kids are under pressure to achieve more than their parents because they assume ""my parents earned this, and it's not enough for me.. I gotta earn more"". So they are satisfied with jobs that pay less... but what parents dont usually tell their kids is that they also started with low paying jobs. My father started with 1200 rupees a month and earns 2 lakh a month now. Though it took all life. 

Kids expect they will start at 10 or 20k and then within 3 months it should double... dreams. And even if their parents tell them, they discard it by saying ""tab to sab kuch sata tha"". True it was cheap but their pay was low too? It's the same. 

So simply, these kids have had it all and dont think its necessary to earn because they wont enough for it to mean anything, so why not live on your parents money? And that is how they become shut-in.... that combined fear of judgement from society. 

Hope I could explain properly.  Social media also has it's share in contributing to the problem. It took me some time understanding how society and family influences your desires and what you want to pursue in life. Only a minority would achieve that kind of success early in life which would require talent, hardwork, motivation, ability to focus for long amounts of time and a bit of luck. When you disentangle from all those expectations, you feel light, you finally get to know yourself and what you want to pursue in life. You get to see your flaws in a non-judgemental way and start working on them at your own pace. 

Women's high dating standards in Japan also contributed to the problem. Most women there would prefer to stay single than to date/ marry a average looking/ earning guy. This resulted in men dropping from society. I can see this happening in our country in the very near future. No it will never happen in india in the same manner it happened in japan or not happened all together.

Our society is not made in a way to allow 'space' or too much personal  freedom That they can be separated from the society.  I never thought i would see a thread about being a Hikikomori in r/india but i would like to share my experience, so after i had given my ISC exam there was a long break in the duration before i appeared for JEE. So as usual during this time the pressure from my family to study to get a good collage was highest and also as i generally do not like to talk to people i got my full freedom to become a NEET like i didn't leave the floor i was on for 2 months and the experience was not very pleasant but liberating as I didn't have to face my family or so called friends.the duration of this was about 2-4 months but then collage happened and now i am rehabilitating into the society i still hate people and do not talk much but at least i am not a shut in now.  Pubground I stay indoors and enjoy my time alone.  Yep I do think Hikikomori is a thing in our country. I've been unemployed for a while now and the materialization of my ambitions hasn't happened yet, I'm studying hard and have confidence in myself but still I try to avoid socializing as much as possible, it just doesn't feel worth it. Exercising, junk food, netflix and studies is all I do and yet I do not feel as depressed as I should because even without achieving anything that matters in the real world, I have somehow accepted the fact that one day I will make something of myself. But I do fear the what-if scenarios where I couldn't do what I set out to do. The fear of failures is strong and we try to keep that fear locked in a box but the society keeps reminding you of that fear.  Now Hear my story I am a 25 year old  now, lets start when i was 18 year old, I was  a   ""Bindass type"" Guy but surrounded by wrong group of friends which they cheated on me thinking i am a ""Chutiya"", Friends used to take advantage of me so I liked a Girl but couldn't approach her and tell  that I like her but i didn't had that strength wasted 5 years of my life in that phase she went to Kerala for her medical career  and i left NIIT career course in mid way so couldn't complete it, was depressed and got lazy spending most of the time on the internet and playing video games,some times i had suicidal  thoughts but then i overcame it thinking its all a temporary feeling, I wanted to be a software developer after bcom completion in 2015 but i didn't had that motivational strength to do it and then i joined a company in 2016 and left it after 5 months due to pressure from seniors and for a period of 1 year i was mentally disturbed then in 2017 i joined a call center bpo worked for 5 months due to low salary and drug addicts and wrong crowd,i left the company on lunch break and for a period of 6 months i wasted  wandering what to do i wanted to go into software development but some astrologer told me that i will not have a career on technical field so didn't had that much motivation to do,later i went to  Kerala for a mid vacation and then  got a call from Accenture stating they wanna  hire me so i went for the interview in Mumbai for BPO process Insurance again not part of my interest and lot of pressure spent 8 months of working and later I Left it, then i watched a Documentry on Youtube of Hikkikomori people then i got to know thats what i am going through My career is totally fucked and crumbled now  i am fighting against my lethargy and trying all the best i can to get into Software development field. An insightful post after a long time on r/India. Thanks for sharing. [deleted] Too poor for that shit. Most men in India can't afford to sit only at home. They need to get out and work to get food. >many millions will, statistically, die alone.

Most people die alone. I don't know if it counts as half Hikikomori, but when I'm in engineering all I did is go to college and come to home. Sometimes I even didn't go to college for few weeks and stayed at home. 

I'm doing a job now. But it's same, office, home, zero interaction. 

I want to get rid of this habit but well still can't.  I came across this a while ago and quickly realized it is not just a Japanese phenomenon because I was able to relate to it so much. I quit three well paying jobs in past two years to stay at home and try to earn an income on my own, but haven't succeeded so far. Gave up soon and got a job the first two times, but now its been six months since I've been at home after quitting my last job. If only I can make a living by staying at home, I'll be a Hikikomori for life! :P Bro Idk what to do  Ive been a recluse myself for over 5 years.  Nah, Hakikomori completely different to what's happening in India. Indian job aspirants experience social isolation but they still have minimal interaction and goals, but it's nothing like being a NEET. Hikikomori is way too severe, like 5 years at average. Minimum 2 years to even consider yourself to be one. Also, there's Neetbux and money from their parents even at the age of 25-30, they also don't have any goals other than self pleasure, Indian parents rarely raise a 30 year old child. Hikikomori rarely get get out to the point that Agoraphobia. You can't compare Hikikomori to Indian isolation. Dont think Indian parents will let it get that bad. Take Indian social isolation and multiply it by 8000 times, then you get a hikikomori. Perhaps it had to do with the current job scenario in our country or may be not but I think it's a reflection of the educational system that focused too much on irrelevant things like IITJEE or leaving no other choice for students than Btech and such. Sad thing still being that parents are unable to accept the fact that engineering and related streams are saturated and its not a decision to be made by parents but rather its the teenager who should be capable enough to take a decision on their own.

And the work culture in India is starting to improve, at least in the IT world, with the start-ups popping up but it's gonna take a long time for those stubborn corporations to adapt to a better work environment.  It's very difficult to be a *hikikomori* in India because there are so many people and everybody wants to have something to do with you. Contrary to what you are saying, it's almost impossible to be forgotten because somebody will always ask about you or if they haven't seen you for a long time will just ask straight where you've been and what you're doing. Social isolation is probably the most difficult thing to achieve here. Being socially isolated assumes an individualist society which we haven't been able to build yet. For, me I am kind of a social recluse. But, not as bad as a Hikikomori as I have a job and I still go out to tea with my gang. I am trying to improve. Well done OP on putting forward a topic which is prevalent but isn't talked about much. It's just like several other problems which aren't considered as ""real"" problems in India. I feel it'll be a long time before Indians try solving it. They first need to recognize it as a problem.  Contrary to popular belief here, I think that the Indian culture that is rooted into me won't permit me to become a complete shut in not matter how low I fall. There is the added fear that parents would stop supporting altogether, not to mention the society pressure of doing something productive.

I do however agree that male loneliness is very much on the rise, but don't think that it will progress to the point where a considerable amount of people would become hikkis

[AskIndia] Need career advice from complete strangers.,12,b8u3xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b8u3xw/askindia_need_career_advice_from_complete/,15,"Hello, I am your typical engineer wanting to do an MBA.
As of now I have two years of workex, and an acceptance from a top 10 MBA college (1.6LPM Hojaega in a few years). My father however has his own project management consultancy, and is suggesting I join it.
I enjoy the consultancy bit, and the engineering part, but it doesn't pay as well as a Top MBA job would. So now I am confused, primarily because :
1. Dad's company = My company, plus staying at home (I've had loneliness induced anxiety before)  is a big thing.
2. MBA has a huge loan attached (25L+interest) which I need a lot of time to pay off.
3. Even if I stay home, I'll have to get some specialization in my field of engineering. So more padhai, along with work.
4. I can always work and make the consultancy bigger, expand it. 
5. From various people that I've talked to, once you're making good money, it's difficult to come back and start working for yourself. 

Tldr : Top 10 MBA college vs Baap ka kaam

Edit : Made it to a Top 5 college today.
Anybody else willing to help me make an informed decision?",toitsmort," There's really no way to answer your question. Some people  would tell you to join your father's company because they'd hate working for others. Others would recommend MBA since the financial security that comes with it is important to them (MBA grads can shift from one industry to another without significant loss in pay and hence can manage well during troubling economy and downturn in specific industries). People will answer with their personal biases.

For both the options, there's pretty much the same risks and payoffs involved. You can do mba, fail to get a good job, and then struggle to pay the loan, OR you can get a great placement in big firm and be set for life with steadily growing pay and job security. If you choose your father's company, you'd become like Bezos, or you'd end up bankrupt. There's no way anyone can predict what will happen. 

This is actually the sort of decision that you will need to decide for yourself after considering both financial aspects as well as whether you'd enjoy working in either of the two streams. if you don't mind, as a potential MBA aspirant, I'd like to ask you a couple of a questions. can i comment/dm? I would rather be paying 1.6Lpm than earning it.  There are multiple options you could explore. For instance, join your dad’s firm, explore relevant certifications ( you said project management so I’m guessing a PMP, PSM or ITIL would be relevant), build up experience and then explore a full time or executive mba a few years down the line. As I’m sure you know an mba is more to do with building key business skills rather than learning about finance or marketing topics. Plus whenever you take over your dad’s business a full time an MBA would also add credibility to your CV if you were to seek funding or scout for clients; and also use the alumni network for the same. 

Again- this is just one suggested approach.  >Dad's company = My company

Are you sure? How much authority or power will you get after joining your dad's company? Consider all these before making your decision.

I know a guy who decided to join his father's business after engineering. Later he discovered that he didn't actually had much authority because the dad was controlling everything. Moreover, he didn't get much salary because apparently everything was his in the future so why bother with salary.",AskIndia,2019-04-03 13:45:58

Technical Guruji. He reads out tech news from different websites like gadgets 360 etc daily and calls it his own research. His unboxing is like literally unboxing. That's it. He just pulls the phone out of the box and reads the specs. People go gaga over that shit.  I was going to say Hindi clickbait channels, but they are mostly harmless. The worst and the most dangerous ones are the fake news propaganda channels that cherrypick and/or distort news to push a certain narrative. Some of them even brazenly spread lies. They gain millions of views and their followers cite their videos as facts to support their thinking and/or arguments.

Carryminati is another one i dislike Technical guruji. There is nothing technical all he does is read news from internet and unbox. No review nothing . 
Next is that Nikhil guy who just posts some clicibait tittles.

[AskIndia][NP] Why do they talk in English in most Bollywood interviews?,18,atd17z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/atd17z/askindianp_why_do_they_talk_in_english_in_most/,44,,aguyfrominternet," Not for all of them, but for many of the stars, their everyday language of thinking and communication is English.

Many of the movie scripts are written in English, with English dialogue, and later translated to Hindi.  most of them are star kids from rich families, elite social circles and attended schools where they hung around kids from other uber rich families so English is like their first language. there is no denying that the rich prefer English over Hindi. It's a language everyone can speak with a good level of fluency, most urban people in India are 80% Westernized so English is actually the most natural language for us, I'm sure you're talking about Koffee, it's on Star World which is an English channel.  Because English would be easy to understand compared the Hindi and it's slangs atleast in Interview . In the movie we have the context and even if somewords go over my head it is OK . Recent example GullyBoy . I am not a native Hindi speaker and I watch some interview's time to time on Film Companion& FC South( Youtube ) when they were asked why all their content is in English they mentioned the same thing making it English gives wide range of Audience . 

And the Fact that some of the South Actors are from north/Foreign and some of the North Actors are from South / Foreign . It makes sense to have the interview in the Language everyone is comfortable in . Just like Rule #3 of r/India



 A lot of actresses can't even speak proper Hindi. Also, a lot of actors are looked down upon if they are hindi speaking. Apparently, it's a sign of non-urban upbringing. 

Also, these actors have a lot of insecurities that gets covered by language! Why not? English is spoken all over. Not everyone speaks hindi, English is the common thread amongst all our languages. Fortunately most in Tamil industry sticks to Tamil.  If the interviewer asks the question in English, it'd look silly if answered in Hindi and vice versa.  
English channels and portals would have the interviews in English generally and Hindi ones in Hindi.  Exceptions do happen though.   The obvious trivial answer is that they're mostly more comfortable with English than Hindi - that the language of thought is English.

That's obviously because the ""better"" schools in India are English-medium.

But I find a little amusing the objection to that, and the vilification of those whose English is better than their Hindi.

It makes SENSE for English to be the primary language of education, and I think it's atrocious that students from vernacular medium schools can get through 12+ years of education without enough functional English to survive college.  The purpose of language is communication. And for better or worse, the world has adopted English as the international language of communication.  You might say it's largely due to historical reasons of empire, but English is also a very flexible language, able to adapt new vocabularies very rapidly.  

You might say Bollywood is the Hindi film industry, so they should speak Hindi. But then Bollywood is in Maharashtra,  so shouldn't it all be Marathi? 
Should South Indian actors and technicians be disallowed from participation in Bollywood? Or should they have a Hindi language qualification for entry?

In a country like India, it makes perfect sense to use the only common language that connects all regions.  And Indian English is a legitimate dialect in its own right - we are not using the language of Imperialists really.

By that token, Hindi is certainly not a natural language of even the so-called ""Hindi Belt"". Hindi is a synthetic language, specifically created to standardize a lingua franca for the northern regions.

Indian English does the same for the whole nation. People from South India follow the lives of these celebrities too. Speaking in Hindi would alienate an entire region. “Aaj mai kar ke aaya hai” Why do some of them talk in hindi?  Isn't India basically English speaking? I mean it's the de facto common language  Kahe ki speaking ingles makes you look educated and upmarket. You can't afford to be a bollywood bigwig and speak like a dehati, not with the world watching you. Might sound crude when spoken out loud like this, but it's true.",AskIndia,2019-02-22 12:27:13

[AskIndia] Situation with parents - Am I wrong?,58,as8cj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/as8cj5/askindia_situation_with_parents_am_i_wrong/,43,"27/M/Mumbai/Single/Only Son. Working a decent corporate job. I make \~14LPA. My parents are now retired. I've lived with them my whole life.

&#x200B;

I've had a good upbringing but my main problem has been that throughout my life, my family has been a group of over-thinkers, which has caused anxiety in me (and I'm sure in them) over things like ""What will you do?"" ""What if this?"" ""What if that?"" in every social, career, relationship position possible.

&#x200B;

Till they were working, this was fine, but ever since they've retired, they are finding it tough to deal with such situations. They have a good networth, we own 3 properties (live in 1, rented 1), they have a good corpus in the bank and they've invested money in good mediums. We are debt free. They feel they will run out of money, inflation will eat them up, they won't have food in their old age etc. This leads to fights daily among my parents and I am in the middle of the it playing the referee. In their fights, they demean each other calling out each other's weaknesses and failed ambitions in life. I felt this would happen a few days after retirement, but it's almost been a year now and it's non-stop.

&#x200B;

I do contribute to the house here and there but I feel that it'll hurt my father's ego if I start paying for household expenses. My father restricts a lot of travel to other cities citing expenses. My mom tells me in her fits of anger to ""pay"" for her to travel to other cities. I have volunteered but never followed through cause they never decided to go anywhere. **Are they waiting for me to take initiative / is their ego stopping them from asking / will I hurt their ego by paying?**

My mom has to feel in control of the house. With the timings of the maid to the food brought into the house. Even on the ocassions that my parents are back in their village for a week or two  - it's non stop. She cannot let go of things. **Does she feel she will lose control of the house if I take care of things?**

&#x200B;

There's a fight every second week over something or the other and the parents are not on talking terms for days. They had one today morning as I came to office. **Is this normal?**

&#x200B;

Now, this is leading me to a situation where I am :

1. Worried to make any big spends of my own and having the independence to do so - be it a trip with my friends, maybe a property on my name etc. How do I tackle this when it comes up? I don't want to be in a situation where my mom is like ""we aren't taking that train trip but you are going on joytrips with your friends?""
2. If I get married and live with my parents (Which my mom pretty much expects me to) will this be a conducive situation to start off my married life?  Specially with their fighting and all. How do I draw the line and be clear without hurting their feelings?
3. Has anyone moved out of their parents' house with some level of resentment (before or after marriage) and kept good cordial terms with their parents?
4. I feel a bit burdened and tied down in my house cause of few of the things here and otherwise. I am not always the happiest person when I get back home and look forward to office even though it's dull at times. Is this normal?
5. I have thoughts of getting a new job in another city and moving there alone and starting afresh (easier to change cities than get another house in the city). Is this okay? Does this make me a horrible child for abandoning 60 year old parents at home after retirement?

&#x200B;

Any other general pointers would be appreciated. Thanks in Advance.

Troubled, Yellow!

&#x200B;

TL;DR : 27M,Single, Live with parents in Mumbai. Parents keep fighting. Are controlling. Have big egos. Considering options in life without hurting them.

&#x200B;

Edit 1 : Added TL;DR",yellowledbetter07," Upvoted for visibility.

I feel the same situation will arise in home after I get a decent job given your mom and my mom's share similar traits.

Hope you find a good way to dissolve things, OP! Good luck! General advice: It may sound selfish . But then this is the time to be selfish. 10 years down the line you will be in their shoes and not young enough to follow your dreams.

Step 1: threaten to leave if they don’t mend their ways. 

Step 2: if they don’t change then actually leave. Take a job outside. Once you are gone they ll realise your importance. A little bit of distance helps. Unless they realise your importance they won’t hear you.

Step 3: move back and make them move with you once things are normal and you feel they are ready to listen and change.

There is no point wasting your life trying to convince them when in their eyes their ego is bigger than peace of family and your career. Same story at my house too. This problem isn't something that appeared one day, this problem existed long time back since you were a child. Now trying to change it won't help much. Maybe they'll understand you are not liking it and will stay silent in front of you. But once your back is turned, it will start again.

&#x200B;

For now, I suggest you stay at distance from them. Rent a house bit away or else buy one. Because whatever the matter is you shouldn't let daughter of someone else suffer it after marriage. Plus, it will give time to your parents to adjust to your absence rather than it suddenly happening after marriage.

&#x200B;

Regarding 5th point, I did it. Moved to Pune from Mumbai, refreshed life. Now I have my own place, I got married. My parents visit us once in awhile, we visit them once in a while. But I am sure my wife wouldn't have been able to survive them. It's not abandonment, you can always bring them to your home when age catches up and they actually need you. But till they are capable of handling themselves, let them do it. I can empathize with your parents. In most middle class Indian households, financial security is the biggest concern. I imagine your parents would have experienced some sort of financial strife in their life, which has made them this way.

So what to do? You have to ensure that you convey your respect to them. You volunteer to undertake some minor expenses... nay, you undertake some minor expenses like paying for cooking gas/groceries/telephone/internet etc. 

Keep pitching in, but also ensure that you have some sort of financial independence. Keep taking those trips with your friends... you're not obliged to take permission of your parents, but it's good to keep them informed.

 salary ctc hai ya net?

i had a friend in your situation, he set up a yoga center and put his parents in charge, now he makes money and his parents are busy with things they like to do and be in company of people of their age.  1. Find a job in another city and move out as soon as you can. You are not getting younger. You deserve to experience other things in life, this is not going to get better and you need time for other things. You can and should keep in touch with them 

2. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT, get married and live with your parents. Anywhere. Tell your wife about the situation and how you handle it and what she should ignore when things go south. Spend time in nurturing relationship with your wife. She should never feel that your parents control your actions. And they should not. 

3. Make sure your parents have resources in their old age, give sincere advice, be forceful while making logical arguments if needed, don't break relations, you can restrict the time you spend on them without making them feel helpless. Beyond that you don't need to do anything. Bhaad mein Gaye log kya kahenge. 

Be sincere to yourself and be confident.  Your parents might be doing this all the time because they might have nothing else to do. This may sound stupid but this happens all the time especially with retired people. You're now the man of the house. Act like you are. Talk to them firmly. Tell them if they don't stop arguing you will either move out, put them in a nursing home or in therapy. Tell them it's affecting you as well. 

Before doing this. 
Make sure you Go to Kesari, Veena world or Thomas cook with your parents. Show them the catalogs then let them choose. Make sure you take every aspect like weather conditions, clothing, no. Of days, etc. In consideration. Even after that they're not able to decide you decide it for them. If after the trip they don't change the behaviour then go for the first option. If possible,I would suggest trying to take your parents out of India. Somewhere not too costly like Singapore or Malaysia or even UAE. This way you and your father both can contribute. And make sure you go with them.  Hey Yellow, I think you already have answers to all your questions in your head but you need someone else to tell them to you. 


Well I hope this helps, I moved out of my house as soon as I got my current job, lived in same/different cities. Fast forward 6 years, right now living with wife and kid. Parents happy and content as we keep visiting them. Thankful to God ,my parents are not very fussy (old age problems yet to kick in) and keeping fit as of now.

Further,  I know it sounds very kiddish that,  there can be only one alpha male in the house, but it actually holds true specially with retired parents.

 Parents either one of them will not like you taking life decisions that too involving any kind of money and if they're not involved in decision making process they will feel and this will bug them continously. 

So be bold, make the move, take care. Control freak parents are the norm in India. If you are earning enough to take care of yourself and contribute to their well-being as well, then do as you please with your money.

Do try to spend it responsibly though, and one way is to invest a part of your income to support your long term needs. That way if theyfreak out or shame you for your expenditure, you have proof to make them STFU.

Oh, and you should stop being an intermediary when they fight. Things will eventually reach am equilibrium.

Also, just tell them that you are grown up, intend to take care of them when they are incapable, so they should not worry too much about money, within reason. Tell them to enjoy their post-retirement life doing some of the things they didn't while taking care of you.

If that does not work, tell them you will move out for your mental peace, if they can't resolve their differences like sensible adults. They have been together for 30 years and ought to know each other well by now. I am also the only child (son) and it sucks. The whole world is on your shoulders!!!  Send them for a short vacation or pilgrimage. This may sound stupid but they seem bored and worried thinking just about the future. Ask them if they really are debt free and don't have any hidden expense that they are worried about. One solution is to get one of them (the healthier one probably) something to do, like a cozy business. Doesn't need to be successful. Most people can't stand to be in close quarters with another 24x7. Especially those with arranged marriages and full time jobs.

It will be awkward to suggest though. You could phrase it like a favour to you, and the business could also be something you might want to grow down the line. One suggestion, I am not sure how it will be implemented but try to go to counselling first alone and then with parents. It helps to clear out your mind and chart a path for the future. But be aware it might give you answers which you didn't expect, but it helps. Upvoting for  visibility. ",AskIndia,2019-02-19 16:53:46

"[AskIndia] I speak modern hindi. Hypothetically, how far could I travel back in time and still be able to have a meaningful conversation with a hindi/hindustani speaker?",109,apdunu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/apdunu/askindia_i_speak_modern_hindi_hypothetically_how/,23,,ajaiswal07," inspired by a similar question on /r/AskHistorians Amateur linguistics enthusiast here.

After late 1700s-early 1800s, you could get yourself understood comfortably over large swathes of Northern India. Language was largely standardised in northern India at that point due to the influence of the British and more so, as they increased their influence and for administrative efficiency. 

And before that, inter-intelligibility of your spoken language would largely depend on the region you're in.  
If you spoke in standard sanskritised shudh hindi, you could've gotten by with reasonable comfort in eastern UP/bihar region. Linguists call this the Awadhi dialect. 
If you spoke in persianised hindi, with loanwords of persian origin, you could've got yourself understood in western UP, NCR, parts of Haryana and Rajasthan. There used to be a separate dialect called Brajbhasha spoken in these parts too, the language in which Meerabai wrote her poems.

So comfortably, let's say you could've made it work until about early 1600s.

In fact, hindi grammar wasn't even standardised until 1954. Even if the other speaker understands what you are saying, he/she might still be surprised by your use of vocabulary. Hindi then (Hindustani) generally had a higher percentage of Urdu than it has now. Modern Hindi contains a lot of words that probably didn't exist in the past. So hypothetically if you travel back in time you won't be going too far, probably 17th-18th century at most during the later stages of Mughal era or starting of the British Raj. Modern Hindi also relies heavily on English words. I doubt the generation of our great-grandparents would understand a lot of words we use today. I think transportation was a lot limited then and in general culture exchange between places too. Local languages had more space to develop especially in rural places. Hindustani would be restricted to imperial cities, and merchants because it provides a common medium. Rural areas didn't need it and probably didn't bother to learn Hindi.

Hindi itself differs area to area vocabulary wise today.  you should ask how many kilometers you can drive from your home & still be understood by ""hindi speaking"" people. I guess around 1200 CE the time of the Delhi Sultanate. 

But to some extent the Gupta empire 500 CE may also retain some form of the language but I think that would be highly unlikely.

Edit: BCE - CE You could manage talking to people till 12th century.
You can manage upto 1st and 2nd century with South Indian languages.  [deleted] There are two hindis? Which one are you going to make it the national language? How high are you? ",AskIndia,2019-02-11 15:25:37

",deshGandu," Screw you. it's the subreddit creator's wish whether he likes to keep it open or not. you can politely ask him to keep it open, if he doesn't there's nothing you can do about it because it's his right to do anything with it.  Okay. Time to make /r/IndianEconomy closed and moderated.

Why are you people cribbing about other subreddits, which are not even in use? If you have a problem, please create a new one. Now I think you're being downright offensive. Really? Is this even a battle? Tomorrow if I go and create a private subreddit for my own purposes, will I have to open that up too, just because some Gandu is waging a battle on /r/india? Here's the story about askindia. Schar started it ages back. Back when the /r/india mods wanted to plan for extension/niche subs, I asked schar if I could be added for that purpose. For then, the sub was left fallow. A few weeks ago (2 or so I think) badshaah asked to take over and reactivate it. He was modded and given free reign. When people didn't participate, he threw a shitfit, nuked the sub and demodded himself. Here's the [modlog](http://i.imgur.com/Upd4T.png). He even re-titled it ""bullshit subreddit"". So I'm willing to open it back up, as long as I get at least one person who is willing to mod it. And run it as you see fit, as long as you follow the rules of reddit. I might not respond today; I'm coordinating travel plans for a funeral, but reply to me if you want the job. Those supported the most by comments and upvotes (and known not to be rabble-rousing trolls) will be given an equal opportunity. I may consult with other people as to who to mod. from: poop_monster
>Also a few of the other mods have said that /r/indianpolitics will be opened up now since the community seems to want it. 

They are under impression that they own indian community on reddit. They register a new sub every 10 mins i think.

I was reading [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4rtch/what_are_the_reasons_given_by_indian_government/ej91j9w/?context=9) and was thinking what laws you think were reactionary and make no sense in the long term but were enacted nevertheless. 

Lets not limit this to just bans

Off the bat from that thread. 

1. Window tints on cars [Incident ??]
2. Porn ban [Incident ??]

Also mention why the rule was enacted, based on which incident",tHeSiD," 1. Intercaste marriage rule is the dumbest and archaic of them all. 

After notifying the registrars office, couples details including picture is put on a notice board for 30 days and a letter to their residential addresses. 

Not sure why it is enacted. 

Edit:

2. We live in India, yet you can't drive a vehicle registered in a different state for more than 6 months. why can't they centralise the transportation department?

3. Mobile network - roaming charges if you don't have a special recharge. I can only think this is to make more money. 

I would very much like to know why the RTO isn't centralised and IC marriage rule in enacted.  Pubg ban that May happen soon... Idk why Indians moms worry so much its not the games mistake that their kids play it 24x7 so instead of identifying the cause why your kid is playing so much Pubg or any other gane for that fact  they will just blame the game and say its Ruining my kids life ; your kid will anyway end up finding some other game or some other thing that he/she will end up getting addicted to something else and go on the wrong path if the real underlying problem is not solved  >Window tints on cars [Incident ??]   
    
I remember it was enacted to avoid vehicle borne kidnapping incidents. Atleast that's what the news channels were talking about then.

4. how to choose depends on your priorities.

5. I would say vote for NOTA only if you decide that the candidates in your area really really suck. eg- they are criminals or known to be corrupt etc. Otherwise lesser evil.  make up your mind whom to vote and rest will be done by party workers of your local booth. 

those workers will even provide you that voter slip, which will be used for casting your vote, a day or two before voting takes place. *Also how do I choose which candidate to vote* ?

My question is, is it supposed to be this way or did the authority here took steps to do this little thing. ",Jumpingonacloud," Censorship is so f****** stupid. They censored pussy from pussycat in Bohemian rhapsody. Watching international movies in cinemas in India is pointless. I remember watching Deadpool and they butchered that movie so hard with shitty edits like this that I vowed never to watch any English-language movie in cinemas ever again while in India.


Just wait for it come to a streaming service. Woh chodo bhai. Why netionel Anthem before movie. Mein kya Sarhad ko ja raha hoon? Yes it was very weird watching that movie with all the cuts I was so friggin triggered in the cinema watching all these nonsense cuts.

Keep fucking hand or handkerchief while sneezing/yawning [deleted] Don't play music/videos loudly in public places  Don't get your kids/toddlers/babies to cinema halls if you know they're going to cry. It spoils everyone's experience in the theatre. 

Also since I'm talking about theatres. If you're one of those people who crack jokes loudly in theatres, especially in Horror/Thriller movies. Please don't do that. People paid to watch the movie, not you. Be on time. I cannot tell you how many times I've been to some place only to wait for an hour because the person I was supposed to meet was only ""5 minutes away"". The whole ""I'm like that only. You should get used to it"" crap doesn't work. It's dishonest and disrespectful. If you say you'll be there at 4 pm, be there at 3.55 pm.  If you’re using things belonging to someone else or are in someone else’s home, please don’t disturb the general system and respect their belongings. 

Hate the people who leave their traces of being irresponsible guests.  Not sure if this is an etiquette but here : If someone says no to you for anything you ask, you shouldn't ask them to explain themselves.  Be civil.  Always use headphones before playing a voice message/video (like WhatsApp) from friends while others are around. Kya pata kamino ne kya bheja ho! Be considerate, don't be impatient. Use tit for two tat strategy for almost everything.

Many manners/etiquettes can be derived from these simple rules.

 There's absolutely no reason to ask a person about their lives or tell them how they should be doing something unless they're your SO or you're their supervisor in a professional setting. I've lost count how many times I've had to blatantly tell this to others and sometimes even say it out loud in public to embarrass them on purpose just so they give up doing that. Forming queue at any counter Chill the fuck out in traffic. Even with all your antics on road, you will only save a minute or two reach.  We Indian eat spices a lot resulting in bad body odour. 

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, please put on deo / spray when you go out. 

Also keep checking bad mouth odour and find some remedy which works best for you. For me, I keep some saunf at my desk and chew it once in a while.  Respect privacy.

 I feel like there should be a dedicated 24*7 channel to teach basic human etiquette to the people. Rich people, poor people all behave like animals in certain situations. First of all there's a concept of queue, second when there is ample space to stand comfortably then why the hell people shove their groins into the arse of man in front.

Then there's privacy issue at home, at work, at commute. List goes on and on.  Always excuse yourselves when you belch loudly infront of others.  It's rude to stare Always use blinker while u turn. Please, sorry and thank you go a long way. Sadly, many Indians think of it as just a British import.  Let the passenger get off from the delhi metro and then board.
 As a non smoker * Don't fucking smoke in the public areas. If you do so make sure smoke fumes do not effect the other people by maintaining some distance. You are not only damaging your lungs but surrounding peoples as well. * DON'T PEEK into other's phone. Repay your debt (small or midsized ones) on committed time/date. Or at least have a very good reason for further delay. Don't be obvious by showing off a new phone in front of the creditor at least, or have a fancy restaurant dinner and post it on Facebook. Somewhat related, but apparently it is acceptable to blow your nose in public? I’ve seen a few Americans/ Canadians do this while I was working with them. 
I never do this, I always wait when I am alone or go to the bathroom... What you have written is not etiquette, it is principle and shows character and security.

All these seem like classic cases of clinical depression (of course, my knowledge is only limited to what I have read). So get professional help.

[Go through this link](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/detecting-depression) and see if it fits you. DO NOT fall for confirmation bias; that is don't force fit the symptoms to that of yours. Be extremely critical with the signs and scrutinize your past actions.

Some questions could be:

1. Are you demotivated a lot? Do you feel blank most of the times? 

2. Have you stopped doing something that you loved doing before?

There is nothing wrong in seeking professional help for this. Consult with a psychiatrist and get yourself diagnosed. And if you're diagnosed with something it could change your life and improve it. There are many such success stories out in the real world.

Okay for starters it's really difficult to learn this because there are no fucking proper courses or teachers and yes u will find a lot of proof of work concepts rather than legit products. It's a developing technology so yes it will be hard to learn about it.

Having said all that Blockchain still has potential because the big four accounting firms believe its potential for transactional and insurance purposes are way more secure than traditional systems.

Try learning about the R3Corda network. Many companies are trying to have a centralized version of a decentralised network verified by a ledger.

Also learn about the actual Blockchain core part rather than the crypto currency gimmick. I implemented a simple blockchain in Java a while ago. Sadly, not a lot of resources available to learn from:/",AskIndia,2019-03-22 09:59:07
[AskIndia] What 'Indian' habits do find the most annoying?,111,9hf3pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9hf3pd/askindia_what_indian_habits_do_find_the_most/,380,As the title says. ,Expressionlesslaugh," Vehicles being ridden on high-beam by default. Not to mention, the unnecessary honking. Not knowing how queue works. Indian driving. Zero lane discipline. Zero traffic rule compliance. Swearing. Honking. Honking by swearing. Utter impatience while driving. 
Lack of civic sense in general .  We are the worst at workplaces. Everyone is a yaar and bhai, and kar dena dost. We don't value people's life outside of office and also on holidays and weekends, so we call them up and expect them to work. 

Other things aside, I feel that our behaviour at workplaces is the worst. Not minding one's own business . We are experts in that .  Keeping their speaker volume up to let everyone know of their shit music tastes. Bonus cringe points when Indians do this outside India. Spitting that paan shit everywhere. Writing their names and their eternal love on walls, usually monuments or old buildings. Bitching about others religions. Not following traffic rules AT ALL. Asking how much others kids scored.  People bragging about our ancestors' achievements. Especially when something nice happens somewhere else. Oh, our ancestors knew/did that a million years ago.  Uploading stupid songs as WhatsApp status Not respecting someone else's personal space. Not minding their own business. Random Relatives calling my parents to enquire about my marks, results and achievements everytime. To try and compare with their son's/daughter's achievements and satisfy their fragile ego if i ""underachieved"" comparatively.  confusing physical appearance with personality 1. Complete strangers and even acquaintances  2 mins into the conversation asking how much I earn. 

2. Hoardings for politicians, weddings, celebrities, birthday's, deceased for anything and everything. Just blindly worshipping idiots. They put it right in the corner. Had a guy fly over the bonnet of my car as we couldn't see each other.  [deleted] Taking great pride in backwardness/regressive attitudes and calling it 'culture'.

If Sanskar is an excuse to mistreat a fellow human, then to hell with sanskar. Throw that baby out with the bathwater.
 Giving up on people if they don’t do well in school... How everyone here prefer fair skin over dark.  IT'S NOT A FUCKING CHOICE! When my grandma complimented me for my fair skin, I literally explained her nothing is wrong with being dark but I know it wont change her attitude. Also actors who do Fair and Lovely ads makes my blood boil, fuck them! Giving too much importance to celebrities. They are just humans ffs. People treat them like god, ignore their own families just to get one glimpse of celebrity and even kill the self if the celebrity dies. Driving your vehicle at insane speeds and recklessness, only to reach your destination and do nothing but jacksh*t. Randomly spitting on the streets for no fucking reason.  [deleted] Refusing to embrace the technological wonder known as deodorant.  Person 1:Buys a commodity for XXXX rupees

Person 2: Bhai mujhe bolta XXXX-1 mein dilwaadeta Driving on the opposite lane because your lane is full of traffic. Thus creating an illegal one way of sorts. I am doing business from past 3 years.
Mostly with international clients. Reasons reasons... Keep reading.
My startup is a service based IT company. To make good portfolio, I took a seat in a co-working space and immediately started getting business because of my 110% dedication, 'under commit and over deliver' stand and a kinda less profit margin. 
Now comes the problem.

- They are never clear what they want. Everyday a new requirement. 
- Their hand never reach their pockets, never. Never ever!
- They are never satisfied
- They come up with rs.5k budget to make new Flipkart and Amazon

Was in IT service, so no investment other than co-working space monthly billing.
So no loss but almost no profit. 
But i made a huge portfolio and shifted my client base to US, UK and Nordic market.

Perfect people. They know what they want. Give them a date and the payment is in your account. They give what they promise if they bargain (i am not having that much budget but i promise you 5 clients after this project, and the person came up with 5 clients in next 2 months) 
Indians never. They say this and they forget. They don't respect words!


After some time, I thought the time is different, the market is booming, the people have changed. So i took 3 new Indian clients.
Guess what! 
History repeated itself. I have only 3 clients who have not paid the money. Guess who are they?

Tldr,
Indians don't pay money even for the service they have taken! Spitting. Parking cars on turns. Pissing all over the place in western style toilets.  Littering EVERYWHERE.

Making groups in public and being noisy and nuisances. 2 wheeler drivers cutting cars to go ahead and then brake hard. Idiots! ""Kahan naukri kar rahe ho beta""            
""xyz industry mein hoon Abc company mein""               
""Aaj kal xyz industry aur chal nhi rhi""

 I don't know if this fits but a person working in a different country is considered far more successful than people staying here and making it big. This might seem snooty.
But our behaviour on Flights.

Fucking Hell , we always ensure that Air Hostess folk have to keep on checking if the seat is upright and window is raised .
Then seatbelts ..
It's not that hard...
Atleast wear it loose when you're on the seat.


Then After Landing , Getting up almost immediately and Opening Overhead Bins.
In all these scenarios ,you're more likely to hurt another person than yourself.
Which is exactly why you keep doing it.


Last but not least, our priorities.
Couple of years ago ,an Emirates Flight from Thiruvananthapuram to Dubai crash landed at the Dubai International Airport.
The Firefighters at the Airport managed to evacuate the Entire Flight in less than 90 seconds.
Even after the Crash Landing , people tried to take their laptops and Hand Baggage.
They opened emergency Exits at this point.

There's a reason why it's open.
Because the Fucking Fuel Tanks might explode.
And in this scenario , it did and resulted in the Death of an Emarati Firefighter.


A lot of Foreign flying crew were repeatedly saying this is the attitude of all Indians.
I'm not one to exactly accept stereotypes but FFS it's so hard to negate the argument.

Recently , I had a fucking similar experience .
Moron opens overhead bin while flight is on the taxiway after landing and bag which has moved falls down luckily hitting the seat and not directly onto a passenger.



This pisses me off every fucking time. Driving habits on the road. Just bought a new car, 2 hours after delivery of car, one auto-wallah brushed it from the rear when the car was at halt at signal. Scratches all over rear bumper. The dirty habit of staring at any and everyone anywhere they go. Indians in the US also do this. Makes me want to punch their face! Peeking into some one else’s phone while travelling via public transport. I swear the number of times I’ve seen people trying to peep into my WhatsApp. And every time I catch them I shove the phone in their face saying “acche se dekhke.” 

Also old uncles playing WhatsApp videos loudly. So fucking annoying. 

Autos stopping smack in the middle of the road when someone hails them down. 

Literally nobody uses an indicator while turning.

Open mouthed gawking. I’m 6’3 tall, have tattoos and a ponytail. I feel like I’m always being watched by at least 10 people at once. 

Neighbours rushing to peep from their door when they hear the sound of the elevator opening on to their floor. 

Standing, walking in the middle of a narrow road blocking vehicles and not budging even after excessive honking. 

 Staring. eating with mouth open or making noise. Burrping [removed] Digging nose in public

And not washing hands after Carrying a speaker with loud noise when u are in public place.
Judging people by their English.
Not following traffic rules( especially not allowing pedestrians to cross the road when the signal is red and bypassing it).
Forget abt Aeroplane commuters, they never heard abt something queue. They are in hurry to receive the Olympic medal for getting down the plane in the fastest time. Politicians and their bootlicking entourage. The entire big shot politician culture where we treat a regular Corporator like an MP. 

Putting up of unnecessary hoardings by unemployed, unproductive youth and also the same youth indulging in making a street pub in the name of festivals by hiring fuckall DJ's to blast fuckall songs and deafen each living being in a 5 km radius. Ogling at woman! Imposing your religious and cultural beliefs on others and judging them when they don't follow it.  Thread padhte hi BP high ho gaya. Need to head out for a walk. Public me thookna. It's so cringey. Asking if there is salt in my toothpaste.. Imma bite yo face, bitch.

 Talking loudly in public. Staring. Long, languorous, staring. Not just roadside romeos but everyone when they encounter something they don't see everyday. You want to walk in my field of vision? Let me escort you through it with my eyes  ""log kya kahenge"" Slurping coffee during meetings.  Lane cutting. Man, seriously the single most absolute worst thing Indians to is change lanes too frequently, especially the autowallahs.  Unsolicited opinions.  Being loud on phone in public and taking long breaks at work.  Indians argue a lot and rarely admit that they are wrong. Man, start saying No dont nod your head for everything  Aggressive self loathing to no positive outcome. I'm also guilty of it. caring more about someone else's job rather than focusing on your own. Not following lane discipline.

Not using blinkers.

Not turning headlights to low beam.

Driving like morons. 

Parking like bigger morons. 

Spitting that awful red paste.

Throwing trash EVERYWHERE.

Smashing coconuts and melons outside temples and not cleaning it up.

No interest in keeping things clean. 

Caste system (which to my surprise is still quite prevelent)

Carving their names (and their SO's) into priceless monuments and war memorials

SPITTING THAT AWFUL RED PASTE. 

.. Honestly I could go on..  Freeloading even when there is no urgency i have pretty bad OCD, i wash my hands every now and then....it boggles me when in my office toilet when people never wash hands after peeing, i am like dude stay away....and i dont know how to tell them to wash hands...and also when people move stuff from my desk, i cry within. :( All of them. No concept of personal space. Chipak jaao. Farting openly in public as if no one notices. Die hard fan of Mudi gyan chodna BKL log jo hath dikha ke road cross Kar dete hai.

## What 'Indian' habits do *you* find the most annoying?

&#x200B; Retarded idiots who do social policing, the idiots with stupid petitions against Netflix, Amazon and the kulcha gank Haggling over everything and shitting in the streets Those damn soap operas. They are transmitting a lot of crazy upon people. Treating servants and office peons like shit. And sucking up to superiors. People on two wheelers try to drive through any tiny space they see. Doesn't matter if it a car or a truck. And many times the truck drivers can't see them because they're so close and the driver is sitting so high. And they get run over by the truck. Last night two people (a father and his daughter) died the same way at a road near my home.  Slowpokes driving on the right side of main roads @ 20 kmph in their ₹.100 vehicles. I'm gonna run you over assholes. Paan and gutka. Just stop. Take up smoking please. I can't stand those red stains on walls. [removed] Eat beta eat  the so called ""Democracy"" ""beta engineering/medical karlo uske baad jo maan wo karna"" Life is like two pea's in a pod.  One annoys the other.

We all annoy, natural talent.  This entire post is triggering my anxiety. I need an adult. Honking unnecessarily on roads Talking (actually screaming) on the top of their lungs to converse with each other in restaurants, public places. 


Uncles sharing their daily morning rituals ""Bhai hum to subha uthate hi do glass garam paani peete hain, aur bus pet saaf (they would never say they finish of packs of khaini jarda after that)"" Aunties Gossiping. Lol  Parking. They don't give two shits about how the bike parked ahead comes out if you park yours horizontally. People driving while talking on the phone or while listening music on earphones..  Celebrating mediocrity.  Meddling in other people's business.  My father and his elder brother ask for my friends' ""Caste"" saying ""Kaun Thakur hai""? Using at least 10 emojis in a sentence. 

Always clarifying that they're Indian in social media platforms. Come on bro, there is no big fucking deal in being born in a country with 1.3 billion people. Spitting anywhere! Oh so many, where do I start...

1. Signing at the entrance of apts... I dont know if the register has really ever been reviewed.
2. Full body search at expensive cinemas
3. Asking for self attested photocopies, has the signature helped in prosecuting someone or really ensured you dont get fakes?

&#x200B; People who just complaint and don't do shit Dealing with Mohras. Example, you close a deal with one person. He discusses it with his family. The head honcho insists he revise it. Shows up the next day saying HE wants a revision.

A variant of this habit is found in personal relationships, where intimacy is killed because the spouse or lover makes a third party, usually family, a secret party to all relationship details.

Another variant of this habit is found in romances, where the recieving party instead of building a relationship immediately divulges details to dominating  frands to secure bragging rights, sometimes even bringing them along just to prove to THEM. Adding to the constant honking, people driving with their side view mirrors shut annoy me alot. Also rickshaw and Ola drivers just going top speed moment they see an empty space.

[AskIndia] My passport renewal application got flagged for RPO inquiry because I missed the police verification 10 years back. What problems that I am looking at?,63,aoq0pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aoq0pr/askindia_my_passport_renewal_application_got/,16,"I got my passport on tatkal 10 years back. But before the police verification could be done I had to fly abroad. We did not have the verification after I returned back to India and eventually I completely forgot about it. I also never saw any notice being sent to me about this. I traveled multiple times in the last 10 years but never had an issue at the immigration desk at airport.

Few days back I went for renewal with no address or name change. It seems it got flagged because of the verification issue and now I have to visit RPO next month.

What kind of issues that I might face? How do I prepare for this inquiry? Is there a possibility that my passport may be denied? ",blrbud," Doubt anything serious will happen. You perhaps will have to do a fresh police verification this time. 

Source : My ass, but that's the most likely scenario. Something similar had happened to me. It wasn't a big problem, I had to give a letter stating that due to some personal exigency I couldn't get verification done last time, kind of like an apology letter and they said that passport this time will only be issued after verification is completed. I had to wait like 10 days to get the passport.  Don't know what will happen but be very polite to the officers there even if they annoy you. Had same thing. I was apparently issued regular passport without police verification and it was caught during the final step of the renewal application process. 

The officer who reviewed the application asked to write a letter about my whereabouts for last 10 years and asked me to get a sign from the Assistant Passport Officer who was the head of that PSK and get it scanned and added to my file from a TCS employee. I went in to APO's office and explained the situation, he signed the letter without any further questions and asked me to explain to police the same thing if they ask about it. The police didn't ask during verification and I was issued passport just fine. take a good lube when u go to the RPO next month. one never knows. Passport office have some very senior and honest people. personal experience with New Delhi passport office, just be polite and don't try to use jugaad. Since sushma swaraj, passport is taken very seriously, so keep your paper in order and be present there.  Fresh police verification will happen. This has happened with me too. I got a letter from RPO and it appeared to have a mild threat that my passport may be revoked if my police verification isn't done. I had to visit RPO and get a new verification initiated for myself. 
I had to write apology letter something (those people with type writer outside RPO took 100 rs or so and wrote it). Take enough money with you to pay a fine if they impose one. Should be a couple of thousand atleast.  Show them a couple of pink notes. It'll get the job done. /s",AskIndia,2019-02-09 14:58:23
[AskIndia] Do I breakup with a generic reason or tell my boyfriend that I'm dying?,261,9vkdtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9vkdtp/askindia_do_i_breakup_with_a_generic_reason_or/,105,"I have been in a perfect relationship of 2 and a half years. Both of us are about 26 years old now and it was our first relationship. For the past couple of months, we've been in long distance.
 
I recently found out that I have breast cancer and there's not much hope.
 
Everywhere I look for advice on whether or not to share this truth, people suggest to tell the truth and while I agree with them, I think that the case here is different.
 
My boyfriend always wanted to do a love marriage and if I tell him the truth, he will stick around and might not be able to get over me. Since here in India, almost everyone gets married by their late 20s, I don't want to take away his time of finding someone new. 
 
Although it'll be painful for me to break up with him making him feel like he didn't matter much to me, I still might be able to pull off a reason like I want to settle abroad, I won't be able to oppose my family etc.",randomuser2k," Why do you want to have your boyfriend find out after your are dead, it's fucking unfair to him. Tell him the truth, if he loves you he will understand. Don't be mean with his heart. But do understand he may also walk the other direction.  Tell him the truth. It's the respectful thing to do. Tell him the truth. 

>I still might be able to pull off a reason like I want to settle abroad, I won't be able to oppose my family etc.

Made up reasons might help you but will cause more pain and for both.

I hope you find a way out of your misery and things get better for you guys :) I am so sorry. Are you sure your cancer is terminal? I mean Im sure you have probably taken multiple opinions since its such a serious matter. I have seen Tata memorial hospital in Mumbai to be a really good oncology centre. There are insane amounts of people from all over the country who visit there. If you havent taken multiple opinions, I would recommend to take an opinion there.  We all have just one life. Better to tell the truth and go on from there and see what happens. Tell him.  I'm very very sorry to hear about your illness. Stay strong.  Also, telling him the truth would be the best thing to do. When in love, both of you are not different people but one. Tell him.

I sincerely hope that you recover. Godspeed. here's the thing u/randomuser2k: No matter what disease you have, and what circumstances you are going through, NEVER GIVE UP HOPE! Even if you have a disease that threatens your life, you still have ""some"" time! Let it be a day, a month, a year... doesn't matter! Spend time with each other, even if you are sick. Give him a chance to know the truth. If he really loves you, he will respect you and honour your wishes. I don't know your SO, and hence I can't comment on what might happen; but whatever happens, be it positive or negative, be honest. Lying will only be negative for both of you! Don't lose hope love. Breast cancer has high survival rates. Tell him the truth. This way you both can enjoy the time you have together. It may not end well and you may not get the perfect goodbye, but it will be fair to him as he will walk forward knowing everything. As for you, my depest sympathies. I hope for a miracle and hope you can survive for your full life.  Tell him the truth  :) Let’s be reasonable here. Whether you tell him or not, he will come to know of the truth one day.

If you don’t tell him, odds are he is going to live with an enormous guilt of never having been there for you. He is gonna go back and blame himself ‘I should’ve picked up that hint’, ‘I should’ve known’. Spare him that. This route also involves telling him more lies, which are best avoided at this stage. 

If you tell him now and decide to face it together, he ( if he is a sensible guy) will have the satisfaction of not letting you down and warm albeit bittersweet memories of you. Please give him that chance. Any guy would want to be given that chance. Moreover, he is only 26 and chances are he will definitely meet another girl when the hurt ebbs away, so your concern about him emotionally wrecked by the news hardly matters in the long term.

Do not lose hope sister. This might sound cliche, but I have always admired the fighting spirit of cancer patients. During my internship, I met a young navy officer with leukaemia. I still remember his beaming smile and the way he talked about life with such infectious enthusiasm. I had enormous respect for that guy. Be strong and positive. It makes a huge difference. We are praying for you. Tell him the truth Please.

What happens when he finds out later. 

Please I beg tell the truth.  Firstly, I am sorry that you have cancer at this age.

I am 26 too and it really sucks to know that one might die at this early age.

Now to your question, while everyone asks you to tell him the truth and you suffer thinking there is no hope left, I ask you that why do you think there's no hope left?

Be bold and fight that fucking cancer.

Tell your boyfriend for sure. If he loves (which I am sure he might be), he will stand by you and you both shall win.

In the end, it will be a great story to tell how you fought cancer and kicked its ass. First of all I am sorry this happened to you, and also dont loose hope just yet. There is always hope. I have known someone who was given 6 months to live but they lived more than 5 years. Try and live every moment, make amends with people.

From your post, I understand that your only concern about telling your bf is that he might not be able to get over it. But what if you dont tell him and if God forbid something happens to you and he finds out later? He may never be able to have that closure and it may be a lot harder for him to move on. Tell him. It is the right thing to do.

I had a friend years ago who lived in India pursuing his education while his parents were working abroad. He was the only child. Unfortunately he met with a serious motorcycle accident. His relatives asked his father to come to India saying that his grandmother was sick. The father came to India only to find out about his son being in serious condition and in a coma with little hope of survival. The father decided not to tell the mother and my friend was in coma for 8 days after which he passed away. The mother eventually came to India after his death and found out about her son. She was never able to forgive the father because he deprived her a chance of holding her son and begging God for his life. She never recovered from it and passed away a year later.

Having said that, if you do decide to tell your bf, you should also be prepared for every type of reaction. I am sure you know him well and he is a great guy but you sometimes dont truly know a person until he is put in a situation of pressure. He might not want to deal with all this and walk away. Just be ready for that and be prepared to forgive if that happens.

&#x200B;

Good luck. If your guy and you both could watch Sweet November and A Walk to Remember, he would be strong enough to understand the situation and will support you no matter what. I know it's a cheesy suggestion, but anything that helps you both through this situation and help you both understand each other. But do tell him, don't deprive him of this and let him be a part of it, I am sure he will. 

Make every memories count that's the most important thing for both of you. God bless and I'll pray for your health. Best of Luck.❤️ The truth, tell him the truth and if you want to talk about anything, I'll be there. You're dying and the thing that worries you the most is your boyfriend feeling bad? Please tell him about your situation. If he finds out later if or when you pass away, he will be devastated. It's not right. Sit down and discuss whether you want to be together in spite of your situation.

I hope you are cured of cancer. There are so many advances in the medical field today. 

&#x200B; Given your condition , I think he would actually want to be with you. Memories with you, even a few at this stage,  would be much better than a sad breakup.  I think you should trust your boyfriend with the facts instead of treating him like how we treat children by hiding the more gory side of things. Tell him the truth. Finding out after you for that you didn't give him the chance to make his own decisions (which could be to leave your, or to make the most of the days you have together) will probably bother him more in the long run. There are things that your boyfriend looks upto you to for. You complete each other emotionally. You understand that he takes you not only as a SO but also as a friend and someone he can confide in. 
In my naive opinion, you should tell him. 

Also note that once you tell him, the way he reacts could be something you had not imagined. 3 probable cases :

- He might be very supportive and will help you get treated. 
- He might be emotionally shattered for ages. 
- He might leave you. 

You know him better, read all the comments and then take a decision. Seek a professional consultation if are not able to decide.  Firstly I""m sorry that you are having to go through this. 

However I'd sincerely ask you to tell him. **Live the journey of life**....the destination is over rated.  It feels bad about your situation and one can only imagine the trauma which you would be going through. Honestly, it is a very difficult decision. We don't know about your boyfriend and we would tell based on our context-less experiences. Choose a decision which brings peace to you based on your understanding of him and your relationship. May be you both can have something beautiful together till the time permits.  Tell him.  Even if you lie, eventually he will know the truth. Unless you live in another part of the world with no common friends. Rather than hurting him twice, making him ready for it.  just tell the truth. seriously truth works I sincerely hope that you live long and have grandchildren and be a goofy ol grandma. However, if you die, make sure that you die at the age of 27 and join the infamous '27' club and say hi to Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix and Amy winehouse from my side.
Also, be truthful with your boyfriend. I believe you can make it through this. Don't give up. If you need any sort of support, i will always be here.Cancer is terrible, i hope you stay strong.  Which stage is it? Where are you getting treated? 

And on the topic of telling your boyfriend about it, you should realise that he has a right to know about it. And you won't be doing him a favour as you would like to think. He will know later and would be scarred for his entire life. If you do love him as you claim, you tell him. Period.  He'll be heartbroken if he comes to know the hard way. Please don't make him go through this. His maturity might surprise you. Also, stay strong, OP. :* if you love him tell him.

if he loves you, he will want as much time as he can get with you. More than the question if he has a right to know, don't you think he should know it? You say you have this perfect relationship and you won't even tell him this one truth about yourself which might as well be the single most important fact of his life. While I am misty eyed while I write this to you and my heart goes out to you completely, I am putting myself in his shoes and writing this. I would be completely heartbroken when first I would have to go through the breakup and even if somehow I were to find love again, and then if by chance I get to know about you and the why of the end of the relationship I would even be more heartbroken. One can love someone so much but never so much as much as you can miss them.
You have an infinity to live in whatsoever the finite days you have with him and perhaps these days will may as well be the most important or memorable days of his life and yours as well. 
Wish I could give you all the years of my life! I'm really sorry to hear about your ailment, and I wish you strength in this time. 

As for your question, I differ to your noble intentions. There is no easy answer in this. It's HIS love and he deserves to make the choice whether he wants to suffer or not. Trust me, it will hurt him ten times more if he finds out later.

PS: You are a good person. You deserve happiness. Don't push him away. And I hope a miracle happens for you. Man what a shitty situation to end up in. I don't have any useful advice I'm afraid. Just wanted to say you are stuck in a shit show, fuck cancer. Best of luck! Tell the truth please, you will be gone but he will feel really guilty for not being there for you when you need him the most. If he decides to stand by you, you both will have share the last moments with yourselves and he can then begin to move on as he has a proper closure. If he doesn't decide to stick by you, well you achieved your purpose of breaking up.

Hopefully you get well soon though! A diagnosis of Breast cancer does not equate to dying. Consult your doctor for awareness and relief from your mental agony. Thanks. Everyone that loves you will be there with you in hard times. They would fight to be around you. 
   Let him make the decision. Don't Rob him from spending the precious limited time with someone he loves. 
   If he turns the other way and leaves, (which I personally doubt because I'm rooting for you), he didn't deserve you. 
   Make the most out of this time. It's ok to be selfish at times. Have a blast, do something you always wanted to do. And I still hope that there is some procedure or therapy that kicks this cancer's butt. 


Stay Strong! I am so sorry. Please take multiple opinions and do not give up hope.

Be honest with your boyfriend. He's been with you for 2.5 years, he needs to know the truth. You do not need to burden yourself with making an alibi to naively ""protect"" him. The reasons you mention are not very strong ones, and you should tell him exactly what you asked us. 

I wish you all the best for your treatment. Don't assume that you know what is best for your partner. Godspeed internet stranger. being a guy, i wont be able to move on if my girl tells me she is about to die

but ill be happy atleast she didn't keep it a secret.


 im imagining all this and i feel like crying. im so so so sorry  Telling truth may make him sad and you guys can plan accordingly.

But knowing the truth once you are dead will broke him for life and above!  Tell him the truth. Lies will get you (or him) absolutely nowhere. I feel he (and you) deserve the truth. If he takes some decision based on that, atleast he did so with the correct input. Lying about it, helps absolutely no one IMHO. You shouldn't do that to him, and you really shouldn't do that to yourself. Eh a bitter truth is better than a very painful lie.  I'm sorry that you have to fail this terrible situation. I'd suggest you talk to his family about you people and tell them you are dying. It is very important to have support of family in time of such great pain. Figure out a way to break it to him, he needs to know and have closure, maybe go to a counselor or psychiatrist.  You should also post on relationship advice  I have seen quite a few breast cancer patients survive and lead a normal life without their mammary glands ofcourse. Are you sure you have taken the best opinions??  Your boyfriend deserves to be given the chance to make his own decisions and live with them. Don’t rob him of his agency. 

Tell him.  The fact that his SO was dying and chose not to confide in him will mess up his mind for a long time

Also hang in there OP.Sometimes it is hard to put the effort for your friends and face them when you are dealing with this.More often than not the support system helps

Fuck Cancer You should tell the truth. It's hard but it's the right decision. Oh my goodness, I am so sorry for your troubles. Here's my advice: Do tell him what is happening because he's your boyfriend and if you guys have planned on getting (love) married, you should feel comfortable being totally honest with each other. No matter what he chooses to do, wouldn't you want him to know?  he deserves to know the truth. Tell him as it is, and then its his decision what he wants to do.  I'm surprised you made a post on an anonymous forum to debate this issue. Talk to your near and dear ones and take their help.  I am so sorry you are going through this OP. 

You need to tell your boy friend the truth! I don't have any advice but I'm sorry this happened to you. All the luck and prayers for you. :* Tell him. Not because it’s a respectable thing for him or anything, but if he loves you, it’d break his heart that he never knew about your condition and he will feel miserable about it.  Also no matter how hopeless the situation might sound, don’t lose hope.  Tell him. He has all the rights to know  about you .it's gonna be okay . People in the real world understand. I'm pretty sure you yourself won't be able to maintain this big of a lie you are planning to say. Enjoy every day with him. I think you are afraid he will walk away after you tell him the truth  isn't breast cancer curable?

"[AskIndia] Otaku (and otherwise) of /r/India, what anime are you watching and why do you like it?",17,am16yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/am16yk/askindia_otaku_and_otherwise_of_rindia_what_anime/,47,"I love anime. I think I can speak for many when I say that it's what I turn to when shit gets dark. Looking back over a decade, I can see that as long as I've been depressed I've had some anime to turn to on the side. 

I've never really become an Otaku though the last year has been tough and perhaps I've been on the path, as a NEET of sorts. Either ways, I felt there would be some here who would empathize.

One of the challenges of discussing anime is that everyone has their own personal list of must-recommends, and not many seem interested in your own lists. I guess it's like YouTube, everyone has their space and curations.

I've just started watching EVA. It feels nice to go back to the 90s for a change. And while I always perceived this as a 'weeb' anime for some reason, I watched a few YouTube videos on why people love it and realized it's sort of about depression as well. Four episodes in and I can see how compelling this show is.
 
The last anime I fell in love with was Samurai Champloo (which introduced me to Nujabes and the genre that evolved to become Low Fi). I watched that show for the music and the smooth storytelling. I wanted to be like Mugen - badass hardened street rat who's seen the world and is wise to it. But also like Jin, someone who has a deep inner calm. And a bit like Fuu, who creates the adventure, and who knows it's about the journey over the destination.

Starting a thread for people to talk about the anime they watch and how it makes them feel. Like, for example, why do you watch shonen anime - and do you feel it's inspired you to make your lives better?

More than plot and animation, I think anime does something for people's souls.",EverydayGravitas," Loved Tokyo Ghoul for a very unique story line,Death Note took me to a different level , recently watched Goblin Slayer and I must say loved the hero.
Big fan of Hellsing too.
 
Liked Rage of Bahamut Virgin soul,Konosuba too

Currently downloaded Tensei shitara slime Datta ken. Yet to watch. Hate the romantic ones. Love the ones with adventure and fantasy in them.

 Hentai

Why? Why not? Favorite Animes in no particular order:

Initial D
Hellsing
Naruto
Bleach
Evangelion
Rah-Xephon
Trigun
Samurai Champloo
Cowboy Bebop
Rurouni Kenshin


Currently watching: One Punch Man Patiently waiting for season 2 of one punch man. Rewatched hunterxhunter recently.  Currently I am exploring slice of life animes. Why? .. 
I like seeing cute girls doing cute things. I have only watched death note, your name, grave fireflies, spirited away. If any other anime is better or even comes close to these ones please let me know coz i  tried watching code geass felt asleep in 1st episode I rewatched Noragami recently to celebrate the manga getting new chapters again lol. It’s such a chill, cute, funny and sometimes really badass anime. I love all the characters in the show so I keep going back to it.
I understand you, though. Anime helps me get through stuff too. Things will be better soon. Just keep believing in it. Just finished watching Violet Evergarden it's the best anime of 2018 for me. Ghost in the Shell and Psycho-Pass 1 are my favorite anime period. One piece is an all-time favorite.

Nujabes was a great artist loved his songs - lady brown, aruarain dance, feather.

&#x200B; Watch/read black clover. Its ver interesting and a fast pacing anime  Started cowboy bebop yesterday.. 8 episodes in. BOI, it's fascinating how I didn't like it 5 years ago ditched it after first episode and now Im loving it and excited to finish it.  Gintama. It has always been my favorite. Started watching 'Hajime no Ippo'. I am not really into boxing or sports but this anime is amazing!  Mob psycho season 2. Before it the last anime I completed was bleach. All are isekai,


Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken - Started it out as I learnt the mc is a slime and powers similar to Kirby. 
Boy i absolutely don't regret it. The most fun wholesome anime I started to like and eagerly wait every Monday for next episode. Pacing is a bit slow but I still love it.

Sword art online 3 - Watching it since SOA1 well love the mmorpg concept and now loving the epic animation quality. Though mis the action in the latest season hopefully the action gets better.
.
Overlord(completed)-Enough heroe animes time for some villainy. Never knew I could watch and enjoy this. Animation quality ok but sorry wise fun and interesting. Couldn't wait for the future seasons so started reading the light novel.

Waiting for the latest season of my hero academia. Not really depressed or NEET, but I like anime. Currently watching Konosuba, Mob Psycho 100, Dororo, Boruto. My favourite is always the one I am currently watching Finished watching Castlevania a couple of days ago. Wish there were more episodes though. Trying hard to watch Mob Psycho 100 S2 and Hajime No Ippo. But I guess my love for anime has withered with time. Watch Yuru Camp for maximum comfy. Warning: You may not want to come out of your warm blanket anymore. Animes and games cover most part of my life... Currently watching MHA season 3... After this will watch Tokyo ghoul : re....

[AskIndia] Crazy 45 day travel itinerary. Two clueless Canadians need your feedback! Too many cities? too much travel time?,68,9yln0s,https://imgur.com/a/mZ3xM9W,120,,PavelSokov," Himachal Ladakh in 3 days looks unrealistic. You need to get acclimatized to height and there are high chances of getting sick tired going through those roads. Yeah that's a lot...

You need to at least anticipate a few sick days If you are traveling from December to January , avoid trains because due to fog they get late , which will screw up your schedule. Use Double Decker or Shatabdi  from Delhi to Jaipur and Agra. They usually run on time. They are much safer for foreigner compared to other trains. For other parts of India use Rajdhani Express.   You come all the way and don't visit kerala /chennai. Too many cities, especially in Rajasthan. Skip a city, add a sick day. Is Varanasi and Hampi important for you? You could consider a national park or a place in the eastern part. One of the seven sisters?

I personally consider food an important part of Indian culture, you could add a place just for it's distinct food.  Visit Kerala instead of Varanasi, there is nothing much in Varanasi and it also dirty If you wanna experience himachal stay there for atleast 3-4 days, Ladakh a minimum of 6 days.

1-2 days are fine to see a city but you’re talking about a State/region here (which is almost the size of a European country.

Don’t rush, india shouldn’t be rushed. Plus as others pointed out, keep buffer days in between. Also, check out Indiamike.com for India travel planning. The forums are very active and useful with first hand account. Fuck Varanasi. Spend those days in Himachal or Ladhak I have nothing to add to your itinerary except few general recommendations for you travel.

1. Use Uber for taxi( You can select Cash options, Uber drivers love cash payments). If Uber is not available, remember don't pay more than 20Rs per KMS anywhere. Look for good taxis, We do have good taxi cars which are comfy like Toyota Innova/Crysta.
2. Stay away from beggars, I know it sounds bit weird, but In India, begging from tourists have become profession. DO NOT ENCOURAGE THEM. NO MATTER WHAT
3. Do not eat street food unless it's hygienic. Use Zomato app to find nearest good restaurants
4. Do not go to places just because it has cool pictures on few blogs. India is not as fascinating you might think it is. People are less than friendly to outsiders
5. Crime rate is more in Northern side(I am a Northie)
6. Do not fall into hands of agents, they will overcharge you by 10x.
7. To book train tickets use govt website [https://www.irctc.co.in/nget/](https://www.irctc.co.in/nget/) or their mobile app IRCTC
8. To book bus tickets you can use [redbus.com](https://redbus.com) or their app redbus Not visiting your hometown punjab? But yea I think you'll be tired most of  the time if you're traveling by Train to all these cities. 


Hope you enjoy the visit :) 




P. S. Also don't hesitate to take necessary precautions if you're a girl  you may wanna visit Sikkim but I don't know if it's any different than Canada 1. Please be safe and apply common sense in everything you do.
2. You'll almost certainly get undue attention, please dress appropriately.
3. Don't skimp too much on accomodation. Do look up reviews before you book hotels/hostels.
4. Stay topped up on diarrhea medicine.
5. Remember to haggle. Too rushed, too much distance and variation in altitude. What month is this planned? Travel planner here, PM me for a look over and suggestions. No charge ;-) You can skip Varanasi may be, a very long travel without much to see/do Man I can't imagine planning a travel. This looks good but be careful of altitude sickness for ladakh. You might need to acclimatize (someone else also mentioned this).

Use the Allapuzha visit to truly chill out and wind down your holiday. Stay in a houseboat. Would suggest extending it and reducing Mumbai time.  what? no statue of unity?? My two Paisa. Focus on the experience and not checking lists off. Divide our schedule between North India , South India and North East India, There is simply too much stuff to cover!! Quality over quantity my friends. You can experience India even in one city.  reduce the number of cities in Rajasthan. Add one in south or northeast. You could go to Sikkim instead of Varanasi. And then all the way down to Kerala. Skip Banaras ....for God's sake !!!!! -Varanasi +Kerala

Spend more time in Leh Ladakh

Spend some time in North East too. If in Himachal Pradesh visit Kasol for some good hash if you are into it. Also ladakh from Himachal in 3 days is tough,it is almost 500 Kms from Manali.  I am tired just looking at your itinerary.   Welcome travelers, very ambitious plans to be sure. 

You will be enriched but exhausted halfway through this grueling itinerary. Pick the top 6 spots and spend more time there, exploring the culture & cuisines, they are vastly different. Befriend the locals, but stay safe of course. Easiest cuts I would suggest are Varanasi, Rishikesh and probably Jaisalmer. From Delhi, you could pull off Agra as a day trip.

Give yourself a reason to return, you won't be disappointed. And finally good luck... we appreciate every loony and toony :) My main concern is whether you guys will be able to travel 45 days continuously without being mentally exhausted or falling sick. India is incredibly chaotic, probably beyond your imagination, esp if this is your first time. 

So I think it would be wise to concentrate on one region. For eg, stick to those northern regions for this trip and it a 20 - 25 day trip.

Then come back another time and cover the southern regions. Too much rush, skip shit cities like Agra and all. And leave Leh for another time. You really need to spend 2-3 days in each city to just catch the basic vibe.  Hey guys! Two other questions. Do you know any awesome silent meditation temple or something like that? When we look it up, we only find bullshit looking yours for California moms. We want the real deal, where we sleep 4 hours, don’t eat after 12, don’t talk. Etc.

Second question. Do we need rabbis vaccine? It’s 700$ Off topic, but how are you people able to afford 2 month long vacations? What happens to your jobs? Go to a holy place (tirtha) like Jagannatha Puri or Amritsar or a Temple town of South India where applicable, rent a room or rooms and spend the whole time there, observing daily life.  Ajanta Caves over rated - not worth the travel. Visit Elephanta Caves when in Mumbai for similar experience/images whilst savings days of travel. ",AskIndia,2018-11-20 06:17:08

[AskIndia] Why are Indians so oblivious to traffic rules in their own country?,37,aubnzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aubnzl/askindia_why_are_indians_so_oblivious_to_traffic/,29,"Is there any particular reason as to why Indians are so cautious when it comes to breaking traffic rules when they go and live abroad? But on the other hand people living in India itself seem to give zero shit about following any traffic rule whatsoever. I have even come across people who on being asked to put on the seat belt reply with 'There's no traffic police in this area, so it's alright'

Isn't the entire point of having traffic rules to avoid accidents and major delays in transportation? And yet everyone seems to be completely oblivious to this and then start cussing at random people with their arse seated in the car wondering how it happened in the first place. Literally no one is exempt from this phenomenon - rickshaws tuck themselves in everywhere, bikes try to slip between vehicles, almost all car owners leave little to no space between consecutive vehicles.

No one seems to grasp the concept of staying in their own lane, if people were caught breaking the signal or speeding above the allowed limit everyone would get stopped one by one - it's just a crazy shit show. I have had several occasions where I had to personally point out to the traffic police themselves that vehicles are breaking the red light while I was crossing the road. Am I really expected to be okay with this?

You can say that many youngsters are to blame, but I don't see any elder people following a lot of rules either. It's only when someone goes through a major accident themselves, even after which they will follow only certain rules selectively so as to avoid harm to self.

I am looking for a more constructive answer than 'Because you can bribe the traffic police' I am also not looking forward to any of those 'You need to man up' bs comments. This is an entirely separate topic altogether.",beyond9thousand," > Is there any particular reason as to why Indians are so cautious when it comes to breaking traffic rules when they go and live abroad?

Enforcement. No way to bribe out of the situation. The fines at some places can be very expensive. You could lose your license. And Indians don't want to screw up their cushy life and get deported :P  Multiple reasons  
  
- Minimal punishment - The lowest traffic fine is just Rs 100 and it's the same for most of the common traffic offenses. This is just a little more than the cost of a litre of petrol. A person who owns a vehicle can surely afford to throw that money away, if caught (which so happens to be once in a while). The fine should be something that leaves a big dent in one's pocket. I believe the traffic fines should be made at least 10x the current amount so that people think twice before breaking a rule.  
  
- Corruption - As if the low fines weren't enough, people bargain with the cops and make the amount even smaller. I recall reading somewhere that a college student was on his way back from an exam and all he had was his hall ticket and pen. He had no helmet and no money and the cop took his pen. I was once caught speeding at 57 kmph (50kmph is too low a limit on the empty sections of bangalore ORR) and the speeding ticket was 300. The cop said he would let me go if I gave him 200 (and later came down to 100) without the ticket, but I insisted on the ticket. After a stern look he printed the ticket and voila, along with speeding came dangerous driving and rash driving. I reported this to the *socially active* bangalore traffic police on twitter/FB and even tagged various traffic DCPs, but there was no response.  
  
- Poor enforcement - The number of vehicles on the road are significantly more than what the traffic cops can monitor and keep tabs on, especially in metros. Many a time, the cops just let people get away with it because stopping them would disrupt the flow of traffic and cause big jams. This happens a lot in Bangalore.   
  
- Lack of infrastructure - The resources available to monitor and fine the people are very minimal. There are few speed detectors here and there, but they are also limited in the sense that they can fine only vehicles registered in that state. Some junctions have cams installed to check for various traffic offenses, but hardly do anyone get fined. Even after fines are issued through these, there's no way to monitor that people are paying these fines, until they are caught in person. There was an incident last year where a guy was caught with traffic offenses amounting to over a lakh. He was doing 140+ every day on the hyderabad ORR.   
  
- Ignorance and chalta hai attitude - Many people don't even know what the traffic rules are. They just see what others do and do that. At a red light, all it takes is one guy to jump, and a lot of them would follow. Many of them don't have driving licenses or just paid the agents to get a license for them without taking a test etc.   Indian licenses usually don't allow indians to live and drive abroad. They work for small trips, but if they want to drive for a longer term, they have to finish the theory and driving tests abroad. I'm actually going through this right now.  

The biggest issue with Indian driving is just education, and that is exactly what is fixed when people live abroad.  Who's gonna tell it to us? Driver training and licensing is a morbid joke in our country. We lose millions of our brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, friends and family members, all because we give tools to apes without training them first.

There are hundreds of driving schools all over the nation, but what do they teach? 10 days or 15 days is enough for you to know how to handle a vehicle, not nearly long enough to know how to handle the vehicle safely with thousands of other motorists on the road. Lack of enforcement basically. We have some of the best laws in the world but almost non existent enforcement. 

 Most Indians are oblivious to most other rules in their own country - why should traffic rules be an exception? Because it's extremely easy to get away with breaking them. What do you mean ? Everyone breaks traffic signals everywhere. ",AskIndia,2019-02-25 03:43:56

Cousins used to treat me like a servant and for the most part my dad was unavailable and only cared if I were to make money but never stood up for me or never even tried to bring me up (expected fucking nothing). Thanks to a rough 25 years despite being in a good place relatively in life I have high amounts of repressed anger.



Basically I was bigger than most (6'3"" and confident as fuck) so I was made to be feel ashamed of my size by everyone which led to low self esteem, and everyone loved bullying someone bigger than them so even when I grew up Everytime I was bullied I never used force and sucked it up.




How to release this anger in a healthy way? I've tried sports, gym, everything. I want to be emotionally stable and healthy before I start a new job so I really want to know if someone successfully relieved of their anger.



Asking in randia also because the preferred method is screaming and there are no open places to scream here.",for_acedemia," See a therapist  What you're calling anger is mostly shame and fear. Shame that you let it happen to you and fear that it'll probably happen again and you won't do anything about it. Inner criticism is far worse than outer critics. You need to start becoming nice to yourself first. When that genuinely happens standing up for yourself won't be that hard, like you'd do for anybody you truly love. Sadly, loving ourselves doesn't come that easily, because most people learn to see themselves from others' eyes. I'll tell you a secret, it's completely okay to get bullied, that is the nature of the world and not just for humans. Because there's always somebody smarter stronger than you. Most people will say you could use that as a fuel to become smarter stronger yourself, that's one approach, but it won't bring lasting happiness. Being okay and fulfilled with your weaknesses and flaws truly brings and happiness. And the knowledge that you're not passing the negativity to others. Generally, people like you who are not bullying somebody else weaker to vent are naturally better humans. You can keep aside all the religions of the world, this is the true religion, letting the negativity die at you. But like I said in the beginning, you have to learn to handle shame and fear by looking at yourself NOT from your critics' point of view. This is what probably was implied when Shiva drank the poison. And when Christ died for the sins. This is the inherent nature of the world. I tried meditation, going on peaceful place but these doesn't work in my case. So I masturbate to rid out shit.  Load up GTA:SA and drive over anyone and everyone I can find or load up RDR and ride a horse through the country side. Seek out for a good therapist. It is lot of trial and error for finding a good therapist. But, remember to always throw the mask and be open about everything.  My height is not as per 'Indian norms'. I got bullied half my life, got involved into smoking, drinking at very early age. After some time i realised this is not my life. I started meditation (learnt it from my local yoga centre). Stopped smoking, drinking, joined gym and starting believing in myself. Right now i dont have a job sometimes that makes me angry but try to control it. Sometimes i say things which i never meant to but i say sorry as soon as i realise my mistake. It helps to keep me grounded. And life is good.  First you need a goal in life, so pick up something worthwhile. Second you need to resolve the anger. The best way to do that is by writing down things that made you angry. If you can assume that each of the things that made you angry is a result of something that you wanted to do, and have the potential to do, but you were not able to because of that emotional outburst, then you have a way of making productive use of all that memory.  Third is to learn to control yourself. Which is different from withholding or limiting yourself. Control means you can regulate your emotions at will. That happens when you realize that everyone else is as clueless as you about their emotions. They bring anger/frustration into a conversation unknowingly. When they do bring it, they don't know how to keep it under control either. If you can learn to recognize when you get emotional, and you can find a way to pull yourself out of that state, then you can keep control of your anger, the key is to know that you can and that your own subconscious holds the key to that. Exercise or masturbate Meditation and mindfulness? Therapy / counselling >Basically I was bigger than most (6'3"" and confident as fuck) so I was made to be feel ashamed of my size by everyone which led to low self esteem, and everyone loved bullying someone bigger than them so even when I grew up Everytime I was bullied I never used force and sucked it up.

Wow. Just goes to show, nobody is spared suffering, even those we'd assume would be spared. I see you posting off and on but had no idea you were going through this (but then, how would I?)

There's this AI chatbot that is receiving a lot of coverage in the media. Maybe it can be of some use to you: [https://woebot.io/](https://woebot.io/) I used to do push ups until I was too tired to move. Go to Eastern Europe or the US, and go to a shooting range, I am sure you could try different kinds of guns and also get rid of that pent up anger. Find someone who is being bullied.Try to make friends with them.It wont be hard.Look into your family and find the less blessed person.Help them,help them reach out and stand up for themselves.Help them to fight back(peacefully ofcourse) and establish their worth.You will find happiness in that.That you were able to bring change in someone elses life.That you helped someone who is going through the same shit you did.

Try it out >  want to be emotionally stable and healthy before I start a new job

don't connect these two. treat them as separate. emotional health is a life-long quest (for everyone) The four noble truths and the eightfold path of Buddhism.

Maximum serenity, minimum restlessness and violence.

OTOH, there is also a practical way to vent, but it is a patch and damaging in the medium term (everything is ok in the long term):

Cussing the hell out of each of the people who wronged you.

The damage is that your language becomes very foul and you start using abuses for even normal things. The benefit is that the pressure building up inside gets released and the sorrow doesn't go to deep down into your heart and make you a bitter person.

---------------

I think you should always remind yourself of eternal truths:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot#Reflections

People have insecurities because of memetics (picked up from others) or genetics (some creative assholes invent new abuses and crimes). Mostly they don't know or control what happens in their life and pass on their burdens to you. These burdens keep passing around like rogue data packets on the internet from node to node, some nodes becoming power-relays, while some just temporary relays (got into bad company then got out OR got depressed, then got fixed)

There is no telling what shitstreams are headed your way in this network (life), the best you can do it have a built-in firewall against rogue packets and don't get infected. Gentle reflection / gentle introspection is a constant necessity in life. 

""I'm not like that"" and ""I don't need this crap in my life"" are typical things to say to yourself and GTFO of abusive situations.

You can also take the saint approach and study the insecurities of the source of the shitstream. Then you will feel bad for them and how shitty their life is and how yours is marginally (or significantly) better as you can identify a shitstream while they cannot.

Nobody, except sociopaths and some psychopaths (genetics), is born evil, evil spreads through society and pollutes good minds like a virus on a network (memetics).

Anger is a self-harming response - imagine if every  computer anti-virus randomly deleted its own files just because it encountered a virus on the network. Do not do this. 

Develop a non-violent response based on identifying and ignoring the virus passed to you. People are shit because by the time they are 18 they have been dragged through tons of shit floating around.

Many metaphors, same advice - identify it, quarantine it, then let it go.

EDIT:

What people do not realise is that anger is hurting yourself, it is first-class self-harm. When you commit violence in your mind, it's _your_ mind that bears the brunt of the violence. This is why the really wise criminals never get angry. They are cool, collected, calculated and very very effective - spies, for example, or bosses of large corporations or lawyers. Of course, don't be like them, but learn how even they are never self-harming.

Deep breathing (eyes closed), holding your breath, watching your thoughts and letting it go (some amount forgiveness, some amount discarding a bag of poop) are useful techniques.
 Try to make someone smile or happy every day. Help an old man lift his bag. Buy a poor kid some food or help in an orphanage. Compliment someone on a job well done. Really mean it. It will make your day. Gradually your anger issues must reduce . I have been doing meditation for 10 minutes a day for the last 5 months. Have started seeing some results recently.
Meditation probably won't help you get over it, but to accept it, and to manage it.  I have the same problems these days. An intense and tiring workout helps for a short time. Mainly being tired helps.  Just let it go. You cannot change the past but you can build a better future for yourself. I guess the basic question is how is this repressed anger affecting your life now?  > the preferred method is screaming 

I do this too. Stops me from doing/saying things in the heat of the moment which I'll regret later. I usually drive around and with all the windows up and music turned up, scream at the top of my lung. Few years back I was furious and lost my voice for few days doing this.

&#x200B; Punching bag Scream. To muffle your voice, use a pillow or something. 

I am going through the same. 

In my case. It is weird because I don't feel anything for humans except rage. If you are open to trying : dynamic meditation of OSHO. 
Read about it before rejecting it as ""meditation"". It is more physically intense than a 400 m run Go outside and do things on your own, like be independent. Move out, get a job, pay your own rent and be independent. That will teach you everything you need to know. It's a long process.

What worked for me was telling myself, ""I control what defines me"" Folks here have already given a good advice, so I'm just gonna be repeating some of it. It's also what helped me. Doesn't mean it will help you too, everybody is different. But you could take it as a starting point and see what works.

1. One thing I didn't see anyone suggesting is journaling. Write. In a diary, in a google doc under password, on a blog no one knows about. But write precisely how you feel. It's going to be shameful sometimes, but that's part of the process. Shameful in the sense that I used to think, 'I am a nice person, how can *I* feel this way about others?!' So be it, you aren't acting on it, you just need to voice it. I used to write in a notebook as well as in a google doc. Some of those notebooks have holes in them because I used to stab them with the pen :/

2. After sometime, reread your entries. Sometimes when I did that, I used to feel the rage all over again, but sometimes I could realize, 'oh ok I could've acted differently here'.

3. Therapy. *Essential.* Because a good therapist provides you tools to deal with your own baggage better than an internet stranger!

4. I read this somewhere and adopted it for myself: nature abhors vacuum. If you're emptying yourself of anger, you need to replace it with something else. Otherwise, old mind habits can come back easily. Just good old 'old habits die hard' kind of thing. By replacing, I mean, by other mind activities. So yes, sports, hobbies, new skills, new courses, anything. (I tried to learn foreign language for a while, and my class ages were 14 to 39. It was bliss!)

Oh, yeah, and of course fap :D

Good luck! It will sort itself out once you're about 30. That's when most people suddenly wake up and realize that the entire world and this thing we call ""life"" is nothing but a big joke. We have given our own existence waaay too much importance. We're microbes on a floating rock that can be extinguished into oblivion if Jupiter decides to sneeze and send one of its 200 moons hurtling towards us. The reason you're angry is that because you have inherently believed that everyone else is correct and that they're smarter than you. But take one look at their life and you'll realize that barring a very very very small percentage of the population, everyone else is just lost, delusional and chasing after some paper dream that they don't even know why they're chasing after. Think of how stupid the average person is, and then realize that half of the population is more stupid than that. This thing called ""society"" is a big sham set up by people who can't tell their head from their ass. Once you realize all of this, then you'll accept that you're just like everyone else, a small cog in a big wheel, grinding their life away so that you can have more Gandhi papers in your bank account but without any time to spend those papers. Everyone else is part of this machine, no one can escape it unless he/she truly, truly wants to and is willing to sacrifice everything else for it. As long as someone is part of this machine, then that person is neither better than you nor inferior to you, he/she is just as lost, delusional and stupid as you, which means he/she is an equal, and there is no need for you to take his/her word seriously.

But you are at an age where you cannot comprehend this. You still think that you're the center of the universe, and that your life is so fragile that someone can ruin your day by sneezing in your general direction. You need to step out of that shell you have built around yourself and realize how small and insignificant your so-called ""identity"" is, and how equally small and insignificant rest of humanity is. It will take a long long time to understand this. Until then, just keep going with the flow. As long as you keep going until you're about 30, then you will automatically understand this. For now, best of luck - things like music and inspirational videos can help to sustain and feed the illusion of ego until you no longer need the ego and these support accessories, and things like sports / gaming / netflix can help to keep the mind distracted until you learn to control the mind. That's how everyone else gets by, should work for you too. Look up stoicism. Vipassana. Workout ! Convert those anger to insane gainzz Pump iron period. Imagine the faces in plates and dumbles. U did not try hard enough.  buy a punching bag. Surprisingly, breaking stuff helps, I won't advice it though. Travel man, travel alone to new places; it helps a lot. Also, music.  By channelling that potential energy into something productive.  Learn to compartmentalize. Not just anger, everything. I've become very good at putting things away that I don't need to attend to immediately. 

Anytime you struggle with something - anger, anxiety, etc. - ask yourself: does this impact me in the immediate moment? Do I need to deal with it right now or can I put it away for later?

I don't have any anxiety issues because of this. Whenever I get slightly anxious, I just put it away for the future.

Same with anger. Do you *really* need to be angry right now, or can you deal with it n the future? Emigrate.. From your words it seems more like bundled up frustration which needs to be relieved more than released. You should be seeking help from professionals like a therapist or a psychiatrist before this evolves any further into a mental disease like depression which is a common outcome of such cases.

Take care and don't be afraid to reach out for help. If you feel you are reasonably mentally stable, I suggest trying out a Vipassana retreat. It can be a little trying and hard but unless you've been diagnosed with something like a clinical depression, it is worth giving a shot.  Fap. A lot.

Does anybody know about this? Is it true? Are there any hidden charges, disadvantages, etc? I'm skeptical because everything we hear about Jio is too good to be true.",psbankar," I have applied for the jio fiber as well, initially we have to pay ₹4500 for their devices such as set up box for TV and router. The money is refundable if you want to stop using their services. Apart from that till their commercial launch which is in 6 months in Hyderabad their service is free with the data usgae up to 1150 gb. If you're being offered Jio Fiber, get Jio Fiber. It's brilliant Many ISPs have lowered internet rates or ditched FUP because of this, if jio launches with a data cap It'll be a huge disappointment. I wanted to get JioFiber at my place after seeing my cousin ""testing"" (enjoying it free) for over a year or two at his place. So I placed a call to ask for my building permission. They haven't laid it yet. Now I know my skeptical society secretary is OP who must have shooed them away. /s My friend has been using jio fiber for about 2 years for free. Get it installed in your building and use it for free until they come up with plans and decide on the pricing. (And are ready for official rollout) ""Free"" means they'll spy on you by creating a profile of you based on your browsing data. I mean, you could let em set up and it's the choice of your building co-tenants to join or not. Doesn't harm you to share space with some fibre.

I'm very torn on Jio. On one hand, yes it's trendy/important to resist Reliance but on the other hand it is equally important to put the fear of ~~God~~ Ambani into ISPs like Airtel and Chodhafone who really take customers for granted. They overcharged customers for months and months after Jio and Act Fibre introduced cheaper plans (referring to 4G and broadband respectively). They are companies who I feel if given their own way and no competition, will absolutely disadvantage Indian consumers. Therefore, it's important to have Jio on their asses. Which city? It's legit, they came to my house a couple weeks back. Looks like they're doing a trial run. I had to pay a refundable deposit of Rs. 4500. The 'plan'(not official since it's a trial run) I'm currently on is 100Mbps (1100GB FUP). OP which Town are you in ? Just so I can know how fast Jio Gigabfiber is expandng? My society has been having Jio Fiber for the past 2 months but I haven't joined because 

* They have a monthly cap of 100 GB
* They're currently have a 3 months free trial but there's no information about the pricing. Last week another Jio guy came and he told me plans would come out after the 20th
* They wouldn't connect the fiber to my existing Cisco router saying I have to rent their router which I'm not eager to do since mine is much secure, advanced and comes with a lot of functions You've to pay a deposit of 4.5k. But after that it's free for a few months  They have chosen localities in each of the cities/towns they are planning to set it up in the first phase and are setting the network up there. They plan on extending connections to big societies next. Since it is in trial phase, you only have to pay for the network device being set up in the home. No word on pricing yet. In my city they also have been testing TV channels over the same network.  

What I am really curious about is the promised use of VR for shopping etc. That will truly be next level thing as far as current choices go. Expect competitor's cables to be cut one fine day - I'd give it a 10-15% chance 100GB download limit per month ? No thanks.",AskIndia,2018-12-17 13:52:49

Ohh and you could walk into a paki resturant at 3AM (the time some of them close here), and they'd still make sure to offer you something and a server or two might stay behind.

No kidding, the 3AM story is true. Me and my buddy were starving after drinking a lot and nothing to eat at my place. We wandered and came across some lads drinking chai&smokes outside planning to close the restaurant. They offered us to have a seat and food, however they gave us leftovers which were a bit stale, but the hospitality was nice.  Promoting local music Music. Example is Coke Studio.

""Where is your native place""

""Where are you from?""

These are common questions but I have no answer to it. I grew up in a different country, had my schooling in a different city, have my parents from two different parts of Kerala and have my (recently) permanent address in a different city.

I could say I am from the city I live in and have my family home in, but I've not lived here more than a year and know nothing about it. I could say I'm from the city I was born in , but again, I know nothing about it. When festivals happen here, I see them for the first time. I don't have any local friends.

I could say I am from the metropolis that I spent the largest chunk of my life in but then I am not Kannadiga.

I could say I am from the foreign country I grew up in and had my childhood from but then LOL that country doesn't give anybody citizenship. And I don't want it even if they paid me for it.

The more I think about it, the stranger the question of where you're from becomes, if you, like me, have no fixed roots. Where are you from if your parents come from two different cities? Where are you from if you spent many years in Bangalore but feel no affiliation to one city over another? Where are you from if you don't speak the local dialect and language of the place you are from?

inb4 ""I am from India"" because using that in a conversation is going to get you significant eyeroll. That only works on passport officers.

",UngilUndy," I just mention my permanent address. I don't consider it home but it's the easiest answer for people to understand and it's the right answer for legal purposes. This is a good one. There are always people who don't belong to just one place, more so these days, but this has been the case for decades, it's not that new a concept. So if you analyse the question a bit further - it's the motivation behind the question not the question itself - is what we should be looking to answer.

If the question is nice and curious ""Where are you from"", and it's because the person asking is warm towards you and want to know you more - and of course that's probably for them to find ways to relate to you closer, and to you know, to get along better. In that case, you should answer what works best. 

Lets assume your parents are from Palakkad, you grew up in Dubai, and then lived for a while in Kochi, did university in Chennai and living in Bangalore. If a guy from Karnataka asks you where you are from, you should say your background is Kerala but you have been living elsewhere. If the guy asking the question is from TN, emphasis your background is Kerala, but you lived in TN. If the guy asking the quesiton is Malayalee, answer is kinda same, but you can be specific, that you are from Palakkad but been living elsewhere most of the time. The culture at your home is probably what you are culturally / background-wise - and that's probably what your parents brought with them. But for everything else, you are flexible - you are good person with a lot of life experience and can relate to all types of people and backgrounds. It's a good thing. You NOT poorer by not having a set place, but you are richer because of your various life experiences. From here around is my answer if anyone asks. ~~^(dehli se hu bhenchod)~~ I'll tell you some of my own details to help you determine where do you actually belong from.

&#x200B;

My father is a Bengali. Native : West Bengal. I did my schooling from Mumbai, graduation from Kolkata, Post graduation somewhere in the North (anything beyond Maharashtra is North FFS). So if anyone asks me where do I belong to, my answer is always I'm a Bengali but I permanently reside in Mumbai. So yes, you could mention it the same way. I'm a Malayali but I reside in XYZ city. So yeah I am a tiger from the terai grasslands located in the North eastern part of Modern day Uttar Pradesh .My habitat destroyed and my mates killed ,i will have my revenge in this life or the next . Home is where you live. You can say that you're from the metropolis you grew up in. If someone asks if you are a Kannadiga, just say no, I'm not. I’m guessing you grew up in the Gulf, based on your post. Same here. Was born in a random town in TN, grew up in the Middle East, attended college in TN and now I live in Pune. 

“Where are you from?” never fails to stir up a mini identity crisis. Where are you from? From where I lived since I was a kid till I become 20.


Doesn’t matter where I was born. Where I spent most part of my life matters in my case.  I usually say my parents are from ""enter name"" state but I grew up in ""enter name"" city. Simple. I have spent most of my life in metro but native place usually refers to your father's hometown (grandfather's home). My father had to shift to different cities every 5-10 because of job and we visit native place during festivals or special ocaasions only. I usually ask people if they have time for a drink, because it will take that long to explain. 

born in the gulf - oh so you're arab - no

parents from india - oh so you're indian - you could say that, but need a visa to visit my folks these days, and barely speak the languages

lived/worked in US - oh so you're american - i suppose, but no family or ties there

livingworking in Brazil - wtf are you doing here - just chilling bro.

Where are you from - somewhere on the planet is probably the closest answer. Wahin se .... I think this question goes back to where your ancestors are from. In the past _most families_ remained in the same geographical area so it was easier to answer. 

Now we have the nuclear family structure, freedom to travel so it's much harder to answer. Parts unknown. Vishal, wassup bro?",AskIndia,2019-02-22 17:01:58

Have dashcam  installed in your car. Don't accept anything, if it's your mistake then say sorry and talk about insurance claim.

According to RTO rules he should have valid insurance so incase of damage to vehicle he can claim insurance and does not have to threaten you to pay full amount.
In case you kill someone in road accident, even though it was his mistake check if there is cctv camera around for footage otherwise escape from the scene.
There are stupid people who will claim it was your mistake even though it wasn't.
Probably beat you and damage your car if the other person is dead.

 Your accepting the mistake has nothing to do with your  getting beaten up. 

It depends on the situation. In my experience it is very important to diffuse the situation and get out of that place. Most of the time, a sorry works better than an argument.  People die because of trying to reason with these animals. Better to just drive off.  Last month, I hit some girl's dog near agara lake. The dog is safe, the girl screamed, and some auto drivers and uncles tried to stop me, I drove off without stopping. I am very sure that some fucker might beat the shit out of me if I had stopped. 

I love pets. I am sorry for the girl and her dog, but the dog appears to be chasing some other street dog and the girl wasn't able to control it and when it comes to my life vs the dog life, I would choose my life without a second thought. 

I would love to stop there , ask sorry and check if the dog is alright. But you know, I am a guy and she is a girl and all surrounding people want to be heros, so it would be stupid to stop there.

I just don't know what else to do.",Throaway607," If your concern is being broke very soon, apply for jobs in all fast food chains that you can name. Apply to all call centres you can google. All the retail stores in every mall in Hyderabad. Call them, email them, go there and talk to the manager and get shooed away till you find someone. Once you're there, then you plan how to make things *better*. It's not the end. It's just a scary beginning. [deleted] From my experience of soliciting jobs in McD outlets: 
Go to any McD outlet, request any employee (preferably at the counter) that you need to talk with the store manager. Ask the store manager if there are any vacancies in the oultlet. Most of the times, they do have vacancies especially in a busy outlet. Store manager will ask your expected salary. Don't quote him a figure (I quoted an over-estimated figure and never received the call from him again). Just say that I am ready to work at the standard rates as per the company's policy. FYI, standard pay at McD is Rs.49 per hour. So, earnings will depend upon the hours you are willing to put in, lets say Rs.49 * 10hrs * 25 days. Meals will be provided in McD probably for lunch and dinner. Some store managers might ask you to wear a white shirt for the 1st 2 days for training. You will require documents like aadhar, PAN, marksheets/certificates etc of your school/college on the 1st day. 

Get into this job only if you are in urgent need. I wasn't in such need, hence I declined after listening to all their terms and conditions. go to malls and walk in every store and ask if they have an opening, your english is good, say them you can speak english. 

or go to fastfood chains like kfc, mc donalds and try. else try dhabas or hotels.  Not what you have asked for.. but my 2 cents:

I think you have to prepare better to move out permanently. Consider going back to your home for time being and prepare a plan. 

I am not recommending you to stay in a toxic home forever. May be set a deadline of 1 month for yourself. In this time prepare for permanent takeoff. Consider opportunities available to you and prepare for them if required..

Stay strong brother ! Instead of going to a completely different state. Try to find something in Maharashtra. It will be much easier considering you will not have any issues with language and such.

I would recommend that you go back and talk to your parents. Take their help and then do something. Construction and hotels are the only jobs that I know that give you immediate boarding and lodging.  Do you have friends in Hyderabad ? check with the hyd local marathi groups there are a lot of them here and would be more inclined to help you Why not Mumbai.   Amazon hiring 24/7 for CS positions, decent salary considering you have no degree. I can refer you. Considering you can speak English well (from your post), you can apply in call centres or any shop as sales guy. But you'll need money till first pay check. If not try construction sites such as Hyderabad metro. They'll provide accommodation.  Keeping in mind the documents you have in hand, I'd suggest seeking opportunities to drive for a living immediately. Ola and Meru operators are in constant dirth of good drivers.

So you can take that route as well, unless you have other plans. You should really go back to your house. And then try getting a job nearby, get a rented place and then move out. Leaving home this fast without much plans won't do any good. I'm looking for freelance writers for my company.

[AskIndia] Why is Math taught in India in a hotchpotch manner?,27,ahw9tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ahw9tx/askindia_why_is_math_taught_in_india_in_a/,22,"In USA, the Math education typically follows following sequence: Pre-algebra -> Algebra -> Pre-Calculus -> Single Variable Calculus -> Multi variable Calculus -> Differential equations -> Linear Algebra -> Other advanced Math courses.... 

It seems a pretty logical sequence of Math education to me, on the other hand, the Math education in India is divided on the basis of Class/College_year and topics from each Math subject are thrown in to make a soup of it. I think that studying a single subject in one go is much better than studying it in small chunks over many years. ",LongDraft," I remember it as slightly different, but comparable to the US methodology:

Basic Arithmetic and Basic Geometry in  Std. 1 to 4; basic algebra, slightly advanced geometry, introductory linear algebra in middle school with introductory statistics in Std. 5 to 8; trigonometry and introductory calculus, introductory probability and slightly advanced statistics with introductory matrix mathematics in Std. 9 and 10; advanced linear algebra, differentiation and integration, compound probability, introductory statistical distribution sets, irrational number theory in Std. 11 and 12.

This is for the ICSE board circa. 2004-2006.... The progression may have been there but our teacher never taught the why's of math. Probably because thats how they were taught themselves.  it was same as us when we were taught math. Because our education system is fucked and people who design the curriculum have their heads up their arses. Answers your question mate? since the concepts are closely related. its hard to differentiate between subjects.  I remember studing Math in pretty much the same order as OP has mentioned here. But what sucks in India is the quality of teachers. I remember hating math till 9th Standard, and I started liking the subject later on which I could attribute only to the change in the teacher.  > I think that studying a single subject in one go is much better than studying it in small chunks over many years.

This is debatable since there are memory retention systems which ape this staggered/split-up approach. 

Its a technique which is suggested by many experts. Not sure if Indian system was based on that intentionally but it ended up like that for a reason, probably practical/anecdotal evidence from the educators/board, etc.  It's the same here, what are you talking about? Everything in india is taught in a hotchpotch manner. 

We are, in many ways, an apathetic nation. Well, Indians are of the mindset learn maths even if you're not going to pursue it in future till 10th. We're taught basic of advanced maths which makes us like 'Jack of this trade'. Funny once when I asked what's the need of learning a particular topic from my teacher and he said, so you may be able to teach your children maths one day...

Anyways CBSE has reformed greatly in this department and from next session on, Maths section would be divided into [BASIC and ADVANCED for 10th standard students](https://www.timesnownews.com/amp/education/article/cbse-10th-board-exams-massive-reform-introduced-for-class-x-mathematics-2-levels-for-students-from-2020/345337) I'm a middle school math teacher in USA my school goes pre algebra, algebra, geometry, then algebra 2, then it is up to the student if they want to go into calculus and beyond when they get to high school",AskIndia,2019-01-20 18:11:28
"[AskIndia] People who dropped out of college, why? and how are you doing right now",13,app6ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/app6ee/askindia_people_who_dropped_out_of_college_why/,5,,sky-gazer," Things weren't working out, Too many backlogs wasn't even interested But I had options to work join a firm with low pay af worked my way I make decent now. I am doing Okayish my friend make more but can't complain. **Background**

Never wanted to get into engineering. Parental and peer pressure got me trapped. Then the cycle started - backlogs, year drops, exam, fail, exam, fail ... eventually started spending my free time blogging. Blogging got me a few freelance assignments for content writing when it was fairly new to India (this must be 2007-2009). Some more freelance gigs landed me ad agency contacts and friends who helped me find a good full-time job. 

**Current Scenario**

Took me a couple of years to settle in, but I have sailed well so far. This is my 7th year of full-time professional employement content marketing and I have bought a 2BHK recently (loan pe, ofcourse), been on two international vacations in the last 3 years, and can live the life I want to without struggling much for money (buy gourmet groceries once in a while, go out to eat once a week, order food once a week, go cloth shopping and mall hopping once a month or every two months, spend on basic-priced things like books, a smartphone, an Echo Dot, etc without having to think if I can afford it or not). The bigger stuff needs some thought - for eg. buying a house was not an easy decision, it meant postponing any plans to buy a car by another year or two (I have a bike), or a major furniture purchase like dining set or modular kitchen upgrade needs to be planned in advance. Thankfully, my Dad is pretty solid when it comes to investments (I don't understand squat about it). So he invests some of my bucks in stocks, MFs, FDs and those savings come handy when making such decisions.

**Obstacles**

Not having a degree matters - the 'IT giants' will almost always throw in a spanner during interviews. Few (1 in 10 maybe, nothing to worry about, but don't let it fluster you) employers will say shit like but you don't have a degree or any relevant education, so please compromise on salary. Financial stability (Settle ho gaya as it is called in India) is not as easy as it is for others who have gone down the beaten path and done the done things.

**Satisfaction**

Of the highest bloody degree. I look at myself and my life and feel I have done fairly well the last 7-8 years, and its only because of my decision to drop out. Had I continued I would have got stuck in the never-ending cycle of clearing backlogs. Even if I had become an engineer, I would have made a bad one and would have struggled getting through my job.

**All-in-all**

The years wasted trying to clear Engineering backlogs before finally dropping out meant I started working late, started earning late. I look at peeps I went to school or junior college with and see them buying a house or a car, getting married, kids and stuff - I do feel I have fallen behind by atleast 3 years, but nothing to complain. If you've figured it out and are willing to struggle and work your way up, its doable. Although some days there is the repentance that if I had put my foot down early in my life instead of when I finally did, I might have been able to pursue what I wanted - academically and professionally. But then most days, I feel I didn't do too bad for myself even after dropping out. Wasn’t interested in my course. Doing great now. Love my job if not necessarily the organisations I work with but much happier than if I had gone into the stereotypical courses Dropped out of Enginnering. Was not interested. Period. 

Did a distance degree because shaadi mushkil hoga. 

Had issues finding proper IT work before distance. Still was looked down upon by HR when submitting certificates and explaining the drop out bits. Found work at a good bank doing IT in Hyd. 

Moved abroad to study a Grad Dip. Lived happily ever after. ",AskIndia,2019-02-12 12:07:41

[AskIndia][NP] How popular is Valentine's Day in India?,39,aocd92,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aocd92/askindianp_how_popular_is_valentines_day_in_india/,48,Do you celebrate it? Do you believe it's a western holiday? ,aguyfrominternet," Bajrang Dal would like to have a talk with you. It's very popular among hindutva hardliners.. Others not so much.. Bajrang dal wants ur location. Bajrang Dal wants to recruit you! Its so popular that couples get married by strangers. Even if the common man forgets about it, goons will make sure that you are reminded by appearing on TV. way too popular in Bangalore, can't find a place to go out and just have a meal on that day. I believe it is a holiday that is a capitalist wet dream. Commercialisation ruined it just as it did other days.

Valentine's day has no place in Indian culture because romantic love has no place in India except in our films and TVs. So when these kids inundated with notions of romance take to the streets and public parks, the self appointed guardians of CULTURE will use violence in open defiance of the law to promote their political party to a people that will tacitly approve because sour grapes.


 In urban areas, it's very popular. Majority of young couples celebrate it. we are given a national-level public holiday on this day except for goa - they are made to work extra hours on this day as most tourists expel max semen on this auspicious day in this specific state and the same needs to be cleaned before the next couple jumps in.

most of our young people moan and many redditors groan on this god-given holy day. are you from bajrang dal ? I’m a college student and it’s pretty popular on campus. It’s a common site to see couples camping out with food and candles. Personally, I’m not one for that but I do make a day of it with my SO.  A holiday is a holiday. We don't discriminate between them. We want them all.  Make your loved one feel special on a regular day. Makes it more surprising and less of a formality. Hence I don't believe in Valentine's day.  Enough to sell merchandise and getting surprise marriage. Pretty popular in school and college campuses. I don't think this generation of young working adults care. Check this video.

I am looking for an app in which I can enter each task and set the interval or date/month in which to be done. And after doing that I can cross it off.

So when I open this app, for each month the app should show me a fresh checklist consisting of things to be done that month. An App to Barter your skills for free.

Ankit knows to play guitar. He wants to learn cooking. 
Anjali knows cooking. She wants to learn guitar.
Why the fuck is there no app to match Ankit and Anjali?

Ankit opens this app.

1 - I want

2 - I give

3 - I common

He goes to I want, clicks on plus button, searches ""Cooking class"" and adds it.
Ankit then goes to I give, searches ""Guitar Class"" and adds it.

Ankit meets Anjali.

Why doesn't the locked Mukesh Ambani page on Wikipedia have a controversy section? [AskIndia],184,a00x4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a00x4g/why_doesnt_the_locked_mukesh_ambani_page_on/,41,"This is the Wikipedia page for [Mukesh Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_Ambani). It is locked, fairly simpering in nature, and lacks any controversy section.

The equivalent entry on [Dhirubhai Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani) is not locked but is also fairly blank in its description. 

Wikipedia is supposed to a neutral entry for human knowledge curated by the community. In instances where an article is repeatedly vandalized or at constant risk of vandalization, it can be expected to be ""locked"" from edits that are not approved by a higher power.

I'm not the first to mention this. One Quora user (in a post titled ""How corrupt is Mukesh Ambani?
"") described his attempt to edit the page and how it was stumped by higher-level editors.

In the case of India's richest and most powerful person, it is understandable that certain information is undesirable in the public realm. However, that does not mean we should bow our heads.

Finding out anything about the Ambani's is notoriously difficult. Sure, you could follow newspaper headlines over the least few years but they have a tendency of being fickle. Remember when Ambani's kid mowed someone over in an Aston Martin? Or when the family was involved in a [bitter feud](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19890831-bombay-dyeing-reliance-feud-ril-executive-arrested-on-charge-of-conspiring-to-kill-nusli-wadia-816444-1989-08-31) with Nusli Wadia (that culminated in a murder charge)?

The saga of Ambani is too vast to remember everything. Only a person who reads the paper every day for the last 75 years will know their true history and even then he knows just a fraction. I admit, I don't know enough. But I do know that there is a concerted attempt to control information about Reliance.

We see it in [Reliance ownership of the media](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/the-big-five-the-media-companies-that-the-modi-government-must-scrutinise-to-fulfill-its-promise-of-ending-crony-capitalism), in their purchase and regulation of our satire ([they even bought out FakingNews.com](https://www.medianama.com/2013/05/223-firstpost-fakingnews/) in its early days - understanding early that such sites could be far more critical than investigatory journalists and far more apt as well). We see it in [near billion dollar](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-row-anil-ambani-files-rs-5000-crore-defamation-suit-against-national-herald-congress-leader/articleshow/65546040.cms) defamation cases. We see it when books that try to tell this story [are banned from being published in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Polyester_Prince).

You know what is happening. I know what is happening. We all know it. Anyone on the street will tell you this and that about how Ambani pulls every string. And I will be the first to be realistic. 

**However, an open ledger of information does not have the same weakness as a media organisation that has to pay salaries.** 

Use a proxy and edit. Cite your sources well. What are you doing wrong when it is done in the name of the truth? But before this can even happen, don't we need to get past that lock?

To get an edit made through a semi-protected article, you need to propose an edit on its talk page. 

Honestly, if I knew enough and wasn't afraid myself, I'd make the edits. But I think there might be smarter and better people on here who could give me added perspective. I don't have experience editing Wikipedia and I believe in this happening to a fair standard.

Just putting this out there. My apologies if my own action seem toothless. ",Top-_-_-_-_-Secret," There are pr agencies that control wiki accounts that hold a lot of powers of change and edits. These accounts have been slowly been taken over wikipedia. This is one of the reasons wiki is now loosing it's trust factor. 

I have personally met many agencies who have offered to maintain and boost wiki entries and remove negative post. One even claimed that they could lock posts as they have many accounts that can hold leverage when discussing happen on wiki. 

Edit:typo I think there have been a couple of books written on the Ambanis. One of them is available [here](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=ambani&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def). The other you can find on [*Amazon*](https://www.amazon.in/Ambani-Sons-Hamish-McDonald-ebook/dp/B00MXSAGBA/). There's also one by Paranjoy Guha Thakurta [here](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=Paranjoy+Guha+Thakurta&column=author). Read them and start making your contributions. 1,000 Crore defamation suit incoming! This needs more visibility. This should reach white man Reddit for you to get any solid reach on the topic Wiki pages are being rampantly edited by RW and status quo aristocracy. Even in page of hemant karkare the case of his death was edited and the RSS angle mellowed out , if not totally deleted.  (Edit: Apologies for the long response, but you might find it helpful) As a semi-frequent contributor on Wikipedia, I get your frustration, but I think you have it somewhat wrong, for a few reasons:

1. The Mukesh Ambani page is not actually locked, it is only semi-protected so that more trusted users can edit it.  It may appear to be 'locked' to you if you are not an auto-confirmed user.   But I don't even edit THAT much, and I can access that page because I am auto-confirmed.  The guidelines state that to become autoconfirmed, doesn't take that much effort:*""...most English Wikipedia user accounts that are more than four days old and have made at least 10 edits (including deleted ones) are considered autoconfirmed.""*  Basically when admins semi-protect a page, it is just a safeguard against vandals who cherry-pick pages and don't even really contribute to Wikipedia.  These people don't even have active accounts because if they did, they would be given 'blocked' tags quickly and punished until they proved themselves not to be disruptive.

2. You stated:  *In instances where an article is repeatedly vandalized or at constant risk of vandalization, it can be expected to be ""locked"" from edits that are not approved by a higher power.*  This is also not completely true.  For example, if I wanted to, I could make edits right now to the Ambani page without needing any sort of approval from an editor, and as long as the edit was neutral and well-sourced, it would stay there unless it was challenged for good reason from an other editor.  I could even create a 'controversy' section if I wanted to, again, as long as the info was unbiased and presented fairly.  And you can too, once you become autoconfirmed with 10+edits and an account older than 4 days.  ""Higher Power"" does not mean that certain editors act as a safeguard over specific articles and can cherry-pick what is accepted; that's not how it works at all- anyone can freely add info and it will not be removed as long as it is well-documented.  You are right that Wikipedia is an 'open ledger of information' - for example, Vikas Bahl, the ousted producer, cannot just delete his name from the Me Too (India) Wikipedia page, because it is well-sourced - nor could he 'pay' Wikipedia to do so (unlike, I'm guessing, Facebook or Twitter).


3. You also said: *To get an edit made through a semi-protected article, you need to propose an edit on its talk page.*  Again, this is not totally true - it may be the case if you are not autoconfirmed, but if you are, then you are free to edit directly.  In fact, some articles for films (esp. Bollywood films) are semi-protected, like [Thugs of Hindostan,](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thugs_of_Hindostan&action=edit)
[or the upcoming Kedarnath movie.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kedarnath_(film)
And yet I have been editing both with no problems nor needing to go through the talk pages.  Talk pages are only really used for disputes or to address presentation issues, typically between a few users and an admin, and are often used as a last resort if conflicts can't be solved on the edit page or on the users' own talk pages.

So yea it's not all what it seems to be.  I feel sympathetic to you because I remember being a beginning editor myself and feeling that the odds are kind of stacked against you. You keep editing and trying, and you often don't get the formatting quite right, or don't source properly, etc. And when you make an honest mistake, admins can at times be overly abrupt and rude because they deal with many instances like that in a day, or because they deal with plenty of stubborn beginners that have taught them that being direct is the best policy.  Not all are like that, most are friendly, but it still takes getting used to for a beginner sometimes.  For me, it has all been through trial and error - moments of frustration at thinking it's ""all unfair"" and then eventually seeing that yes, some of it is, but a lot of the rules do help a lot. It is true that Wikipedia now has pretty strict guidelines for editing and has administrators (who basically are advanced users who have been using Wikipedia for years and know its policies inside out) who keep most of the tabs on vandalism, editing errors, etc.  In short, yes there can be a bit of a 'red-tape' feeling if you're just a beginner contributor.  But if you keep at it, you might see (like I did), that the rules and guidelines are helpful and there for a reason, and for the most part are fair and impartial.  

For example, early on I tried to change the top page pictures for articles on some famous actors because I thought the pics were either too old or not good-looking enough.  So I changed a few pages, only to find all the changes reverted by an admin; I was lightly lectured on the copyright laws on Wikipedia and how non-free pictures need to be uploaded by the initial user to Wikipedia Commons, or else the non-free picture must be implied to have a Fair Use as per public domain, like movie posters, etc.  It was only after trial and error that I really got to know how and when to upload properly, and why the rules were like that.  

This is just one example, there are other times where I nearly pulled my hair out just trying to learn and disagreeing with other editors.  But I find that for the most part, everyone does things with a mind for neutrality.  Of course, it's not easy when ANYONE can change their mind or type what they want- so it's tricky at times, and yes I'll admit that I don't always agree with them.  But I think by and large the 'governization' of Wikipedia is more helpful than not.  If you keep at it, you'll find it rewarding as time goes on, I bet. Hmm. Gotta check the deep wiki. Good question. Been a long time and frequent editor on Wikipedia. If the matter is based on reliable sources, then nobody can stop someone from adding such a section, though you’ll have to be careful in your wording as matter will be removed if it even appears borderline attack page/section.",AskIndia,2018-11-25 02:37:17

[AskIndia] What is the most unethical HR practice in your organisation?,112,9jdplh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9jdplh/askindia_what_is_the_most_unethical_hr_practice/,183,,InsomniacNimrod," Note sure if it was a Practice. So this happened to me after a Joined a well know IT company now my former organization, which prides its self to be ""ethical"". 

I was already employed when a had attended an interview with this company, After I was selected post interviews, I was asked to submit previous experience related documents, so that HR could prepare a compensation package. After submitting my documents to them, they took approximately a month and gave me an offer letter, which I accepted. I informed them of my notice period at that time to which they agreed. On completion of my notice period, I joined this company. The first day was induction, which went of fine. So far everything seemed good. On the second day during the orientation program, during the break HR asked me to meet them. There I was informed that ""we checked your documents again and it seems that there was a mistake in calculating your experience, so we are going to reduce the offer we had made"" Then they gave me two options, I accept the revised reduced compensation OR If its not OK I can leave.

I told them their new deal was not only unacceptable, but was also unethical. Since they had a more than a month to verify the documents and release the offer, it was not my fault but theirs. Also objected to the tone in which they said to take the revised deal or leave, as I had already left my previous job, and they could not just leave anyone high and dry. Since I was already a part of the organization now, I would not accept it, and told will definitely escalate this. Thankfully was able to get it escalated and the original offer stood. Still it left a bad taste. Just wondering how many other faced this situation there.

Update: As someone mentioned, I guess this was a screwup by someone in the intake team and they were trying to retrospectively  fix their error. I didn't have to actually escalate it, like in writing and inquiry stuff, spoke to the HR manager in charge, and was told they would look into it. Probably in the background they must have let it stand. Don't think it was an organizational policy, so naming the company may not be appropriate. &#x200B;

Pretty much every other startup in India and primarily those run by heads/management comprising of Indians (or even Indian origin)  have

4. Only role of HR - organizing friday cake party (with only one cake for 150 people) or holding rangoli competitions via fun teams (obligatory mention: sanjay rajoura speaking of 'fun commandos')
5. Never ever speak to anyone in the org about the working environment
6. Always tracking butt in seat time of employees
7. Snooping on conversations between employees
8. Offer baiting - Bait one with a larger CTC , only to change terms on joining day
9. Not paying dues on time. Making final settlement a hopeless saga
10. Never trying to grow a spine to help employees but always siding with the management whatever shit be the reason
11. 'Flexible' leave policy

Not all these are true for many mid-sized and large firms. For startups, most of it is true. The chutiyapa called ""sandwich system"" of marking leaves... There is this IT company in Chennai , which boasts of being ethical and product company. The HR have setup a rule to put on a tie on every monday. So one monday i forgot to wear the tie. The Head HR comes to me and says nothing but takes my Employee ID. I was like why did she ask that at first. But realised its the Tie and nothing else. Then next day she calls me and tells to come to a meeting room. When i entered the Room , there was HR and other employees who had not wore tie the last day. Now they are telling us that we will be suspended for 3 days for not wearing tie and pay will be cut. I was like what man are u serious. I told them, to make people known about the rule that there is a suspension for 3 days for not wearing tie is not to first suspend but you could have mailed about the rule which was not mentioned anywhere . Then they said we have orders from above . I was like dont give silly reasons when u have none. Then i took 3 days suspension and my friends still laugh while looking back on those days. God save the people of those who are still there.I got lucky and got out. My previous organisation had 3 month notice period. So people were leaving as and when they get an offer without serving NP. The MD/HR implemented a policy to deduct 25% of salary for 6 months consecutively or submit the original degree certificate and passport which will be released on the last working day. Mofo even claimed he consulted his lawyer and was legal.

One girl who was with the company for 3 years left without serving NP and in BG verification call he gave negative feedback going so far to saying she is a fraud. Essentially ruined her career. 

Edit:

Another policy is to hire 2-3 employees for support which can be done by someone who completed school. But MD picks Engineering candidates who are Freshers or struggling to find a real job. After joining the offer/appointment letter will be delayed stating silly reasons. He will monitor them for a week or 2 and terminate all but 1 who is good at buttering. 

I hate him with a passion.  At my previous employer in Saudi Arabia the HR passport officer and accounts officer (both of them were Indians) had formed an alliance where they would demand bribes in order to get things done. 
For example, cash or dinner at a fancy restaurant for their families in order to release my vacation salary, cash to get visas stamped, cash to get residence permit renewed on time, cash to get profession changed on residence permit etc.
 Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with Bruce Meyers in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates, and HR doesn't give a shit. i have to clock 9 hours a day, which is okay for me.

but it comes with a clause, i have to punch in before 10:01 AM. even a second later is a half-day. 

for a half-day is compensated by reducing a full-day from the leaves balance. what math. Don't think it's unethical but it was definitely toxic.

The CEO asked this to the sales head during a team meeting of all department heads:

""What is your firing target?""

Everyone was confused what he meant. So he explained:

""Sales team should not spend too much money on salespeople. To keep the team lean, you should keep hiring and firing people till you get the right balance. They will not work if there is no fear of getting fired.""

 The organization has an employee referral program but the HR just fuckin wouldn't hire your candidate. They'll everything to reject it and hire through the HR agencies they work with. No wonder why.. A famous MNC , having multiple offices around Bangalore. One of my friend asked for a release from a project she was tagged in, because she stayed really far from Whitefield, and also had to take care of her mother. She almost traveled 60 KMs daily. When she approached the HR, he was like ""Okay, I'll release you, but I'll make sure you'll get tagged to a project in Delhi/Kolkata"", which made no fucking sense. HRs in this company are a total mess. [deleted] Ours is a vast organisation and there is a high chance you all have interacted with it at least once. My narcissistic CEO wants to handle everything himself, every department from Finance to publicity to foreign relations. Due to this idiotic and entirely stupid nature none of his ""major economic overhaul"" ideas work and fall completely flat but the thing is when stakeholders start demanding for explanation that trash of a person never ever comes forward or talk to them, instead he starts sending his juniors to respond and that *dharti ka bojh* is so *lallu* that he sends Finance manager to a advertisement meet, Transportation Incharge to HR meet.

Recently the CEO and his minions were caught to in some shady dealings but that little shit is still not responding to stakeholders and is sending his minions to start the blame game on competitors. I think I should resign from this company because I've no doubt if CEO is not booted out from the company along with his minions no one can stop it from crash, and instead join other comapny but I've spent 30 years in this organisation and have no where else to go. Bhaiyon aur bahanon, aap logon ke Private Organisation ke utpidan ko dekh ke lagta hai mai Central government me comparatively kam salary me hi thik hun. Dhanyawad. My experience with a previous organization - giving cookie cutter fake resume to clients, inflating years of experience, keeping on billing the client for people who have left the company. And baiting new joiners with certain terms of employment but switching as soon as they join.

Another organization tried to cut off the HR consultant after successful recruitment with their help.

Working husband and unemployed wife - good hikes 
Working husband , unemployed wife with kids - qualifies for even better hikes 
Working husband , employed wife but wife doesn’t have a well paid job - decent hike 
Working husband, employed wife with wife in a IT job - not so great hike ( why do they need money ,  both of them working anyways)  Reading all these comments, I feel lucky for working in my organisation. The H.R. is one much better than what we could have asked for.",AskIndia,2018-09-27 23:13:42
[AskIndia] I found out that one of my friends is an Heroin addict. How can I help,69,a8ipdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a8ipdj/askindia_i_found_out_that_one_of_my_friends_is_an/,32,"I received the information that he has become addicted to Heroin and Tramadol. He also mentions that one of his veins broke; can't recollect it now but it appears to be one of the major veins that starts from thigh and runs all the way down the leg. I don't know anything about what I've written. I am just an occasional user of weed, mostly home grown in my backyard.

I've received this information about him in an email. He's a long lost friend of mine, a good one and he reached out to me as it appears he's all alone now and even his family disowned him.

I am planning to meet him in person shortly and see what I can do. Can you guys help me?

First time I've joined this sub, I do remember seeing de-addiction section on the right but I don't now. Can you guys tell me what it entails? Hospitals/Rehabilitation centers, duration of treatment, approximate costs. It would help if it's in WB OR AP (Vishakhapatnam/Hyd/Vijaywada/Tirupati or even Chennai).

I've seen in one of the episodes of ""Homeland"" the protagonist is administered an African herb called ""Ibogaine"" and according to the show he was able to recuperate quickly. Any information on this also helps. I am mostly planing to bring him to me through the treatment unless he has any specific objection. If possible I am not averse to flying him to any place (i.e. if it's in Africa) that can offer some radical treatment.

Am a bit short on time atm. Need to run few errands. Can you guys help in anyway of information? Thanks.",UUUU__UUUU," heroine addicts are too dangerous to handle when they dont receive their dose. be careful. there should be rehabs in Vizagapatam and it is best to meet a psychologist for the same. Take him to a rehab center. Heroin isn't an ""aadat""; you need professionals to de addict [deleted] Go to a psychiatrist asap and then check him into a deaddiction center. Stay away from private ones as they often unlawfully detain patients and use torture. Also since you are not a family member it might be difficult for you to seek treatment for him. It would be better if he has a family member to accompany him. Consent for treatment has to come from him unless court mandated.

Good luck I don't know your education qualification. And if it's not doctor, please do not try to use any of the alternate medicines. Specially **Ibogaine** it's an hallucinogen and psychoactive. If you don't know what other drugs, he has taken it could do non-reversable damage to him. Yes Ibogaine has some deaddiction properties, but for that you need someone with proper training to administer it. 

Here's are the few steps you can take now:

1. Contact Doctor if government hospital, it would be best. (Other redditer or Doctor from here can help)

2. Inform his family.

3. Do not try to handdle this situation alone, take someone with you. As addict tend to get violent and emotional. 

4. Do not be a doctor and give anything that is suggested on internet. 

5. Tell everything to doctor. Tell doctor what kind of coktail he is taking, as well as how much dosage and duratin he has been taking.

Like others has said. Don't give money:



P.S- Keep us updated.

Edit: Formatting Like any addiction. Most of the addictive behavior is due to social problems. With Heroin it's a bit different but still the same. However the potency of heroin to hock users is very strong. What your friend needs is a safe and welcoming environment, people to talk to, a job to keep him occupied, He needs to be placed under constant supervision. Build trust with him. Consult a doctor to get him on buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone. If you want to help him be there for him most addicts start using because they see no hope in real life and Heroin becomes a good escape. The euphoric high they get is something that will keep forcing the person to go back aka chasing the dragon, hence he needs to be occupied all the time. Most heroin addicts will relapse if left alone so get him surrounded with people people who don't talk about using heroin. 

It is very tasking if you take up this job but as a true friend you should reassure him that if he is willing to quit you will stand by him always.  https://deaddictioncentres.in/rehabcentre/green-valley-foundation/

Check above site and maybe call some of them to find out what they have. I heard about Ibogaine in some podcasts (Joe Rogan/Aubrey Marcus), I think there are some centers in Mexico but no idea about anything in Africa.  >veins broke

Not an issue, it is manageable.

>family disowned him

Most probably because he asked them again and again for money, and eventually they had to disown him.

>deaddiction

What is basically done is, that the patient is given weak opioids which prevent full withdrawal and then these are tapered off. This can't be done with heroin, other stuff is used. And also in the meantime the patient is kept somewhere he can't get cocaine/heroine.

>ibogaine

No such thing in this world. There's nalaxone, which is used to save lives in case of acute heroine overdose, and naltrexone, used to help in rehab.

Also your friend may need good nutrition, addicts don't eat well.

  
 Asha Hospital in Hyderabad is an option, it’s a psychiatric hospital also help with addictions. We admitted my cousin there for some mental help, and I’ve seen their facilities, they looked impressive. Maybe call them and check.  this reminds me the plot of 'resolution'. Same scenario to be honest.

I hope your friend gets well though. Uska dealer kon hai Radical treatment centres can be found in Africa.  But they are literally radical and involve physical discipline and borderline torture if not torture. If will probably get him rid of his addiction but he may be scarred.

[Relevant documentary](https://youtu.be/0ArcwczYUGo) Hide away your money and valuables. Take his money and possessions too. Keep him in a cage till withdrawal is over. And never let him near /alone with anything worth money.  OP watch this

[AskIndia] Multilingual people of r/India: What do you think is the easiest and most difficult Indian language to learn?,25,a79xl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a79xl0/askindia_multilingual_people_of_rindia_what_do/,45,"Saw that post by the white girl and I thought I'd ask.


I understand that most of us will only speak languages spoken in our states, but I'm sure there are some of us that have more different perspective.",CaptainPoverty," Mallu here... Can speak hindi, marathi, bengali and telugu.

Malayalam and Tamil are very difficult. Marathi would be relatively easier for a native Hindi speaker - very close alphabets, almost the same. I am reasonably fluent with Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Hindi. So I can reasonably follow a conversation in most parts of India. Except Kerala. Malayalam is somehow beyond my reach. Native Bengali speaker here. Can understand spoken Odia without any issues, clueless on the written part. Assamese shares the same script as Bengali, so can understand written Assamese. Spoken Assamese is pretty hard to follow for me. I'd say these two will be the easiest languages for a Bengali to learn. Due to substantial exposure from North Indian immgrants, knowledge of Hindi is pretty common too. 

The languages I'm fluent in, in the order of fluency are Bengali, English, Hindi. Can speak Kannada, Tamil, Telugu & Hindi. Also can understand Malayalam, which is definitely the most difficult to learn. Easiest can be a bit of miss or hit. Its easier for Kannadigas to learn Telugu and Tamilians to learn Malayalam and vice-versa. Easiest Gujarati. Most of us have a fair bit of idea already and it is similar to Hindi. 

According to pronunciation, as far as my knowledge goes Marathi is the toughest. Some of the letters are unique to it (even though it shares most of Devanagari with Hindi)


PS I speak Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati and English. And a little bit of Spanish  Odia here. Grew up in north India and find Hindi to be the easiest one. Can understand and read Bengali fluently without having put any effort. Pretty okay when it comes to speaking. Can understand a bit ofTamil and I think ot is the hardest one though there is still a lot of sanskrit in there tamil, its a totally different family language, if you learn hindi other north indian languages should not be too difficult Santhali, Kurukh, Ho, Khasi. It really depends on what languages you already speak. If you're fluent in an Indo-European language, it will be easier to pick up other Indo-European languages than it will be to pick up a Dravidian language. And vice versa. 

For instance, the most common challenge for native speakers of Dravidian languages is that Hindi does not have a neutral gender. Everything is male or female. Plus, verbs change based on the object's gender. It takes a lot of rewiring to get used to that. I speak Punjabi, hindi, bengali, telegu, English, French, and marwadi. Easiest to learn for me was Marwadi (school friends) and hardest was Telegu.  Native Tamil/Telugu Can speak German Kannada 
The only way to learn or speak Tamil fluently is by studying it at school or relegiously learning it an institute. Else it’s a hard language and again if you started working and there is no reason for you to write Tamil. It’s difficult to come back to the writing fluency, cause writing and speaking and literally two differing languages. All of them are difficult! If you picked them up as a child, it's fairly easier. As an adult, learning a new language sometimes puts the brain in an overdrive. Why do many find Malayalam difficult? It doesn't even have conjugations unlike other Dravidian languages. Ex-Moose here who was born in North India. I understand and speak Hindi and Urdu and can read both of them but cannot write Urdu because of lack of practice. If I practice enough, I will be able to do that. To make even worse, my Urdu vocabulary is non-existent.  


My neighbors were Bengalis and I don't feel Bengali is tough enough to not understand if you know Hindi/Urdu. Same with Marathi as one of my roommate was Marathi in the first year of engineering.  


Also. I spent 4 years in South India and didn't learn any Dravidian language. They are tough but my ignorance to learn the language was the main barrier for not learning it.",AskIndia,2018-12-18 18:28:44

I need an athletic kind of body  rather than a buffed up. Many of my friends have been to gym for the past 1-2 years, within 3-4 months their muscles were visible and they looked strong and all but now they all look like uncle with tummy , [adarak jaise phel gaye]. They can't run for shit. They have really low stamina(one of them was a football/basketball player.) 
I am lean but I don't want to buff up, I just need to look kind of fit and strong.


Some of my friends suggested that increasing weight while lifting up increases strength , whereas increasing reps increases muscles. Is it true?


Also what kind of diet should I depend on. I live in hostel and don't have access to boiled milk(I drink packet milk). Should I add creatine and caffeine (pre gym) to my diet? I can eat non-veg diet (already eating 3 egg whites/day). 


Sorry if I sound stupid. 


PS : i have great stamina, have been running >10 km marathons since early teens.",Bee2Pee2," Peanut butter!!!!!  
>I am lean but I don't want to buff up, I just need to look kind of fit and strong.


You've to buff up a little atleast to look fit and strong as you're skinny now. Eat healthy high protein food at caloric surplus and workout for lean gain. 

>Some of my friends suggested that increasing weight while lifting up increases strength , whereas increasing reps increases muscles. Is it true?

Partly yes. But increasing weight also builds muscle and increasing rep also builds strength. What you need to do have is a progressive overload in terms of weight ideally. It's better to use a popular workout routine. Checkout info of r/fitness - PPL is good for beginners. 


>Also what kind of diet should I depend on. I live in hostel and don't have access to boiled milk(I drink packet milk). Should I add creatine and caffeine (pre gym) to my diet? I can eat non-veg diet (already eating 3 egg whites/day). 

Just workout for 3 months without creatine and see how your body responds, since you don't have a big target, you should be fine without creatine. Use creatine if you're not satisfied with your results. You can use caffeine as pre workout but again not completely necessary.

You can drink pasteurised milk directly from the packet, you don't have to boil it. Drink atleast a litre. Since you are in hostel, it's better to buy whey protein supplement to meet your protein requirement, and eat atleast 6 whole egg. Read FAQ in r/fitness 
 Buffing doesn't equate to strength. Start small and try building strength by combining different exercises. Muscles will soon develop as a by-product.  You need to build more muscle mass. Reduce the cardio to minimal and concentrate on strength training. Eat more protein and reduce the carbs.  Read the wiki on /r/fitness For me, doing calisthenics like push-ups / chin-ups make me stronger and doesn't make me bulk up. Weight training like bench presses always makes me bulk up. However YMMV. /r/gainit  Watch AthleanX's videos on YouTube. Listen dude, the buffed up body doesn't happen by accident. You'll not ""buff up"" galti se. Unless your idea of buffing up is Cristiano Ronaldo. Gaining a lot of muscle requires a lot of time, calculation,good, if not great, genetics and money. Most actors skip the steps and do steroids, like instagram models. 

That being said, you'll gain some amount of muscle. Especially as a beginner, your rate fo muscle gain is higher than people who've been working out for a while. After time there's only so much you can lift without breaking your back or something, and progressive overload gets harder to achieve. 

Let's talk muscle. As I mentioned progressive overload. I'm assuming your muscle building genetics are average (we'll find out eventually). Progressive overload is, as the name suggests, progression of load on your body, specifically muscles. Basically, the heavier you lift, the more muscle you'll gain.(that's not the only way) There's volume, intensity, and weight. Volume is the number of sets you'll do, intensity is the amount of rest you take between sets, and weight is well, weight. Progressive overload is directly proportional to volume and weight and inversely with intensity. Lift more weight more often, spend less time between sets.

Now, that's the basics, let's get into what you really need to do. What's the best way to increase progressive overload? Weight. Weight is easier to change among those three factors. So, best excercise you can increase weights in? Compound excercises. Squats, deadlifts, bench press, rows, overhead press. These excercises build muscle. No, seriously, there are entire programs out there that only include these, and people can still gain a amazing physique. You have to do these excercises, to gain muscle. Are they the only way? No. You can do non compound excercises, like bicep curls, or tricep pushdowns. Are they best? Yes. Deadlifts target pretty much all your body(except for maybe chest and shoulders). Squats target your legs, all of it. Even abs, they're important to not break your back.

So, done with gym. Do compound excercises, you'll be really exhausted if you do it right. If you still want to focus on some body parts that you specifically want to grow larger, do isolation for them. Remember, compound excercises, if not done right with heavy weight, will cause imbalances. 

Now, nutrition. Eat protein. That's it. Nah just kidding, start tracking your calories. Use something like myfitnesspal and make sure you reach your calorie and protein goals everyday. Everything else will just come in your diet probably(Micronutrients are important, eat your veggies). Find out your maintenance calories, this is the amount of calories your body burns everyday. Now increase it by 250-500, not too much, too fast. Too much too fast will make sure you'll end up being fat instead of athletic. Too less too fast means you'll lose muscle before fat, therefore end up being skinny fat.

That's pretty much it. Oh and sleep and stress and shit. I'll let you take care of that.",AskIndia,2019-02-16 11:04:08

EDIT: Thanks, guys! Will sit down for an hour or so sometime over this weekend and come up with a post.",southkasanta," super interested I have worked on the backend of an UPI application. 
Trust me, It was really an amazing to project on. Lots to learn. 

Entire ecosystem looks something like this:
Mobile 1 (bank1 app)  <- - > PSP(bank1's payment service provider) <- - > NPCI(gov entity) <- - > PSP(bank2's payment service provider)  <- - > Mobile 2(bank2 app)

To make a transaction happens there are more than 8  hops but it is still too fast. Session management is another important use-case. Once you are signed in to your bank on one phone, you can not sign in into same app through different phone. 

You can download and read the documents from NPCI website. 


 Are you talking about, like YouTube videos and stuff? Go for it.  Also please cover some of the smart card technology of credit cards and how it enhances security. If possible also touch upon Contactless cards.

I would also be interested in card not present transactions and how they are enabled. Here. Have a basic knowledge but would love to know more If you can put a small paragraph on IMPS, NEFT and RTGS for comparing their background mechanisms that would be great too. Chaliye shuru karte hai I haven't used UPI and don't know why we have so many digital payment modes. The BSNL payment portal for example has like 10 different options. How does the layman figure out which one benefits him? yes please definitely interested

&#x200B; Definitely would love to know about it.  yyaa Yes! Yes!!  Yes Absolutely! Very much interested. I don't know anything about it and haven't even used it yet. YESS!!!  Hell yeah! Goddamn. Definitely interested  I am really interested to know how foreign transactions work. Can you an AMA? Or can I DM some questions to you which you can answer?  Hi i am super interested, especially how foreign transactions work. I work as a tech lawyer and do a lot of work on digital payments.  Yes, please.
A write up would be a good way.  If I remember right, its something like.

Client -> NPCI -> [BankCreditor, BankCreditee]

So, when you make a request to transfer money, NPCI makes a call to validate the 2 accounts (or maybe it already has that context, not sure), and then pulls money from source account, then transfers that to the destination account.

Although it doesn't seem like much, know that there are very few countries with such a system in place. Most countries have some systems (which are plagued by a lot of crap) usually bank-bank partnerships / or some private entity that tries to partner with a large number of banks. This is because quite a few (or rather most) of banking systems are still in paper tech / or massive data dumps that just lie there. And apart from this, the APIs of each banks tend to follow very different schemes, hence implementing systems that actually tackle all of them is quite hard. There are large agreements between many banks etc. (I think Bank of America has a pretty big one), then there are private players who do the same (I think wonga from UK has one), and then there are a few examples of centralised ones (Example: China). There are also a few countries where there is pretty much one defacto bank, so it kinda works out for most people like that etc.

PS: One important thing to note that the ledger adjustments and actual money transfer also happens instantaneously. Its not like it is adjusted by NPCI at the end of the day or something like that.

The fact that a government entity managed to do the same, and in a really quick and secure manner, is something to actually be proud of.

There was supposed to have been a V2 of this (which actually came, but is considered a failure because the feature list that it initially promised for V2 were not part of it). But once the actual features of the V2 ( I think it related to stuff like allowing companies to ping via UPI directly, automatic repayments / mandate collections via UPI etc.) That will be a massive power-play which will have a major impact. Yes please! YES!! 

Some questions about CC and DC.

1. https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/21168/how-does-amazon-bill-me-without-the-cvc-cvv-cvv2  How/Why is that ^ possible? Is it possible to do so in India?


2. I have seen that Amazon and other companies take it upon themselves to save our card information to ""make our lives easier"". They also take the CVV. Why are they allowed to do that?

3. A friend told me that cross-border card transactions are a different level of evil altogether. Could you elaborate on this?

4. I have seen multiple people who have no idea about their liabilities that they have for any fraudulent debit or credit card transaction. Where does one learn and manage the situations where shit hits the fan.

-------

On UPI:

UPI has made our lives easier. We don't have to share or make mistakes while sharing the bank account no., IFSC for transactions. I think the most important factor is there's no need for using the failure-prone SMS-based 2FA while conducting UPI transactions. 

Billdesk or ICICI have got one feature related to UPI that I really really like. I wish razorpay, instamojo picked up on that feature. I will add a screenshot here to better explain it).


Coming to the bad/hidden pitfalls of UPI:

1. Grievance Redressal for UPI transactions is shit.

2. The problem of including 3rd party companies is that every transaction is being watched. Further these companies share data or can share data with other companies, sometimes with your permission (PhonePe - Ola). The problem here is most end-users are unaware of the consequences of such data sharing.

3. While an end-user (with multiple bank accounts behind a single VPA on a single app) can select which account he wants to spend the money from but if he receives the money, it is received automatically in the default bank account set in the app. This makes it difficult for the user to separate different bank accounts for separate purposes. Only workaround is to have separate bank accounts on different UPI apps. Is there any idea/plan to allow separate UPI VPAs for different accounts in one app?

4. UPI at this time does not allow/support registered mobile number changes, ie, if you change your phone number registered with the bank account(for which you have a registered VPA on an UPI app) and you want to change the number on the UPI app as well, you won't be able to do so. UPI by design(confirmed by NPCI's twitter account) does not allow the UPI App to change the number. So you have to create a new UPI account with the new mobile number. So all your transaction records will be lost. While transaction records are mirrored in your bank statements, its very hard to discern the mobile, DTH, electricity recharges that you might have done using the UPI app. Also many a times some part fo the recharges are paid by discounts or wallet cash, this adds an additional layer of grunt work while accounting.

5. I have seen that companies like Uber and Ola being on the fence for including UPI payments on their app. Uber initially opened UPI baed payments on the app but then they took it down and now you can't link your UPI VPA to your uber account anymore. I read that these guys were waiting for auto-withdrawal to be enabled in UPI2.0. Also UPI has a lot of failed transactions for cab-payments and the redressal mechanism isn't top notch and some people have been asked to pay twice by mistake. Why does UPI suck so much for time-critical payments like cabs, food deliveries, etc.?

 Please make this happen!! Yes please !! Awesome! Just what I was looking for? I wanted to know more about VPA and are there any limits on how many VPA can be created for an account. Is it possible to create disposable VPA intended for a single transaction? (like in bitcoin)?  I love UPI and would definitely like to know about the internals. RemindMe! 1 week Great initiative, I have always been fascinated by it. 
I mean the amount of transactions it supports,the speed, interoperability, simplicity etc. Is it going to be a major threat to cc and dc companies ? 
Also how costly or cheaper is it than other modes of payment ? Why is there no other system like it in other parts of the world ? Is it that tough to do so ? 
Also what are companies like phone pe and paytm doing in this ? I mean apart from interface what are their contributing ? Yes  Nice! I am interested

RemindME! 1 week ""UPI payment"" PhonePe ? tag me pls RemindMe! 2 days Would love to know more!! It was actually in my mind for a month. Would like to know. I don't like the confusing multiple UPI ids thing though due to multiple UPI apps.

I envy Google Pay/Tez as it has taken the credit of much of the UPI really, at least in the view of an average person, not Bhim or UPI. What do you think of this?

I also think they should've mandated a single UPI id for a single bank account in a non App agnostic way. Sometimes people ask me if I have Tez, I used to tell them I don't but I have Bhim and they can send to it from Tez. Some people don't understand, some people just don't do because they would miss out offers :) Yes please How do I hack UPI? Not interested at all Yeah no. Thanks anyways.",AskIndia,2018-10-27 04:48:01

Maybe she is EFGH Send her a text saying your parents gave you her number, and say ‘hi’. Most probably her parents too briefed her on you.

* UK - Brexit will cause job losses

* US - Trump's supporters will kill you

* Australia - Racist

* Canada - Not enough money",hiaastha," I can something about US as I have stayed there for 3 years.

&#x200B;

1) College Towns are generally the easiest places to live in in the US. Generally multi-cultural and very easy to stay. 

2) Biggest Con- Real Estate. Depending on where you are moving, you may have to pay an insane amount for rent. 

3) I have travelled extensively in the mid-west and east coast through small towns and big cities and personally I haven't faced any severe form of racism. Stereotyping yes and overall curiousness about the country and its people but nothing severe. 

4) If you are moving anywhere outside the country the biggest advice I can give you is that learn to live like a local and pick up local customs and habits but do not lose your cultural identity in the process.  I have done my college from the States and have worked in Australia for some time, so can share my opinion about these two countries.

1) US  - Getting work authorization in the United States is more difficult now than ever before. The conditions for qualifying for the long term visa grant is now more stringent. That's all.

2) Australia - I didn't face any sort of racism in Australia, either professionally or personally ever. Majority of Australians are friendly blokes. I used to visit a lot of small towns in the outbacks for work related reasons. Such towns have relatively lower literacy rates than the bigger towns such as Brisbane , Sydney etc. But even there I never faced any racism in any form. My guess is media gives to much coverage to negative incidents (such as racism, rapes, lynchings etc.) thus building the negative perception about any country for that matter. 

 I have lived in USA for 15 and a half years now. I live in a deep red (Trump supporting) state. I do not agree with your potrayal of the situation that Trump supporters are out to kill foreigners. I haven't really faced any safety issues after Trump's victory that can be attributed to him winning the election.

Generally speaking in order to move to United States you have three options. 1) come as a student and after finishing your degree, if you can secure a good job move to a work visa and then eventually get a green card. 2) Come to United States on a work visa sponsored by your employer who everyway sponsors your Green card as well. 3) you get a green card through a sponsorship from an immediate family member who is a US citizen. Options 1 and 2 mission before are becoming increasingly difficult to achieve. Part of the problem is the Trump administration has increased the scrutiny of H1B visas manifold. The other problem is there's a tremendous amount of wait time for specifically Indians after the employers sponsor their green card application. Currently it is projected that Indians who applied for green card in 2018 under eb-2 or eb-3 category will have to wait 70-80 years to get the green card. This green card backlog was not created by Trump administration. NZ is nice.  Trump supporters won’t kill you, no such thing is happening. Check out r/askanamerican, this concern has been addressed there.  Japan is good, if you can learn the language. I am a student here. If you keep looking for cons, you will start finding them...


Uk is definitely a no-no if you aren't looking for a very specialized advancement oriented traveller. If you seek advanced knowledge, go uk. But move out for employment.

US, a perspective other than IT crowd is, its not that safe. Gun crime is high. If you own stores, keep gun and pray nobody comes to loot you with gun. Citizenship is next to impossible. 

Canada, students are poaching jobs. Life is bland. And thand... Ufff.

Australia, recently they are refusing visa to relatives left right and centre...

Germany, language is pain in ass.

Italy, too pendu. Poor returns. Also, language.

Spain, cousin to Italy. Decent money.

Belgium, so far lucrative but expensive.

France, good if into highly trained industry. Train to Britannia was gold buy now, London walo ko kaise milne jau? If you have enough money. Monaco is perfect.  Anyone has an idea How is the job scene in Australia like for software engineers ? Are there enough opportunities for them like in India ? Currently I am Living in USA for around 2 years now and honestly it depends on your state and locality. 
Don't go and follow the stereotypes 
Not every rednecks who support trump is a racist 
Not every black hood guy is a bad person 
When someone is creepy you will easily get a vibe. 

In my opinion if you have to move to USA :skip Nevada or Vegas maybe chose reno it's an amazing place 

Orange county if you have money 

Don't think about moving to ny lol

Dallas is mini India

Shipping was on time and the product arrived in India yesterday and ever since then, the status is stuck at ""Held by Customs, please contact the seller or the customs department"".
I contacted the seller and he reassured me by saying ""Please don't worry, everything will be fine"". Yeah, that's some reassurance for me alright.    
I'm not sure about what is going to happen from here. If anyone has ordered something from Aliexpress and faced a similar situation, can they share their experience from which I can gather some sense and then decide what to do next ?

Please let me know if I should be posting this elsewhere. 

I am from Delhi NCR, and live in a posh society. You know, the kind with clubs, swimming pool etc. We are a tenant here and while shifting into this society, we did not take into account the kind of douchebags that live here. 

Anyway, last year I got a dog. (A golden retriever, and he is big now!). Lately my society has been imposing rules which I don't know if they can. 

1. Dogs cannot defecate inside the society premises. (Which if not illegal, I agree is a sanitation issue. However, at night I don't want to take my dog outside where there is no light.) I ALWAYS clean up after my dog when he defecates inside the society premises. (It is still a public place.)

2. ""Keep them off the grass"". I don't understand this rule. Unless my dog is actually harming someone or defecating there, I don't see a reason for this ""rule"". I have seen people with really well behaved dogs (like they (dogs) don't even give a fuck if kids are there, they just mind their own business and follow their owner). They do not keep those dogs on leash in the park, but again, like I said, those dogs are REALLY WELL BEHAVED. My dog isn't like that, so I keep him on leash at all times. But I would like to have a place where he can run around without leash, since dogs like him need a lot of exercise. 

3. Today, I took him outside of the society premises, like I always do during the day, and still the watchman came and told me to take him elsewhere, cause ""they are making a park"" outside the main gate too. This ""park"" is only going to be for the looks, no one is going to use it for anything really. 

So how many of these rules are actually legal and can be imposed on us? Don't I have any rights?

They cannot. 

[Here is a circular](http://www.awbi.org/awbi-pdf/pet_dog_circular_26_2_2015.pdf) from the animal welfare board of India.

Some highlights - 

1. No Resident Welfare Association has the right to ban a resident from keeping pets.

2. This ban cannot be enforced even if a majority of people are in favour of this ban.

3. A ban on a pet cannot be based on invalid reasons like the dog barking.

4. A ban cannot be introduced regarding the size of pets in a society. No discrimination on the ground of size should be promoted.

5. No society by-law or regulation can validate a pet-related ban.
As per the guidelines by Animal Welfare Board of India, any sort of ban on pets is equivalent to direct intrusion with the fundamental independence guaranteed to all the citizens as per the Indian constitution.
A pet or a resident owner who does not violate any municipal law has permission to stay in the housing society. I have no idea about this but i want to see your pupper!

[AskIndia] Tips for a new car driver?,55,a4gqaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a4gqaa/askindia_tips_for_a_new_car_driver/,62,"Bought an used car last week and I'm practicing my driving right now. Can I hear some tips for a new driver like me?

Also, what are some of the helpful accessories that I can get installed to make my driving experience fun and better?

I have a hyundai grand i10 magna (2017 model) if that helps.",dhildo," Since you are starting to drive, please make sure you are aware of your surroundings while driving. The more information you have, the better decisions you can make.

1. Make it a rule to check the mirrors before doing anything. (You know this but might still forget to do it. This should come as an instinct)

2. As one other guy said, use gear2 in intersections and speed breakers.

3. In slopes, while climbing don't increase your gear. Keep it as it is or lower it if need more pulling power at lower speeds. If you're stuck in a slope and need to move up, put 1st gear -> keep clutch point -> then move ( this will make sure your car doesn't come down)

4. In intense traffic, you don't need to use accelerator. In lower gears, keeping clutch point and releasing is enough for your car to move. ( You'll get used to using clutch point)

5. In the beginning, you will feel intimidated to overtake sometimes and get stuck behind vehicles or you'll stop so that someone else can join your lane, when this happens (or not) people behind you will spam horn, please ignore it. Once you get comfortable and confident, you can know your limits to make better decisions.

6. It takes time to get used to your car's dimensions. You won't know how much space to leave infront of your car to not get hit and it'll be difficult to know whether the left extreme of your car may/may not hit something. You need to know where your tires will be also. All these things comes with time no need to pay special attention.

7. Watch videos on what to do in case of emergencies. What to do when someone hits you?
What to do when your break doesn't work?
What to do when your accelerator gets stuck and is infinitely accelerating?
What to do when you got a puncture tire?
How to use your tool kit?
How to start a car when ignition doesn't work and someone has to push from behind?

8. Learn to use your headlights properly. Having high beam will practically blind the guy coming in the opposite lane.

9. Be aware of your left side. Since lot of folks will overtake you in the left (Which is not wrong in dual or tri lanes). People will cut into main road from side road without looking at anything. Be aware of crossroads in highway.

10. Don't make any sudden movements which might make someone else crash into you.

Lot of things are there but everything will come with practice and experience. Four years back my driving instructor told me ""you're worthless and it's no use teaching you to drive"" and here I am driving perfectly fine in all conditions ( intense traffic, crooked roads, highways, hills)

 Some tips from my experience: 

1. Wear your seat belt and make sure everyone in your car wears seat belts, even at the back. It may seem like a simple thing, but can save lives.


2. To practice driving, start out early in the morning (around 6 am) and drive in the city. Make sure you are perfect with driving in the city before you drive on highways. 


3. The most important thing in city driving is stay in the middle lane always. Only before a U-turn, change to the right most lane. So many experienced drivers make this mistake and always drive in the right most lane and suddenly change to middle lane at u-turns, causing traffic jams.


4. Don't be afraid to go out at night. Remember to always use low beams in the city. 90% of drivers use high beams in the city which blinds you at night. If possible, wear anti-glare driving glasses to counter this. 


5. Don't get bullied by tailgaters. People behind you sometimes force you to go faster by tailgating and honking. If you don't want to go fast, change lanes and let them pass. Never get angry at your fellow drivers, be calm. 


6. Always properly adjust your mirrors properly to eliminate blind spots before you drive. Don't set your outside mirrors for getting a rear view, adjust them for a side view. Use the inside mirror for rear view. 


7. Use your indicators even when you change lanes. Even when no one's behind you, don't skip the indicators when you turn. It must become a reflex. 


8. Always be prepared for what could happen in case of a minor or a major accident. Never flee the sight of the accident. If damages are big, go to the police, file FIR and claim your insurance. Don't fight with others. 


9. I don't want to be rude but 2-wheelers are the biggest idiots on roads for car drivers. Most of them don't look while turning and you must be extra careful around them. 

10. There's a rule of precedence for pedestrians. You should always let them cross the road first. 

Some useful car accessories: 

My must have accessories include mobile phone holder (if you use Google maps more), reverse parking sensors (with camera if you want to spend more), fog lights (especially if you live in the North), 12v phone charger, small trash bins that fit in door bottle holders.

Always keep a glass cleaner bottle, some microfiber towels, soapy water in your car. 
Make sure your windshield washer fluid is filled with a proper washer fluid concentrate.

Also buy a dashboard camera and a rapid tyre inflator. These are somewhat expensive but they will pay off every time you use them. 

edit: Tyre pressure is something we usually don't check or pay attention to. Always maintain recommended tyre pressure which can be found inside driver side door jam.
Always inflate your tyres when they are cold. 

Edit 2: Watch all videos in this channel, they helped me a lot. https://www.youtube.com/user/acomvillerayconduite [deleted] Always second gear when turning at intersection. Secret tip from my trainer some 10 years ago. 1. Even when you become a seasoned driver make sure never to overtake at turns. Wait for a straight path before you overtake. I have seen many people commit this mistake and the result is most likely very fatal.

2. If it seems there is a problem with your car, start the hazard lights and slowly keep going towards the left most lane. Whenever you think you are in a position where your car is a danger to you and others. Use hazard lights.

3. In India you will have to specially take care of bikers. They can emerge from anywhere. Also, if you feel there is enough space for two wheelers let them go else don't give them enough space.

4. Keep distance from trucks and never drive behind them if you have to maintain a larger distance then usual.

5. Don't accelerate very fast specially in traffic. Many a times such fast acceleration will lead to you bumping into the one infront of you or the one behind you will bump into you.

6. Invest in a dashcam.
 The following diagram shows two vehicles A and B. Traffic flow is from
the left of the picture to the right.

                                   Traffic Flow ->
       ===============================================
				  +------------+
				  |     A      |
				  |            |
				  +------------+
	    +---------+
	    |    B    |
	    +---------+
       ===============================================

You are the driver of B.
A is some other vehicle, and is stationary for whatever reason.

In this situation, do NOT pass A at full speed. Slow down and turn your head to the left to look for pedestrians crossing the road in front of A. Because of A, they would not have seen you before starting to cross the road, and many of them believe that the road is safe for crossing and do so with full speed and confidence.
 Always honk the hon on a blind curve. India is the land of morons who will try to overtake on blind curves. Also there are certain road etiquettes which you must know - [Team BHP](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/64236-road-etiquette-how-not-drive.html). Also learn what to do when somebody hits your car. If you drive in hilly areas, there are other [Rules](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/technical-stuff/13595-tips-required-hill-driving.html). Keep safety as your number one priority, always wear seatbelts. Just one advice, don't use high beams unnecessarily, and in cities they are not even needed mostly. I know how many times I have been blinded and have escaped accidents just because of this simple thing. Don't know exactly how comfortable you are. Here are some tips for beginners on Indian roads including some unconventional one.

1. On city streets, the *middle* lane is best. The left most lane is typically packed with parked cars, pedestrians, slow moving cycles etc. OTOH others can overtake you on the right lane.

2. On 4 lane street, drive **on** the center line. Forget about lane rules. There aren't any.

3. Never, ever take a turn from the middle lane/middle of the road. When you know there is a turn coming, get to the closest lane first. If you take a turn from one lane across (either to the left or right) someone is **guaranteed to crash into you**. 

4. Try to drive straight in a line. When you reach someone blocking you, no sudden turn. No sudden *movement* even in your own lane. Slow down. Check mirrors. Turn signal on. Then change lane.

5. The power of the 'L' marker. No one will blame you if you drive slowly in your lane. In fact others will appreciate it. Don't worry. As long as there is space, others will overtake you. They may honk once or twice. Don't bother. Of course you will be overtaken on both sides. So to repeat point 4, no sudden turn.

6. Just because you have turn signals on, doesn't mean you can swiftly change lanes. Change lanes slowly. So that anyone behind you get's some time to react.

7. On bumper to bumper traffic, where you are moving only by 1 meter per move, you don't need the accelerator. Keep in first gear. Just slightly release the clutch. The car will start moving. Hold the clutch again cut power to the wheels.

8. Practice parking. You will need some time to get a feeling of your cars size. See how close you can park to the curb. 

9. When parked, don't suddenly open your door. A cyclist will come out of nowhere and bump into your open door. Again, mirrors.

10. Practice hill start. Find a stretch of road that has a mild slope. Stop on the middle of the slope going uphill. Then start moving again without backsliding too much. You will **have to** learn this. 

11. Practice in wide city streets. Don't be afraid. Go in the early morning. Don't practice in narrow lanes near your house. Those are way more difficult for beginners.

12. I am not going into highway driving right now. Among accessories, parking cameras and mobile holders are nice. And an aux cable.

 First dont be on reddit if you are driving.. No blind overtakes = Multiple lives saved. 10 feet from next car upto 25 kmph
15 feet upto 40 kmph
20 feet upto 60 kmph 

Okay I made up those numbers but you get the gist... The distance between you and the vehicle you follow should increase with speed and the size of vehicle in front. Find open places near you to practice.

Feet should be position so that your heal is placed at the brake and you angle it sideways to accelerate. Your impulse reaction would be braking a d not accelerating.

Practice driving backwards it is something that takes most time to perfect and also helps you in parking once you have mastered it.

Understand the use of all the car mirrors. Mainly focus on various blind corners (behind the tail lights).

Try to gently move into a gear with your stick shift rather than forcing into a gear. Your gear box will remain fine.

Other things shall come with practice which won't be a prob coz you will drive a lot.  There are plenty of idiots on the road. Don't become one of them. Always be courteous and respectful of others on the road, even if you happen to cross paths with an a** hole. One day, someone else will return your respect and that day you will be thankful for being a gentleman. Follow best practices on the road and keep yourself, your family and others safe. Always remember driving a car does not make you invincible. Go through the Q & A in the following link:

[http://transport.telangana.gov.in/html/llr-question-bank.html](http://transport.telangana.gov.in/html/llr-question-bank.html)  1. Beware of 2 wheelers. Bikers and scooty folks will merge suddenly from left.
2. On traffic signal, don't stop in middle of cars in a way that there is space on both side of your car. Bikers will try to squeeze and scratch your car both sides. Stop closing space left or right side.
3. Get a dashcam.
4. Assume there is always someone in blind curve. Sometimes its driving in wrong direction.
5. Get polaroid with minimal shade. They handle beams of others car very well.
6. Let rash drivers go if they are trying to overtake you. Blocking them increases their insanity at the moment and they drive dangerously.
7. Drive safely even if someone is blowing horn behind you to push you. There was a similar question asked twelve days ago. You might find some useful tips there: [https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a0kmka/learning\_driving\_from\_tomorrow\_what\_are\_some/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a0kmka/learning_driving_from_tomorrow_what_are_some/) Slow down but do not go off the road if an oncoming vehicle is approaching in front of you (driving on its wrong side).

Assume that everyone on the road is an idiot except for you. Anticipate them to make the worst possible moves and drive accordingly. * Practice parking at home a lot, become a pro at parking, so that when you find spaces in the real life, you can do it in a matter of seconds. I've seen so many people owning cars for years who can't park properly and will keep struggling for 15 minutes. Practice all common scenarios, especially parallel parking, and also perpendicular parking. Always park in reverse. Look at some youtube tutorials.

* Learn about the blind spots of your car right now. You should know the limitations of your view. The most important one is the blind spot on right ORVM, and then left ORVM.  Don't use your hand as indicators.  Here is an actual tip to help you learn better. While you're learning to control your car engine / clutch and breaks. Start by using them without shoes / sandles on. Driving barefoot or with socks on will help you understand the vibrations and feel of the clutch, accelerator and breaks way better. Whatever car you use. This also helps you adjust to new cars faster  . Please learn to use the upper/dipper lights properly. 


. I have the same car, it can squeeze through traffic easily. Don't do that. It just worsens the situation for everyone. 


. Respect zebra crossing and avoid lane changing without indicators. 





About accessories, I had changed my horn as nobody moved to the stock horn. 


How much did it cost second hand?  When my parents taught me to drive, they'd always say - any idiot can drive fast, it's being able to drive at slow speeds, up hills and in stop and go traffic that takes skill. 

Like many have said, learn to use the handbrake+accelerator to climb up a hill. Given our traffic, that will come in very handy. 

 One simple advice which has stuck in my head: ""while driving, don't be nice. Be predictable""  There are a lot of legally correct dead people. Even if you're following all the rules, be aware of others on the road. Your respect for road rules aren't gonna ensure your safety when others are being reckless. Always wear seat belt. most of car damages while taking reverse, please take care of that (if you dont have rear camera) And all of the points are covered by previous users. Something my dad tells me: A good drivers uses his brakes. A bad driver uses his horn. This doesn't apply to blind curves though. :)

&#x200B;

Also, something I learnt on my own: Do NOT use your clutch so much. You'll wear it out soon. It's a bit expensive to replace. Team BHP has plenty of resources on this topic. Some I like -

Get a dash cam the good one Invest in a dash cam.  How much did it cost? Just want to know Overtake when you've clear vision. Use low beam in cities & high beam on highways. Switch between high & low when you do not have clear vision during nights. This will also helps the other rider to understand whether you're giving a way or overtaking.

Always use indicators while changing lanes during day & night (especially).

[AskIndia]What will you do if you are falsely accused for sexual misconduct/abuse ?,38,9x959z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9x959z/askindiawhat_will_you_do_if_you_are_falsely/,47,"Lets say one fine day you get called by your HR and they show you an anonymous mail to them accusing you of sexual misconduct describing an incident that happened a couple of years ago, which you are sure is not true.

",chaprasibabu," Relevant story. 

My bestfriend was working for a tech giant (hint :- Anti national online shopping) and he met this girl who seemed like any other random girl you come across at workplace. 

Anyways, they both started chatting casually over WhatsApp, and she was on a leave for a day or two, so my dude casually texted to check on her which went on deaf ears of her. She comes to the office next day and raises a complaint to the manager that he's harassing her for no reason, and upon checking her phone it sent shockwaves. She deleted all her chats (as in replies sent by her) to show that he was constantly texting her times and times. She even went as far as deleting her call logs which threw him in the bad light. Luckily, my dude had backup of all the texts/call logs so he stood his case and she was thrown out of the company. 

P. S. :- I forgot to mention that she urged him to delete all the chats/call logs the day she was on leave so that they can start afresh.  i faced this. had to resign since walmart is now a major stakeholder in my company If your company is willing to fire you on an anonymous complaint that too of something that supposedly happened years ago, you do not wanna work there. I would fire the whole HR department. My face is my defense. That should prove no females were involved with anything I did. I'm a nice guy. Sexual misconduct kelie bhi female contact prerequisite hota he. Mere paas toh vohi nahi he.ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ **I didn't do anything.**  


A newly hired female colleague reported me for a sexual assault to the company. Falsely. I, with explicit and multiple consents by the ways of asking her specifically , had went till 2nd base with her one day after getting a little drunk. She proposed me for a relationship. I refused. She got offended and decided she could just ruin my career for her ego. After all, she is permitted and now-a-days even cheered on, for doing it. Women are after all fragile, innocent and gullible creatures who are constantly assaulted by boys like me who are all, without any pre-judgement and as a matter of fact, savage monsters.

Company decides to terminate me within half an hour of when she approached them. No questions asked. No statements taken. Just informed of *the decision* 

Sitting at home and writing this while the parents believe I've taken work-from-home kind of arrangement for a month since I missed them so much that I travelled back 3000 kms to spend some time with them. And I wait for the end of this month when I'll receive a lousy severance-package kind of compensation thinking about what the actual fuck just happened to me, still in disbelief.

[AskIndia] How mutually intelligible are indian languages?,17,aokmd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aokmd8/askindia_how_mutually_intelligible_are_indian/,24,,torithonuc," It varies greatly. Hindi and Urdu are almost totally mutually intelligible. Also Hindi speakers can understand bits and pieces of Marathi and Gujarati. I believe it is the same other way round. Bhojpuri is also quite mutually intelligible with Hindi.

Bengali, Assamese and Oriya have a lot of lingo in common, but I wouldn't say they are mutually intelligible. I am a native Bengali speaker and fluent in Hindi. I can understand bits of Oriya and Assamese if spoken very clearly and slowly. My Assamese friends can understand Bengali if spoken slowly as well. This also depends on which part of Assam they are from. Goalparia dialect of Assamese is very close to Bengali. And most Assamese people from Silchar and Barak valley understand and can speak a bit of Bengali.

A quick story time: Few years ago, I was travelling on a train from Keonjhar, Orissa to Ranchi, Jharkhand. One of my co-passengers was an old Oriya guy, who used to be a school teacher in Orissa. He was telling us, his co-passengers of his experiences, but in Oriya. I realised after a while that I could understand everything he was saying! I guess due to his lifelong teaching practice, he had developed this habit of speaking clearly and slowly. That day was a revelation to me, because I didn't know I could understand any Oriya before that (and I had several Oriya friends in university)!   Varies from language to language.

Most people who know Malayalam can understand Tamil and vice versa. Hindi and Urdu are fairly inter-mixable. Those who know Sanskrit often have a key to many other Indian languages including South Indian ones like Telugu.

 If you're wondering if all Indians can understand each other in their local languages, the answer is no. For example, if you're from the north and visit Tamil Nadu, you won't understand a single word of Tamil. you'll literally be the same level of understanding as a foreign tourist who landed 5 minutes ago.",AskIndia,2019-02-09 04:19:17
[AskIndia] When was the last time you burst crackers and what made you stop from bursting them?,34,9uol5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9uol5w/askindia_when_was_the_last_time_you_burst/,75,"Happy Deepavali btw!
I hope you all enjoy this time with your family and close friends! :)

",RahulRB1997," Didn't buy crackers after 10th Standard (10 years back)  . It felt childish.     1989. 

that's when we got our first gaming console.

every childhood Diwali since then dad would tell my brother and me that we can either get a video game cartridge or crackers.

we always went for cartridges - we went through games for an Atari, an NES knock-off (""little master"" or something), a Sega, and a PS1 (CDs) over the next 10 years. and, during this period, we had pretty much outgrown crackers.

edit:formatting. Since childhood, I've hated the bigger ones like laxmi bomb and all that stuff. (This was in early 2000s in New Delhi). I simply hate the voice.

Plus I have this fear of repetitive sounds. I hate the repetitive ding dong in BRTS bus. I hate creaking fans and washing machine ghhooo ghoo. My last time bursting crackers was around 12 years ago in 5-6th standard. My friends, siblings and I used enjoy bursting crackers a lot.
Initially the reason for stopping was the complaints from the top floor residents (we used to burst on our terrace). We had to go far to a ground to burst them.

Later on it just got boring we all stopped somewhat together (plus the crackers started to get very expensive). Now I’ll never pick it up for any given reason because of pollution. 2010 was the last time when I enjoyed bursting crackers. 2011 came and I joined this shitty JEE coaching center where they sucked the living soul out of us with 5 hours, 4pm-9pm lectures on weekdays and 9-12 hours on weekends. Diwali came around and I decided to sleep and gorge on food the entire night instead of dicking around with crackers. 

Also, I have this weird habit of extending fuse timer on crackers by tearing off the paper. It can be tiring and boring af and combined with shitty coaching hours, I just gave up. Never looked back since 2011. 

More than the pollution, it was the safety risk associated with crackers that also made me quit. On two occasions,  the sutli bomb exploded the moment I lit the fuse with incense stick with less than 3 ft. distance between the bomb and my face. On another occasion, tomato ketchup bottle (used for rockets) exploded because some mischievous kid rigged it with sutli bomb. Fortunately, no one was hurt. 

And hey, I don't even wanna factor in the uncertainties with certain crackers. I have seen exploding fire pots, violent chakris, butterfly bombs going berserk, rockets going inside home etc. 

I think somewhere among all the fun and Diwali adventures I had as a kid, I grew up. Now I prefer silence and good food (maybe daaru too?). 3-4 years. The only reason I want to burst them is because of the nostalgic value, little bit because of the boom (not the loud ones tho, only those small ones that are called lavang or whatever) and because some of them look visually pleasing. But not worth the time, money, pollution and don't forget the injuries.  After I finished +2, missed Diwali for couple of years as I was abroad for undergrad. Then took a semester break, was in India for Diwali, tried to burst crackers, just couldn’t do it, felt so silly.  Used to be something I did with my friends. Friends are not around so it's not as fun as it used to be. I stopped after a pencil sparkler exploded in my cousin's hand. Many years ago.  5-6 years ago because I am mostly a pussy when it comes to lighting crackers because I am afraid I might get into an accident. Just after 8th grade.  I guess I grew up.   There are many other fun activities to do now than in the 90s Happy Diwali people! Love y'all!

It was after class 10th I gave up crackers due to pollution they caused. I grew up. Interest went away. And then I, experienced the noise pollution and air pollution myself. Meaning, I realized how much of it we have to deal with, and my hate for it.  I'd loved bursting crackers, everything from sparklers to laxmi bomb was fun. Stopped about 10+ years after seeing how much crackers scared the stray dogs and cats in my lane :(  8th standard it was.

**I lit a 1000 wala and then walked away from crackers forever.** A month ago, had to scare off some monkeys on my inlaws roof. They mess with wires and water tanks.  Today.

I don't drive a car, I walk to work and home. I try taking public transport to go places. I enjoy bursting crackers. I know I can't justify this vs that, but I am still being responsible in other ways and celebrate the festival in the true spirit I like. In highschool itself, since I found out bursting crackers to be a very tedious and tiresome job. I would cough very badly when outside and would spend rest of the days till Bhaidooj as a sick patient. Stopped since 12 or so. Though I must admit, Sparklers and Flower Pots are my favorite thing. When i was in village i used to enjoy bursting crackers but since we came to Mumbai, i started loosing interest and after 9th standard( after 2009) i never burst any crackers, now I don't even feel the difference between normal days and diwali (maybe because i don't have any friends) except good homemade food and lighting. I was inspired by Al Gore's documentary - An inconvenient truth, in 2006. I was in 6th grade. That was the last time I burst cracker. 

My parents still got me a box of firecrackers in case I changed my mind. I just lit a couple of flower pot and sparklers. Then just stashed it away. That was last of it. Stopped since 2008,pollution(air&noise), pets whimpering by them and fire hazards were the reason we stopped.  Generally fear bursting crackers .. make a lot of noise  and seem dangerous to me ,  may be because as a child burst a minor cracker in hand ...just bought anaar and chakri only  & perhaps i stopped buying them in 5th class ; may be even earlier ; dont remember much . This year in my cousin's barat . Will miss the diwali tommorow but another cousin's marriage is coming in January so looking forward to it .  2007, someone else's rocket found a way inside our friendly neighbours house and burst in the face of their pet dog (Read - my best friend), I absolutely hate fire crackers since then and often used to have heated arguments with people who burst them. 2003. Slipped fell and slipped a disc while running away after lighting a 1000 Wala. Never again... Today. I love crackers. So i still burst it.
[Unpopular opinion] there is no diwali without crackers for me. Yesterday. Stopped for today, will start again from tomorrow. 2014, when I was 17. I was bursting a lot of crackers and having fun until a strange feeling of uneasiness in breathing started. Apparently I had received my father's wheezing (he had asthma but I only experienced wheezing). Ever since then it's been really uncomfortable facing any kind of smoke, from incense sticks to cigarettes to crackers. We, building kids stopped around 7th-8th std. Maybe 18 years ago. Around mid-2000s, hardly anyone bursted any crackers. Now almost no one wants to create air and noise pollution. Good to see that. 
happy Diwali to you too  2015, when I was trying to fire a charki but it got exploded. I was not able to see for next 2-3 minutes. That was the last day when I burnt crackers. Secondly I am a chronic sinusitis patient so, my family also stopped.  Since I was 10 (2007), always hated all sorts of fireworks (even the ""only light"" ones. Had my family stop by 2012. I guess mostly because I hated being suffocated. Been six years. To be honest, once I started working and got to experience air pollution first hand in Bangalore, I've been out off by anything that burns. Almost 6-7 years ago. It just wasn't fun anymore . My versions of 'fun' have changed over the years. Also I am more sensitive with the loud sounds and smoke,  that I prefer not to have them in my life. 

And not to mention I am not religious to say the least. 2011 was my last, it felt boring and silly tbh Yesterday. Burst exactly one 100 wala cracker because my mom believes that tradition must always be followed. 

So for ceremonial reasons we buy like one 100 wala for offering to the gods and burst it.

Logically doesn’t make sense, but eh, Moms will be moms. Stopped bursting after my 10th standard, when I moved to a new city, no friends so no one to enjoy cracker bursting with :/ Today. 

And I stopped to comment here. 10 years since I burnt more than a single fire cracker. Allergies made me stop.  It has been 8 years now, if I remember correctly. I didn't want to contribute to pollution. Started in 6th class under the assumption of it being another weird act to prove my masculinity and bravery. Continued under peer pressure until maybe 1st year of college. Haven't used them ever since. Today.. will burst again tomorrow, day after and next year.. and the year after that and again after that as well",AskIndia,2018-11-06 22:07:26

I was planning an international trip to Australia for leisure starting 15th Feb. I got a package and a quote from the travel agent and submitted my documents on 16th Jan and paid the amount in full for them to pre book tickets also. They filed my visa application on the 26th Jan and till date my visa application is lying in pending status. I have abandoned all hope of my vacation now, but given that I had paid a substantial amount, I am very pissed about losing all that money in vain. The travel agent is now saying that the tickets they booked were non refundable also and so I should consider all my money lost - apart from the visa application fees, which will anyway be used up for the application.

Should I just consider my money lost or should I ask the agent to refund my travel tickets cost? What measures do I have in case they refuse to refund?

Any help and guidance in this regard will be very appreciated.
",ishmael99," Was the agent responsible for the tickets and visa or just the tickets?

If he promised to handle everything then you should most definitely be getting your money back. Someone screwed up by buying tickets before getting the visa approved.   Never been to australia , are Australian tourist visa this difficult to get? Go to southern  coastal Maharashtra instead, explore the turquoise blue waters and the virgin golden sand. Can be explored  for (5000 rupees /four days.) Post on this Facebook group - travel talk. They have frequent travelers, and they'll guide you better. Honestly, one month is cutting it too short for planning an international trip, especially if visa is required. We don't have such luxuries of last minute travel plans. We need to plan and book well in advance, and plan to get visas done atleast a couple of weeks before the trip.  

However, I'm surprised the tour operator didn't warn you about this. ",AskIndia,2019-02-13 21:41:56

[AskIndia] What exactly is a curry?,34,a4irq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a4irq3/askindia_what_exactly_is_a_curry/,27,"Online I get asked a lot because of being Indian, what curry do I like and shit like that. I mostly know only one dish which is phonetically similar to curry, and that is [Kadhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadhi). This has been annoying me a lot, but what exactly is a fucking curry?",XpRienzo," There's no singular dish called curry. Any gravy in any savoury dish with either meat or vegetables or both can be a curry. Westerners are used to calling anything we do that resembles a gravy, a curry. Pretty much.  The word curry doesn't originate in North India, which is why you probably haven't heard of it. It's a Tamil word, and is commonly used in Kerala and TN (and possibly in KA/AP/TG?) for gravy dishes. The liquid gravy like accompaniment (usually made from onion, tomato etc), with solid vegetable, non-vegetable or dairy (paneer) items soaked within in various combinations. The taste can be varied by usage of various herbs and spices.

Well that's my understanding of it atleast. a  leaf I thought it's related to ""koora"" in AP. Koora roughly is a method of preparation that is kind of remains constant across usage of different vegetables.  ""Curry"" as the west calls it is as popularized by Britain, though it's still Indian origin but nothing to do with authentic Indian food. Depending upon the type of curry, different things.
 there's a whole season on a youtube channel discussing curry. It is really fun and interesting to watch. Please watch. here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzrgbu8gEMKb-Qbm8XeqxaJTqikofFmU) Curry is any dish accompanying rice or the variety of breads that we have, that contains vegetables, meat or fish which annot otherwise be classified as pickle or dessert. In Kerala for a traditional 'sadhya', you sometimes have 8+ dishes along with the rice, pickles and payasam.  Curry = Gravy 

 Basically any saucy dish, most often heavily spiced.
So e.g. non-indian style beef/lamb stew is saucy dish but not ""curry"".

You see, Indians cannot eat/tolerate dishes that's ""dry"" - that is not smothered in good amount of sauce/gravy. 
  When boss is Chutia and didn’t know what to assign work to whom and remain involved in politics 24x7 it’s a curry

And stuck in that mess is just like Pakora.

[AskIndia] What 'Indian' habits do admire?,67,9hp9v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9hp9v0/askindia_what_indian_habits_do_admire/,129,lets compliment the other thread. ,happy_teachers_day," Washing our butts with water instead of using paper. 
Cleaning our feet before entering someone’s home.  uh, I dunno about the rest of the world but I'm kind of glad that we can wash instead of using tissues after we go looloo  Saving money for rainy days.  Chai Aversion to wastage. 

We buy reusable stuff, smaller portion sizes and upcycle everything we use. A lot can be told by comparing dustbin size of a household of 4 here vs. household of 4 in US :P

Some of it came due to socialist economy and general scarcity. But I know of quite a few wealthy people who live a luxurious life but still don't like wastage and are frugal in consumption. The fact that we are surviving as a nation (for now). Historically we were never a country. The Maratha's spoke a different language than the Tamilians, Kashmiri people looked different than the ones from Nagaland and Gujrati people ate different food than the Odia people.

We went through a tonne of tests by fire after our independence. There was the Babri demolition, Kargil war, Mumbai attacks and most recently the Kerala floods.

The fact that our nation can support a minority of free thinkers (Yes I'm aware of the recent arrests). I view these people as the parallel culture within the country.
Even after the Lankesh and Dabholkar murders I personally knew people who were outraged. No matter how handful the minority is.. it does exist.
It seems like a bullshit point to mention this parallel culture but this is what is keeping a little hope burning inside me.
The most recent example I came across was the Kerala relief thread on r/India. I honestly got emotional reading the thread.. Where a guy donated a significant amount to the floods..
I'm not saying we are better or worse than anyone for doing so. I'm just pointing out the fact that there is at least a handful of people who are enough to spark some hope.

sometimes I wonder about the decisions that were taken by those who built the nation.
When Sardar Patel and Nehru fought to include a lot of independent territories in India. Or when Bhagat Singh stood at the gallows,  Or what went on Pritilata Waddedar's mind when she attacked the cafe..
We could've ended up in dead end chaos,but I sense that we are not there yet.

We might fall out of line some day, we might disintegrate into really really small nations that will be at war for eternity.
But I trust the parallel culture to find a way through. Friends, Family and strangers all are intent to help you. Also, if you do good, people around you appreciate it. Gotta love that

Not once do I ever feel awkward asking anyone for his phone to call or for time. Never has asking someone directions made me uncomfortable. Also, they take a personal interest in giving you the right directions to any place. 

Old people rock if you talk with them carefully and give an interesting turn on things. 

Interest parents take in their kid's studies is also something I admire The way Indians drink water from a bottle. We dont touch our lips with the bottle so that anyone can drink it. Buy a bigger size cloths so that we can use for longer time and some time share same cloth with elder siblings I feel this thread is going to be more depressing than the other one Bum gun....  MEHMAN NAWAZI, atithi dev bhavo!!! I Love it a lot. Capability to sustain all the hardships and struggles & carrying on with their lives. sharing food with others! Attention to detail when creating Reddit threads.  Dental hygiene: rinsing mouth after eating food.  Taking care of family.  Eating with your hands, You have total control over the portions that you are putting into your mouth compared to having food with a fork/knife/spoon where the portions are too less or too much . Some of the negative traits outlined in the other thread have a positive flip-side.

E.g.: Lack of privacy = Always having somebody to talk to. 1. Eating with hand, everything.
2. Managing chaos of life.
3. Adjusting everywhere.
4. Generally helpful if asked nicely. Not that other don't but. I feel Indians are hungry to if someone treat treat nicely or ask.
5. Genuine smile, specially in rural areas.
6. The Great Engineer in every family who have Jugaad for everything. Sharing, and mehmaan-nawaazi. Leaving shoes outside the home The ability to go anywhere on the planet and adapt to the environment. Also the ability to take our castes, religious bigotry and hatred to foreign shores. I was raised to help someone no matter what condition you were in. 

Also, no foot ware inside home and using hand to eat food. 
Spoon is good and all, but eating with your hand makes you conscious of your hygiene.  Saving our money! India is a very savings oriented country compared to Western nations which are more consumption oriented. We can excel in chaos, because we live in chaos all our lives. We're so used to things being non systematic. 

1. when we're late, we can rush and not panic and do things quickly, because we're so used to that. we're in rush all the time. 

2. we can drive in Indian traffic. its not an easy thing to do to go through the traffic which doesn't follow any rules and is more like brownian motion. 

3. we study a day before exams throughout college life, we know how to deal with deadlines and know how to prioritise things. Real life is more like that, having to excel at some of those chaotic times, and less like the American or other education systems where you continously perform at a moderate level. 

4. Our relationships are also chaotic, you marry a family, not a person. There are responsibilities from all sides, managing them is not as simple as in other countries. 

I can't think of more points but I'm sure there are many, we live in perpetual chaos, and can excel in chaos better than others. 
 *complement  नज़रों की शर्म। We have developed the food culture properly.  We take serious efforts to make our food tasty with Masala etc. The western people just eat that in basic form(meat with basic spices) .  We are doing it better.  Forming genuine friendships and relationships with the people around you. 


I think we do it better than the other countries, most of us probably have friends as good as family.   Reverence to books. A sense of family that makes us happier than we have any right to be given our economic and social situation. Philanthropy.



But in a narrow way  The way we treat other people. (I know there are horrible incidents now and then). That sweetness will melt your heart. There are some absolutely super niceness with all Indians.  I really can’t think of any. I feel terrible!

[AskIndia]What's your Unethical LifeProTip?,154,8wc8lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8wc8lm/askindiawhats_your_unethical_lifeprotip/,199,"Let me share the one I know.
If you want to avail free delivery on FK for low priced items make sure to add an extra item to your cart so that it goes beyond ₹500. You can cancel the other item later to get only the desired item.",sagardrokr," Dunno if this is unethical, but if you're struggling with customer service for any company, ask to *escalate* it to their manager. It probably affects their valuation, but it gets the job done. The very word escalate sends chills into the process, and lets the shit roll uphill for a brief period.

Got my ISP to fix my damn internet issues after 3-4 rounds of pointless customer care haggling. They sent a truck and checked all the lines. The irony is I was going to shift to another ISP a couple of weeks after that :P I know only the most obvious tip that everyone knows: you can pay bribes to get out of almost any situation especially if it's govt related. My friend works in Bsnl. Goes to office at 2pm comes home at 5pm. Thug Life.
 If you are in a heated argument with someone or if someone is being rude/loud just say ""first brush your teeth, your breathe is stinking"". My credit card gives 1000 points for making at least 4 (or 6?) transactions of Rs 1000+ per month. Now in a month, I easily spend more than what's required, but sometimes I forget to use the card at all in a month, so they send a message on the last week saying I have to make 2 more transactions or whatever to get 1000 points. So I transfer the money to Paytm or any other wallet which can be used later. My friend used to order items online and then cancel before they were shipped. It'll be refunded in a week, but transaction is made. 

These days, I don't need to do it as generally I'm spending more organically. Also, you can transfer money from Paytm to bank directly and use the same money to pay the credit card bill.

Bonus: Every year, when my credit card fee needs to be paid, I call the customer center and complain that fee is too high and I want to cancel the card. They waive off the fee (although for people who don't use the card much, they do it on certain conditions, they have waived off the fee for me unconditionally, for 2 years straight). [removed] 1. Lurk on Reddit waiting for a good thread with a lot of masala. 
2. Sort by Top posts and extract them into bite-sized text
3. Post on your blog, newspaper etc. Gonna get a lot of hate from Guys but eh. 

If you’re a girl, making puppy face with lil bit of crying will get you out of most situations.

Been there, done that. (Tho crying was genuine most of the times) Always carry only a 100 rupee note in the wallet. If you get stopped by a cop for something then show your wallet to him and tell him you only have 100 bucks. He will take it and move on.  Our house is super convulated to locate. We can take advantage of dominos 30 minute guarantee almost 30% of the time. Another non-unethical and useful tip: when ordering drinks like iced tea/cola at outlets like McD and KFC, always order them without ice. They have a separate entry for it in their machines and they'll do it readily. The drink out of the vending machine is already ice cold. Filling half the glass with ice just means less drink for you. It may be another thing if you are planning to nurse your drink for an hour. If you doing that Flipkart will block your account. Don't use that too often. I don't know if this is unethical but Zomato gives 50% off for first 5 delivery orders on applying promo code.Been ordering from  different family member phones for about 2 months.

Works for pretty much every company offering discounts for first time buyers [deleted] TL;DR - Lie to your parents

More like r/im14andthisisunethical but when I was a wee lad, every time I needed my parent's permission for some outing I'd tell them that Amit's (not real name) parents allowed already and Amit would tell his parents that my parents allowed already. My parents knew Amit pretty well so if they knew he was going to be there they'd be like yeah sure. Same for Amit. 

In college, I'd seen so many people with helicopter parents lie constantly about everything. Even about small trips to the general store. ""Why is there so much noise beta"" ""Mumma because I'm in the mess, do you not trust me? Would I lie to you yada yada."" Eh I would lie about late nights out too. While my parents generally didn't have any problem, my mom would worry excessively and not sleep until I told her I got home.

So basically gaslight your parents to have fun.  Use a blocked card for a one month trial thing that companies offer. They can’t charge you if the card is not working. Works especially for things like Apple Music where they give you 3 months free and then start deducting money without asking for confirmation. I don't think it is unethical, but here goes - 

I don't take any work calls after work hours. I let them go to voicemail and then listen to the msg. 

If the msg sounds like they had called me for a really important thing that can't be done without my help - I will call back and try to help them, if it won't take too much of my time.

If the msg says ""hey call me back, asap"", I'm like fuck off. Call me again and leave another voicemail telling me the topic.

If they didn't leave a voicemail - it wasn't that important then. ITT a lot of “non-unethical” LPTs 

You’ve made me so PROD fellow mitron!! When someone says shit like ""main tujhe dekh loonga"", ""main sabko bula ke laaoonga"", best answer is ""jo karna hai kar lena"" or ""theek hai"". We Indians have a tendency of talking big even if we are penniless ( gaan$ mein dum nahin,hum kisi se kam nahin)

In India, the only rule is ""show me the man and then I'll quote you the law"". 

If you have political influence, everything is totally legal. 

If you don't have, then it's a matter of luck. No authority may notice, or they may notice but ignore. But if you are unlucky, they may have monthly bribe targets to meet, see a bunch of juicy youngsters ready for the picking, and intimidate you into paying up or spending a day in jail on the technicality of not taking permission. 

Sometimes other problems unique to India occur - your crew may attract a crowd of gawkers thinking it's a ""bollywood philm"" shoot, cause traffic jams, and attract the law man that way.

Safe answer: better take some kind of written permission if you are not influential. Yeah it's legal as long as it is in a public space. Iirc Anurag Kashyap shot some scenes in GOW like that.  Yes. ",AskIndia,2019-02-17 03:22:15

Yes, this has sadly become common as the customer base has expanded to be more representative of Indian consumers. [Remember the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/afdag4/nice_guy_startup_edition/) here a few days ago which talked about how a customer purposely gave a wrong address for delivery just to test the system and see if they confirmed by calling him before shipping the package? He then tried to tell the seller he was doing them a favour by teaching them the basics of Indian e-commerce. I think any new platform or service in India starts-off promisingly because the early adopters play by the rules but it's not long before India infiltrates the system and enforces its own rules on the process thereby destroying it. i am not sure if this is relevant to you. But once an amazon delivery guy delivered a parcel at my doorstep. My father took it thinking i would have ordered something but i hadn't. When i checked the address and name that is pasted on the box, it showed the flat number as exactly same as mine but the apartment was next to mine. So i went ahead, called the owner (since the number was printed on the label) and asked him to pick it up. If i hadn't called him and kept the product, the owner would be in the exact situation as you.

TL;DR look around your apartment, in case there is another apartment and has the same flat number, the delivery guy would have confused it and delivered at wrong place. **NOTE**: BlueDart and FedEx are worse courier companies in India. Slower that Indian Postal Service.


BlueDart lies and update as if I called them and asked for delayed shipment because I am out of town! 

FedEx removes the tracking Docket from their website! If a parcel is coming on a day, I think you receive a SMS telling the guys name and mobile number Few days ago, I bought a product from Amazon, and it was shipped through FedEx.


After 12 days of delay, Amazon stopped showing any update and FedEx totally deleted the Docket number, saying - ""no such/invalid number""! Was the item delivered through Amazon or through a 3rd party? If the item was delivered through Amazon you should have got an SMS in the morning saying that your product was out for delivery and giving you a phone no. to contact the delivery agent. 

My experiences: I've had a couple of orders marked as ""delivered"" even when they weren't. They showed up the next day. 

I also had an instance where the delivery guy just left my package down with the building watchman and never told me about it. I only found out when I called him. 





 In India, always order CoD - even if it costs more! That way, you aren't screwed out of hard-earned money! Which courier was it? 

I have seen some delivery boys marking shipment as delivered and doing the actual delivery few hours later or by next day if it's getting late at night. But they always contact me before doing that.

Did you receive a ""arriving today"" sms? Check your mail, they always include phone number. 

You can also tell Amazon to send a replacement instead of refund.",AskIndia,2019-01-22 19:40:01

Since before Modi's term Manmohan Singh was our prime minster, it's only fair that we compare the two. Please do express your opinions. It's not about party politics, it's about what India needs and who's the right person to lead our country.",bk215," > who do you guys think should lead our country next year.

No one. Why do you think that the future of the country rests on one single person or a leader? Us depending on someone else to show us the direction has led us to this gigantic mess.  You have to understand, MMS was a coalition PM whereas Modi is a majority PM. I feel with his style of working, Modi wouldn't stand a month in a coalition government. Too much ego, power hungry and superiority. 

For someone who made us go through demonetization, I would have at least expected an apology. But man the ego, he still claims it to be a success. He would fuck an entire nation to the ground but not accept the failure. For him, he comes before the country. Heck, I don't think country comes up in his top 5 list.

MMS on the other hand, even if he went ahead with DeMo, would've sincerely come in front of the country and explain what went wrong and ask for an apology. This is the difference. I would like to call this kind of a guy my leader. Of course my opinion doesn't matter. We need a coalition where all members don't feel powerful enough to subvert the rule of law. We have too long tried to rely on the goodness of people, time to rely on institutional designs.  Why isn't it about party politics? What makes you think that Modi disagrees with the BJP/RSS ideology? I would like to see what the Modi apologists have to say about Yogi Adityanath as well. How are they able to claim that the BJP is all about development? 

I'd also say the position of Hindus have greatly weakened in our country under Modi's watch. Hindus were not constantly ""under attack"" in the MMS era (outside of BJP's states perhaps). But in the last four years, Hindus are apparently under attack everywhere and the Modi govt is unable to do anything about it. I think the Hindus will automatically become less under attack once the BJP is removed.

I'm not even going into how they're subverting institutions, filling all sorts of posts with idiots and have messed up the economy. But then a lot of folks care more about Modi than they do about India. MMS's term was about real politics - Nuclear Deal, RTI, Narega


NaMo's term just seems to be soundbites and tughlaqian moves Vote the ones that respect our constitution, diversity, democratic institutions and an independent media, everything else will fall into place. Also, disagree with ""it's not about party politics"", it definitely is about the party not the candidate in India. >It's not about party politics, it's about what India needs and who's the right person to lead our country.

Explain. 
 I don't think I know enough to comment on which prime minister helped India develop economically or globally etc.  But I can see one stark difference. 
The unity is slowly deteriorating. 
India is a secular country, but Hinduism is being actively (or passively) promoted by the government. 
It is not even being promoted by suggesting(politely) the good values of Hinduism. It is promoted on the expense that all other religions (and their practices) are villainous. 

So many lynchings due to beef, murders in churches, burning of mosques and other incidents... 

I am not here to shout out and correct these wrongs. 
I am just a guy scared of a civil war. 
Scared of my friends and family's safety. 
You never know when your neighbours start breaking your friend's head in front of your eyes because he worships a different god. 

I want peace. 
I want a leader who wants a peaceful society. 
I want a leader who accepts India for what it is.

 Us , you and me of various religions and cultures.  MMS was governing. Modi is only trying to stay in power. IMHO If Modi steps down from his high horse, apologies for some of his fuck ups and moves a notch (talking even about an inch) to the centre - its more the movement in  the central direction than how much, he will definetly get the next term.
However I'm more concerned about shah. The guy just plain scares me 10 years of the unbridled neo-liberal push has filled me with so much hate for both these parties to a point that I won't mind if Stalin crawls out of his grave and Gulags them. Sab Jumla Hai ! >What does ~~R/India~~ i think about Prime Minister Modi's term vs former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's term.

Modi's term is good and India is developing under Modis term.

>It's not about party politics, it's about what India needs and who's the right person to lead our country.

If its not about party pilitics and if its about India and India's future. Modi is only strong leader who can lead the country in present political scenario. Modi should and must get second term. Ab hum kare toh kare kya, kahe to kahr kya? Modi government have taken decisions just for the sake of decision making. His government was like the Kardashians of India. Doing nothing of importance but gaining fame nonetheless. Consider any steps taken by him, demonitisation was deemed as a revolutionary step by everyone, it was also carried out  in a dramatic way. 
Argue about the disadvantages our country faced  because of it , and the bhakts go up in flames. I mean seriously, just because he took a daring step does not make it right it's not fucking roadies where just being outrageous will win you something. You are running a country. Every step taken by modi government were cosmetic in nature. No real quality behind them. 

What about the education, the scarcity of colleges, scarcity of job position.. A BJP majority government for the next 5 years at least, for doing the much needed but unpopular changes in system. I do not want a coalition Govt.I have no illusions that any of the political parties actually care about the common man.They just want the appearance of having done something for the common man,state, economy etc. They are all in it to make money and make no mistake being in politics is a costly business.So all of them are equally corrupt and all of them have nepotistic incestuous dealings with business who donate in black to them.

Coalitions Govt are basically useless place holders where nothing gets done because of ego placating and firefighting the power battles that rage on daily and the smaller regional parties will demand their pound of flesh and whatever Govt ministry the get will be next to useless for the time they are in power.While the larger parties have a bigger talent pool and you may occasional find someone competent to either do the job or let the smart babus under him actually do the job an regional party will usually put a useless guy as a Minister

a. Some of the courses exist clearly for the money and mainly rely upon the overall brand to get applications. 

b. The campus is scattered! While the main campus in Lavale is beautiful, the undergraduate colleges are mainly based across two campuses in Pune. Not a big factor, but there is tradeoff accessibility to the city life with the campus ""feel"".

The first incident, I was walking along with my friends returning from a restaurant in Koramangala. It was almost midnight. We were split up into a group of two. Two policemen on a bike stopped right in front of the first group asked my friend a few questions like: 

* Where are you coming from?
* Where do you stay?
* Which city are you from?
* Where do you work? 

After inquiring about this he was still not satisfied and asked him to come closer. He then went on to search his pockets, thinking he might find some drugs or something. He then told us that to go straight to your home and walking like that in a middle of the night is not allowed here. 

I was furious at the whole situation. I knew that they don't have the rights to do such a thing but at the same time I didn't want to make a scene. So I let that go. 

On the second incident, the same thing happened, this time in HSR. We were waiting for an Uber at midnight. And here they came again and asked: ""What are we doing here?"". Luckily, we had a white guy with us (an employee from the US) so they were hesitant to ask any further question and told us to leave the area and hurried away. 

I don't know man how to feel about this.  Not a lawyer but of course no. [removed] If you get stopped by police at night or in middle of somewhere, first ask for IDs. They can be impersonators too. Secondly being polite in conversations is the best way to not hurt their small dick egos and wade your way out through it. 

And constables do have the smallest dicks..sorry egos. I had two constables in plain clothes knocking my door at 6 in morning. They started inquiring about my bike, asking for RC card. I asked them for their IDs. They told they are night time patrol party. I still insisted on IDs. They took the photo of my bike and went away. After few mins they bought a patrolling van with two dressed policemen. The point of contention was my bike not have number plates. Then they started telling me we will impound the bike and after showing all the relevant documents like RC card, insurance, driving license etc they went. All the this time the two constables where behaving as they are the SP of the district. They can ask, but you don't have to comply. They can seize the items on your person if they're arresting you, but they need cause or a warrant to actually arrest you. Once arrested, you can't be held more than 24 hours without being taken to a magistrate. 
In my view, if you haven't done anything wrong, you should never turn over your phone to police just because they ask.

You can learn more about your basic rights at nyaaya.in I was once asked to step out of a cab and was frisked and question. Have always wondered if they were legally allowed to do it. And if no, what's the best thing to do other than being politely adamant about a fuck no. Even tried asking a lawyer once, still got no answer to this.  Yes they can search a person without warrant.(does no one here use google :p)

They can also make you handover your phone.
But if it’s locked, you can say you forgot your PIN and deny them access to it. (at least in US, this is perfectly legal)
Although, Indian police being indian police, may give you a slap. किस्मत हो गांडू तो क्या करेगा पाण्डू ! माँ चुदी और क्या, दे दे फ़ोन. It's kinda off topic but relevant. 

I was sitting outside of our apartment along with a friend around 1-2am in the morning. We were just cracking jokes and taking jabs at each other, and mind you we were not disturbing anybody. So, a few minutes later, two cops pull up and start asking questions such as 

Where do I live? 

Who do you live with?

Which flat? 

Owner or tenant? 

After answering all their queries, they asked me to leave just turn around and go home, but they followed my friend till home.  You are not obligated to hand over anything to a police officer, there are even laws on how much each police rank can fine a person for.

However, India doesn't operate under laws. If a policeman wants to hurt you he probably can and also get away with it. The justice system is slow, often corrupt and expensive.  Look. Officers of the Peace are your friends.

In my city its said to do BCA in a college and just give exams their while taking certifications of programming languages , learning it from classes run by private institutions.

I Have heard that MCA degrees matters most and doing only BCA is worthless but also have heard that MCA teaches you what you learnt it BCA again.

SO basically I dont know what to do.Should I do BCA and those certifications . Should I do that and also do MCA. Should I do some other degree ? What should I learn for ensuring a good future.

I am very confused and dont know anything about the industry really so I ask for your help guys ",TrueSaiyanGod," First of all, don't do/follow things just because 99% of the people do it.  
Ask yourself whether you really want it.   
Don't mean to discourage you, but I have met a lot of people who have studied fields they have no interest in and have regretted it.  
  
If you really wanna pursue BCA/MCA , one more advice I would give is that in today's world you don't need a degree to prove yourself. Udemy is a great place to learn a lot of SD.

For example, one of my friends, 20, who goes to college full time, makes serious bank by being a club promoter. Another one, 19, makes around 15k a month by flipping the stuff he bought in airport customs auctions. 

Evidently, there's plenty of money to go around if you know where to look for it. What are some of such untapped opportunities you might know of? ",killallnormies69," [deleted] Tuition teacher.

Before that, he was generally training people for around 5-6k per month.  Commenting for visibility Many good phones (and even TVs now) these days are being sold in 'flash sales'. Of course not all people can manage to click the button on time. Few people have taken advantage of this and if they manage to get the phone in their cart or maybe order the phone (through genuine means or not) via cash on delivery, the next moment they put up ads on sites like Olx selling the undelivered phone for a thousand or more rupees, then they change the delivery address to yours or call you at the time of delivery to give them the cash and take the product yourself. Not very lucrative but a good way to make a few thousand bucks with just a few clicks. I know this as I myself bought a phone this way after having failed multiple times to get in on the flash sale.

Share your startup/business story and motivate us peasants to dream bigger and work hard towards achieving one's passion. People who are planning to work on something of their own anytime soon can participate as well. ,not_the_coolest_guy," Gimme 30 mins.  Me and my best friend have been planning to start a business on our own. We've been bouncing ideas off each other, and luckily a few ideas did strike a thought that it can solve a problem. 

I came up with an idea of making an IOT device which is beneficial for Brick & Mortar stores. Then i put more thoughts into and it can be used at many places which is solving a whole different issue on its own. Thought it may seem complicated to explain, it is a game changer. We are a team of 3, and we're going to start working on the prototype from next month possibly. 

My best friend came up with an idea for displaying ads in a whole different way. Instead of spending money on the hoardings (which i'm hoping nobody even cares to look at), he came up with a brilliant idea which may seem ridiculous, but hey there are several people out there who made all sorts of ridiculous products. 

I have yet another idea for a mobile game which rewards the players depending on how the game is played. It is similar to Subway Surfers, but with a completely different approach. This is doable, but the main problem is licensing (Yeah, we want to work with fast food brands, this way everybody makes money). It's expensive in the beginning itself. The whole concept lies runs around brands. This game has a great potential and I've already ran this idea through a couple of friends and everybody was interested because of the rewards. It has a potential, it's just a matter of money and licensing which is stopping us. 

I have yet another idea for a smart CCTV camera. There are a few companies which are already doing this (not in India obviously) and they are already popular because this is really helpful in a sorta way which i can explain but that would giveaway the recipe to success haha. 

Another idea runs around helping startups. Think of it like a startup for startup. Startups usually run into a lot of problems hence don't concentrate well enough on the product. So, we take care of everything else (automated web-app) so that they can freely work on the product. 

Best friend had an idea for a app (Dunzo) but i thought that was ridiculous. I mean c'mon, people are lazy af so i brushed it off. Bad luck i guess. 

I have many more ideas ratting around in my mind. I could've sold ideas for money :p May be everyone's busy working hard on their business, they have no time to comment. Fair enough.",AskIndia,2019-01-18 19:01:12

I'm not married but I've never had issues getting rooms with partners. Well almost never.

What is it like for married folk that didnt change their last names? I know some of my friends have last names so common that they found partners with the same last name, but I'm talking about people that dont have the same last name.



I also wonder what it would be like for inter faith/caste couples.",CaptainPoverty," My wife did not change her last name. No problem so far. It's ok as long as you go to a reputed hotel, and have booked for two. 
Was once asked for proof of marriage in Thrissur. Showed a wedding photo in the phone. My wife didn't change her name. But in her aadhar my name is mentioned in the w/o section. So it isn't very difficult to prove our marriage. So far wherever we have booked in India we have not faced any problem whatsoever.  Wife and I have different surnames. Never ever had any issues either in Tamil Nadu, kerala, bangalore, Mumbai, pune or Chennai. Since the early 2000s.

 Interfaith couple here, wife didn't change name after marriage. Never had any issue, even when we were dating before marriage. To be honest, I probably haven't stayed in too many hotels, as we didn't travel a lot within India, and that too we were travelling with family half of the times.   

Maybe we never had issues because we only really booked hotels when we were travelling with bags, didn't need a hotel room for a random hookup night or anything, which is what some young couples try to book for. 

It's getting increasingly common for wives not to change their last names, by the way. Most people I know who got married in last few years didn't change their names.  My friend and his wife have different surname. And my friend travels to Delhi for official purposes. They dont get problem in Delhi. But they went to a city(which i dont want to name for obvious reasons) hotel manager denied. Then they booked hotel on oyo and they got it even though it was not couple friendly. Is this a thing in India? Is that a thing? Wouldn't things be ***more*** inconvenient if you change your official surname?

Not only would this necessitate getting a replacement for your passport (if you have one) or ID card, but you would need to change the details of all of your:

* utility bills (gas, electricity, water, internet)
* mobile phone contract
* bank accounts
* investment accounts

….and presumably submit proof that you weren't committing fraud in the process? Inter-community marriage here. Once was asked at a small hotel (~1000 rs per night) at Aurangabad. Showed our wedding pics on FB and it was fine. Never had a problem anywhere else.  Double surname is most flexible. Use as per convenience.

Please note: neither me nor my partner or original owner collected any rent. Nor was this property ever given on rent.

Now, as per one of solution suggested, it has been advised to pledge this property for a loan and thereafter default and push this property to auction where we(another member of extended family) will purchase this property and subsequently keep.

The Prestige (favourite movie of all time)

Lucky Number Slevin

Seven

Memento

Gone Girl

The green mile

Interstellar [removed] Movies  I prefer
In hindi- kahani, drishyam, A wednesday, 20 saal baad(if you like to watch old movies)
In english- flight club, shutter island, prestige, machinist, sixth sense

Q.How much euro should I take with me as food & hotel are taken care by the tour operator. 

Q.What are some possible scams I must avoid in these places ?

Q.What are some good mementos I must buy ?

Thanks for your suggestions .",super_banker," I think 10 places in 14 days is too much in too little time, this will exhaust you. If you can, remove a few places and make it easier.

You can skip Brussels, it's has little to offer. Bruges or Ghent are better. 

When you are coming to cologne, ping me. If possible I will give you a tour.


For Paris and Rome, make a shortlist of a few places to visit and stick to it. Not everything is possible to cover. Also, you MUST do Seine river cruise at night, it is worth in gold.

 I was in Europe in June2018 for a similar trip but not in belgium and amsterdam.  
   
Your itinerary will cover most of the places if not dm me the itinerary and I could tell where all more to go. Find location of your hotel and see nearby places on tripadvisor.
Carry around 250Euro and 150-200Fr for your trip. Euro also works in Switzerladnd with conversion rate around 1.11/1.12. Still try to eat local food, it's delicious specially in Italy and Switzerland.   
  
Paris has many scams going around every street like asking for pen and then taking away bags, 3 cup guess the ball game. Avoid them, don't even interact with anyone near these scams going on. Rest of europe is pretty safe but please be careful about everything(valuables/visa) in paris. I know someone whose passport was stolen on Day 1 of his trip in Paris from their hotel and then it was a nightmare for them.  
  
Buy Swarovski crystals they are beautiful, Wine from paris, chocolates and wrist watch from switzerland, cuckoo clock(they are fragile so we didn't buy) from Heidelberg.   
  
This will be an awesome trip for you. You will enjoy a lot. Trust me every moment you will just stare there in awe and find that the whole place is really really beautiful. There's nothing like Switzerland  from Rhine Falls to Mt. Jungfrau to Zurich Lake to Mt. Titlis to Lucerne and many more things.  Please go to 3 places at the most. You will not get time to do anything and will be super tired by the end of the vacation. Also if you are vegetarian, you might have hard time trying to find food.

Note: Please be prepared to shell out money for water.  Package tours are such a rip-off. Do you seriously consider this a holiday? So many cities in so few days - what will you even pick up, experience-wise, from any of these places? Just pictures, staying in hotels, riding in a van with twenty strangers to regular tourist haunts? Gosh 1) Leave your mom in hotel & visit an adult show in Amsterdam with your wife. Worth it.  
2) Paris : Take a day off from tour operator & visit Bruges in Belgium by Train (TGV). DO NOT go to Versailles Palace. Extremely overrated.

3) Interlaken : Visit Spiez near Interlaken. Beautiful vie of the lake.  
4) In Innsbruck my wife & I took the local Monorail/Tram to the outskirts of Innsbruck to a village. It is still my favorite place in Europe. Small quaint beautiful Alpine village.

5) Rome : If you've a day off take the train & boat day trip to Capri. [deleted] sotc ? Most probably, there would be Disneyland in your itinerary. You can skip that is you are not a fan of amusement parks. You can explore the city on that day",AskIndia,2018-11-27 22:23:05

About 10-15 years ago there used to be just a few swamis on TV once in a while, Now we have them 24 hours a day. 

Also looking at pop culture, I feel like movies from before 20-25 years ago didn't go crazy about God. The issue was there but these days the reverence, blind acceptance, following seems to be pervasive. True, there are movies like Piku and others but majority of them just don't want to offend religion. It's because everyone walks on eggshells when talking about religion these days, who knows who gets offended and kills/shames you. 

Do we have one popular figure in the country that claims he is an athiest? Hinduism actually accepts atheism to be a valid way but I strongly feel an ahtiest will not be tolerated today. 

Demography wise, from observation, people born in the 70s, 80s, 90s feel like don't question religion at all and do a lot more puja and vrath. They are more afraid of God and consequences, as all these hundreds of puja varieties sprouted up just to meet the needs of that people.

I don't think it's that. I think the secular elite has lost its monopoly over certain forms of mass media which has made it easier for ""India"" to assert itself through these forms. Take television for example, it was much easier to control when you just had *Doordarshan* though it had its share of mythological entertainment. As this along with other sectors opened up, there was increased brashness and crudity in the race to attract the greatest number of viewers. 

I also feel we must stop blaming TV and films for faults that are our own. I mean, people want to see, hear and consume these things. If they didn't, these things wouldn't be popular. You can't force something alien down peoples' throats. At the end of the day, they want to digest their home-cooked food with a little Western pizzaz which is what popular entertainment is in India nowadays. So, in summary, I don't think India has become more religious, it's just that popular entertainment has become more Indian. I think it's because more and more common folks are getting access to technology now a days especially due to Jio. What is visible nowadays is what India was always been before. 

During earlier times the kind of people who gets offended easily were not having any sort of access to a platform like what we have today and it is very easy to comment/criticize on each and everything now.

 1. People today are more Informed and Vocalization/propagation of thought is easier than past.

2. People have more free time than past. 

 As someone has already said, India has become less religious but more communal and coverage it receives now a days is also much more than the olden TV days with a single TV channel. 

People are not as rigid as they used to be. At least in this part of north India. I have heard that south Indians are much more rigid in their religious and societal belief but nevertheless, more and more people are having inter caste marriages and society has finally let go at least some part of their orthodoxiness. But community wise, we have very well degraded. Reason mostly being the media perception of the islamic population and also the belief that Hindus are losing their demographic advantage. From Livemint:

[Why India’s growing religiosity is an economic challenge](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/OLVG9AuN5b2DWoN0127RCL/Why-Indias-growing-religiosity-is-an-economic-challenge.html)

>apart from Kyrgyzstan, India is the only country where the proportion of people who considered religion to be an important part of their lives grew by more than 10 percentage points over the past decade.

Religion is much more visible, and I think communities want to assert pride in their identity more.

[India's youth is also very conservative](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/youth-modern-in-look-conservative-in-outlook-survey/article17819664.ece)

As people from poorer and more rural backgrounds gradually get richer it's natural for them to bring their religiosity with them. That's probably why religion is more visible. That, and there's just more people now. Religion has actually become unpopular among urban youth compared to 20-30 year ago, most youths look at religion as an act of rebellion. Also religious reforms which have always been a part of Hinduism is completely extinct since we got freedom from Britishers.
Certain obsolete religious practices like women not allowed in funeral pyre needs to be completely dis banded but wonder why in today's age we don't have social reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Jyotiba Phule etc . more like pseudo religious. most people have no spiritual bearings, but they like the dogmas and dikhawas Not at all.

I know atleast 200 people in my social circle, less than 30.years of age, and less than 100 are even theists and less than 20 worship regularly. Hinduism having atheism as sect doesn't mean that all the Hindus wouldn't be argumentative against atheism. It all boils down to ones biases, opinion, and belief.

A few centuries ago, there used to be a rift between Shaivas and Vaishnavas.

What you call Hinduism is just an umberella name for all the Indian traditions given by outsiders. So, all these sects are just different Indian sects/opinions now tagged under a single religion.

The average Hindu(or Indian) perhaps doesn't know the facts that you know, the very facts which are part of their religion. The average Indian just prays God for their own good(just like anywhere else in the world), chants mantras without knowing their meaning, keeps Bhagavadgita in their pooja room but never reads it.

Honestly, the people who bite to the propaganda shit are the educated/semi-educated people(who get their half knowledge from social media rants) more than the non-millennial people.

Most of our extended family members are not hostile towards other religions. But the people who read propaganda in the social media may subscribe to it in their teens. Also, it goes both ways.

This will only get worse, as the more and more people started using Whatsapp/Facebook etc. Most of the things that people do on social media are only based on ""the trend"", not really based on their original opinions/ideas. It takes some more time to propagate another trend to say that this is ""uncool"". It hasn't gotten more religious, it has gotten more polarised with the rise of the BJP and their ideology. What is religion ? Rise of a new middle class could be the reason. The booming Indian economy has made a lot of poor people rich. However, they are yet to come out of their old habits and customs.",AskIndia,2018-12-16 05:15:28
"[serious] [reddiquette] [askindia] March End woes, questions regarding rent receipt submission and taxation and legalities.",7,b6uzbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b6uzbt/serious_reddiquette_askindia_march_end_woes/,0,"Hello r/india! I have been living in a non-metro city for past few years and recently shifted jobs (Company A and B) and houses (House H1 and H2) both.

**Backstory:**

Concerned apartment (and other unknown businesses) is/are owned by a lady ""F"", whose husband ""M"" holds an ""Irrevocable Power of Attorney"" for all things owned/operated/etc by F. Account provided to me to transfer rent every month belongs to daughter ""D"" (no idea if it is joint account). M had sent me his HUF PAN card photo before the agreement was done.

Due to some issues, broker who showed the flat was out of picture during actual registration of agreement - which happened at sub-registrar's office and not online. M was never asked to submit his individual PAN or even present F's PAN.

All rent transfers were always online (IMPS or NEFT) from the my same account to the provided D's account.

**Actual Issue:**

From April 2017 to March 2019, I have been staying at the H1. The rent was initially little less than 14k and then after 11 months, me and my owner mutually agreed to extend the agreement (over a phone call), in which he also proposed an increase in rent of rupees 1000/-. Later, in a next call few days later, he asked me to 'pay rounded amount' as the rent which was exact 15k. I obliged to his terms all the times.

Now, when in January 2018, I had asked him for PAN, he said he'll talk to his lawyer and decide. Later, he declined giving it to me. Because I was not in any taxable slab, CA at company A only showed <1 lacs as rent paid and it was fine. This CA was not fine with M's HUF PAN as owner's PAN.

Coming to January 2019, I was confident owner would not provide PAN but still gave a call and to my surprise he said yes. He kept on prolonging actually giving it to me citing ""TDS would be cut"". I told him he's a Self Employed person, so no one is going to cut TDS from him. He still never gave it. LOL. So even for FY18-19, CA at company A used 8000/- as rent paid every month as I was still out of tax slabs (submitted original agreement copy and bank statement - was never asked to submit rent receipts, and no PAN was submitted here).

End on Jan, I switched jobs. Company B CA did not have a problem with HUF PAN and asked me to submit rent receipts with HUF PAN mentioned. Also, when I explained him the scenario, he asked me to address rent receipts to ""M"" instead of ""F"" as I had previously done.

Rent for H1 has been paid until March 2019, but I shifted to H2 (rent 22k) around mid March and paid equivalent rent there too. H2 has a registered agreement from March 2019 which allowed me to shift mid month because of an emergency.

**Important Note:**

I don't care how M or F move their money around (may be in millions, has political family and is from rural west MH).
All I care is saving my money and not paying his taxes - now that I am taxable. And not legally implicated.

**Questions:**

1. Whose PAN should actually have been provided/asked by me during registration of agreement?
2. Submitting rent receipts for first time: Legal issues for forging M's signature (for actual rent paid as he would never give signature voluntarily)?
3. Given that actual registered agreement period was over after 11 months but I was actually staying there for 13 months more and paying electricity bills and rents (all online) prove I was still a resident at the flat?

Question 3 assumes that I get IT query after owner declares signatures forged, declines I was resident or paid rent for period after agreement.

Thanks to all for your time and help.

TLDR: Verbally extended rental agreement has no PAN as owner/attorney does not wish to provide it. Forging signature on receipts for actual rent paid online every time. Implications?",rakhsup92,,AskIndia,2019-03-29 17:11:37
[AskIndia] Alternatives to the MBA?,16,abim7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/abim7d/askindia_alternatives_to_the_mba/,10,"Hi reddit. Thanks for trying to help.

I'm 24 and currently in a job at an MNC. Its one of those BS entry level jobs people take at a brand-name company before they fuck off to get their MBAs or do other things. I've been here about 20 months now and need to make a committed decision about my future so that I can eventually make 1.6 LPM. (half-joking)

Don't want to do CA / CFA / accounting courses / Govt jobs /Civil Services. Gave law considerable thought, but starting over UG for a less than a certain future is daunting. I would like to relieve my parents ASAP. In hindsight, my BBA degree wasn't the smartest of choices. I'm not creative / talented at anything, per se and not into finding my passion. My vague guess is that a sales / BD role would be best for me and believe that the MBA ( from a good college, ofc ) may be a good ( not the best ) route for a better ""career.""
But every part of me just screams against the thought of having to go through CAT and the will-I-won't-I dance. 

So before I resign myself to it, anybody come out of similar life circumstances? What else can do you in India today apart from the MBA? Any ideas on how to break into a lucrative career considering I have no skills of value, at the moment?",JadedAssociate," Look at some industry relevant new courses like PGDBA from IIM-C or one in Data Science from IIIT-B etc. I think they may be better for you than the generalist MBA which is losing relevance in digital economy. They were good in past when FMCG, traditional marketing etc were lucrative, but this is the world of IT, Big Data, Analytics etc. Be future ready. If you actually want to make close to 2 LPM (inflation and growth adjusted 1.6 LPM), you need to be really good at what you do. It doesn't really matter(that much) what you do though. If you are the top 1-5% of that field, you will make that amount rather easily. Let's talk about engineering for example. Top 1-5% web developers make that amount, so do back-end engineers, so do data scientists. This also applies to fields other than engineering.

People often ask me what field to go, to make x amount of money. What they don't understand is while your field does impact your pay, it doesn't to as big of an extent as your skill in that field. Talented guys are ALWAYS very high in demand and command a very high leverage, since they are hard to replace.

Continue what you are doing, just become a lot better at it. You'll make that amount. Big chunk of 1.6 LPM jobs are in emerging fields like analytics, big data, AI, ML, econometrics and blockchain. There are niche degrees that can help you break in them.

One word of advice for CAT. If you get IIM A,B,C - you will do very well. The new IIMs are  just namesakes - you will passout with a very low salary. Please dont get scammed by new IIMs. Are there people at work 5-10-15 years older whose job/career trajectory you would like to follow? 

In MNC's moving up the ladder has nothing to do with your degree, but knowing the right movers and shakers and being useful to them. In that process of being useful, you learn tons of thing no MBA program will teach you. And if you are useful they will automatically pull you up the food chain and advice you on what you need to do. 

All it takes is meeting different characters and saying you have been observing them and respect what they have achieved and would like to work with them or learn from them as much as possible. Sooner or later one guy will say I have this project I don't have anyone to assign too, are you interested? And thats how you make things happen without blindly doing what the rest of the herd is doing. Good luck!   Thought about Civil Services? As someone has mentioned, breaking into analytics and data science is an option, but it will require a lot of studies. Another option (and the fastest way to reach 1.6 lpa) is to get into sales, and get good at it.

The culture is the worst though in initial few months, but if you're good at it, you'll be like a king. But you'll really have to get into it to find out if you're made for it and it's difficult to get out of sales. Join a lala company and work your ass off for one year. While you are there, learn how much ever you can about running a business. After that start your own.",AskIndia,2019-01-01 22:38:52

I will be travelling to India next week, for the first time.


I had planned to initially stay in Delhi for a few days as that is where I will be flying into. However, the air pollution is making me reconsider. The air seems to have stayed at extremely hazardous levels for the past couple months.


I am now seriously wondering if I should immediately hop on another plane to Jaipur to avoid staying in that air for even a day. I am also carrying respirator masks.


I'm thinking that the more chill, cleaner Jaipur and state of Rajasthan would be a better introduction to India and to the travel lifestyle than having to worry about my health in Delhi.


However, there is so much to see in Delhi and I have one friend there who had planned to show me around a bit.


What would you do in this situation?",owrecruit," Even a Delhite wants to skip Delhi these days. Good luck with your travel plans. Absolutely the best decision my man!

SKIP entirety of North, but don't skip the mountains. i'd avoid entire north central india at this time, the pollution is at peak levels here right now..you could fly to mumbai then jaipur then onto goa etc.. you didn't mention how many days you're staying If you have never been to India then you should visit Delhi. It's unique and yes the pollution is shit here but I would still recommend you visit for a day or two. 

Otherwise Jaipur is not a bad option. The air is much cleaner, less crowded and plenty to see as well I'm not right guy to answer this but I think you can stay for few days. Without any backing from medical data, there should be no long term effect of you are healthy and without respiratory problem. I would skip Delhi too, especially because it’s winters and AQI is especially bad in winters due to stagnant air. PM2.5 is 300+ pretty much throughout the day going above 500 at times.
 Don't skip delhi.
Travel to the worst affected areas.
*Go to the wazirabad barragae and see how delhi rapes the very river it gets it's drinking water from.
*Go to the slums near pragati maidan, okhla, seemapuri and see what a third world shit hole really looks like.

I don't know where you were where there were no issues with the change. Hell, even a 20 Euro note at a small grocery store will get you a grimace if you buy something that's worth a few Euros. 

> Checkout people even at name brand supermarkets cringe when they see you bust out a Rs 2000 note.

Maybe this is the best time to start using UPI? ;)  This is not entirely true. Give a 100 dollar note to a cashier in US and they will decline to take it for a small transaction. 

Shops have limited change that they hold for the day and cant give it all away at the start of the day. Also banks charges them for giving small change. A family member of mine had a small shop in Delhi and had asked me to give her all the change as banks also gave them limited amount of it. Obviously if you are buying something for Rs 50 and give a Rs 2000 or even Rs 500 note, you cant expect the shop keeper to hand over to you all of their change for the day.  *Hota sabke paas hai, deta koi nahi.* Yaha par bhi hamare country ko pale thae. Why don't you manage your change? Be the change you want to see


- The guy whose picture is on yo money The problem is nobody (aam aadmi) wants change - people will come to my store looking to change their 2000 rupee notes and I drop 2 bundle of 10 rupee notes. They just don't want it. It's too much to carry. So people prefer bigger denominations.
Even my bank teller makes a face when I go in with my bundles of 10 rupee notes. (SBI hain, toh I won't pass my opportunity to give it back)

So it's only business in the retail space that need change and that is easily available with my banker but for a defined limit. Or you pay via card  (jisme bank takes their 2% odd commission and other stuff - story for another day)

Coming to chillar. People trade in it for a commission so most of the people hoard it and then sell it at a commission to a broker who sells it to someone else for a commission. 

To sum it up - small denominations, people don't want but expect to be changed when they give a big note, so imagine it as a retailer I keep getting only bigger notes, how am I to give you back your change if you are not providing me with any.

I hope I answered the question but it's kind of a vague theory of mine.

What I agree to is, ATMs need to dispense more of 100 and 200 rupee notes but isn't it easier to load up with 2000s and 500s, makes the logistics a lot easier, na?

 Idk about that. But after traveling in bus for a month I collect half a kilo worth of spare change. blame it on the media. neither had they propagated the punchline *chhutta nahi hai, agae badho*, nor would have our people adopted this literally into our lives.
