I can't get over Shaktikanta Das being appointed as RBI Governor,344,a5ewag,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a5ewag/i_cant_get_over_shaktikanta_das_being_appointed/,116,"I flaired this as Business/Finance. I guess it should be Politics and Non Politics as well.

IAS officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead. Now from RR, we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo execution.

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. We just don't have daily interaction with the RBI, so most don't know or care. RBI policies and actions affect everything. And I mean everything! As if demo isn't a good example of that.",badger991," It's very simple.

The only reason Urjit Patel, who offered no resistance to the government's draconian demonetisation move, flipped out when the government asked the RBI to loosen its reserves is even he realises how dangerous a move this is.

Jaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the RBI has 3 lakh crores of ""surplus"" when in actuality, it's ""reserves"". No one knows when the economy will go haywire.

The world's best economists didn't see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!

And since Urjit didn't bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.

The replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.

Mr. Das with his master's in history will offer nothing but support to the government's ideas.

Modi wants the reserves to come out, creating a temporary surge in growth. He will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 Elections.

If these things happen, he truly will have fucked up the economy. I'm buying lube and preparing my anus. Demo 2.0 is right around the corner They got Das for one simple reason. For the ~~1 lakh~~ 3 lakh crore that Jaitley and gang are eyeing. 

The request for that money to be given from RBI reserve, will come in a week or two. 

In a month, there’ll be more loans being dolled out by banks, more mudi kaka posters, more photo ops, more statues of mudi kaka himself if possible and Ofcourse, for ram mandir. 

These people will leave the country in ashes.  I have one request from all of you(people who understand beyond Mandir-Masjid, BJP-Cong). Start educating people on our parliamentary system about MLAs MPs start with your friends, your domestic help tell them how it is done, counsel them(not on which party to vote for but how it affects them). 

Let's start something from our side to save whatever we have left! [deleted] >What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. 

I hope the opposition takes to the social media and tells us what these people are up to. Most of us have a bare minimum education in matters of economics.  [removed] He's got a history degree and has no idea about the economics. He's a government yes man,a puppet.

The government wants to take a huge risk and damage the countries financial stability,in return for short term gains.

The movement of wealth from cash to bonds shows that this is just too risky Dude is MA History.  All his predecessors have been PhD in Economics and Banking.  He is just a Jately lapdog.   Why do you think Dr. Kurian didn't think highly of IAS folks, they are generalists not specialists. Das will help with the looting, this is their second attempt at demo to financially hamstring the opposition and slurp the RBI reserve. Our stewards have turned weak and spineless like Theoden. A reminder to everyone.  RBI asked PayTM to remove the CEO of Paytm payment bank because she did not have any banking experience. And now Jately ji has brought in a no banking experience/no economist(MA History) to head RBI. They think we are retarded. 

And to reply to another comment, these sarkari training certificates have no weight what so ever. I did an MBA from one of these Indian Institute tags and we train many a sarkari afsars usually IAS,IRS and IFS. They just have to attend a few sessions and they get the certificate. Getting a PhD from Yale or Harvard or MIT involves original research work. 

And on top of everything this dude implemented demonetisation.  No economist worth their salt would have let this happen.  I'm not worried if some person without some academic background gets appointed as the Governor of RBI as long as his actions are carefully considered and sane. Also, as other commenter pointed out, it's the board members who make the decisions collectively and we have experts from different fields of study in the board.

With all that said, it's still a very bad decision made by the government. I mean, it's not unexpected that they chose someone who supported the DeMon to the core despite its serious flaws. Also, his politically conservative attitude which he fearlessly displayed in the past is something that's troubling regarding his appointment. I'm supportive of people with very little or no academic background but with sufficient experience working in different related fields of relevance making it into key positions in apex level organizations but this man is clearly chosen with a different motive in mind.

As for the boards and its members being key decisions makers in the organization, I won't be surprised if they're to replaced with other like minded experts as our newly appointed governor if the present members show any kind of disappointment in the decision taking. No organization is devoid of factions but what we've seen till now is that these apex organizations were given a significant freedom to operate on those level of factions that were divided on academic grounds which is undeniably a healthy division. But the recent divisions that developed within the organization are toxic to this organization and thereby to the country as a whole because the core ideology is that of political, rather than being an economic or social one.

This appointment is very much like the appointment of Betsy DeVos as US secretary of education or Kavanaugh's appointment to the US Supreme Court. Abuse of power and unhealthy political involvement in matters that are unrelated. Let's see how this will unfold in times to come.  To me, it matters less what his academic or research credentials are. A lot of people with less formal credentials can do good jobs. What matters more is that he is a Government stooge. Totally agree with you. Mr Das has corruption allegations against him as well.  Pre 2014 RBI was eyeing implementation of basel norms, and now RBI itself is getting its ""pillars"" stripped 😑 He was mouthpiece of government during demo. It's election time and government will try everything possible to remain in power.

RBI reserves will be used as election funds. Loan wievers, ect . Will there be any announcements or news once he hands over a part of the reserve to Mudi Kaka and Blog minister?  I dunno but I get the hunch that even this guy will not be able to tolerate the PM and his gang's nonsense and he will also leave.. Generally (historically) how much time the previous governments taken to decide on the next governer? Daru will help to get over someone 😂 Nothing surprising saar. Inmates running the asylum is trademark of bjp Guys, he's an alumnus of IPE and has a masters in finance from there it seems. Just saying, not stating he's the guy for the job at all, cause he's not. ITT posters citing Wikipedia as source for Shaktikanta Das's qualifications. SMH vigorously.  tax payers are fcuked Why do you bring the rape analogy here! \>   Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit. 

I definitely do not agree with this. The Harvard passouts I have personally met so far have been bitter disappointments. Mostly because expectations from such people are high but also they are usually not experts in their fields or really intend to be. I dont have enough knowledge to say whether this is a good thing or not, But atleast his wikipedia page seem to indicate that he has done schooling in Finance in IIMB and National Institute of Banking Management. He also had held posts in various government revenue organizations.  Not sure, if these are good enough but i dont think they just appointed a guy with just MA History degree as RBI governor. He seems to have some relevant qualification and experience. He has experience in economics related field. PhD in economics doesn't means that you should be selected. Even Raghuram  pursued IIT and later did MBA. Did he had an economic background from the start? No.

This guy might not be the best option but let the guy even work. I know he is a puppet of the government but give some time at least. Turns out he does have a background in finance and management education as suggested by his Wikipedia page To be fair, RBI is supposed to serve the government. If urjit wasn't doing what the government was asking then they have the right to replace him. Because we will blame the government for poor economic policies and vote them out, not the RBI.

Bolo kaunsi chahiye 🤣 I know of two such men, both my friend's uncles. 

They're both Muslims from Hyderabad. 

One uncle married a Gujarati Hindu (she had to convert). The wife is a US citizen. Her family has businesses in Chicago and this guy inherited those too. They have two kids. As far as I know, their marriage works well enough. 

Another uncle married an American born daughter of Pakistani Muslim immigrants. She doesn't follow Islam and drinks alcohol, which this guy didn't like, but still went ahead with the marriage. She turned out to be very abusive. The guy was admitted twice to a hospital during the few years of their marriage. He has a son, so he's staying in the marriage for his sake. It's not unheard of when one partner is Indian origin person who got citizenship earlier. Infact, a close friend of mine got into an arranged marriage with a keralite girl with British citizenship and moved. It's probably more common among keralites though. They're experts in migration. I did it. My wife is actually an ex Victoria's Secret model as well. That seems to be one nasty way to emigrate. I believe women might have more chances than men.

GST: Firms looking for a way to change their GST officials,19,7ohp21,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/firms-fret-over-raw-gst-officials-seek-to-get-them-changed/articleshow/62386197.cms,2,,madamplease," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**Firms looking for a way to change their GST officials** 

 ______ 
A senior finance executive in a private equity firm was visibly worried after
he got a call from goods and services tax (

GST

) officer. The officer on the other end wanted to know more about the
construction business that the company was involved in. It took some time for
the executive to explain that the word ""stone"" in the brand name had nothing
to do with the business the firm was into.

Few kilometres away from the PE firm's office in

Mumbai

, the CFO of a finance company -- that's part of a major conglomerate -- was
nervous too. The CFO was just back from a meeting with the company's

GST assessing officer

, and it left him in knots.

""How does one explain credit

swap

ratio, private placement, and other debt instruments in Hindi?"" he asked his
chartered accountant who had accompanied him. The GST officer too had some
queries about some transactions that were carried out in the past few months.

As the government assigned GST assessing officers from a combined pool of
erstwhile Sales Tax, Excise and Value Added Tax (VAT) officers, many companies
are running scared. Earlier, state officers --mainly VAT -- only dealt with
manufacturing companies and service tax, and excise officials dealt with
service companies including banks, PE firms, NBFCs and insurance companies.

But under GST -- the common indirect tax -- that distinction has disappeared
and all officers now fall under one umbrella. So in several cases, erstwhile
VAT officials have been asked to assess PE firms, banks and finance companies.

Many of these firms are rushing to their tax consultants and desperately
asking them if they can in anyway change their assessing officers.

""There's no mechanism prescribed by the legislation that enables taxpayers to
voice their views on whether they would prefer being assessed by the existing
authorities.

Several service providers, whose business models are well known to the central
authorities and have now been assigned to the state authorities, are
apprehensive that the state authorities will take time to develop expertise on
taxation of services,"" said MS Mani, Partner, Deloitte

India

.

Industry trackers say that for indirect taxes, the importance of assessment
officers become crucial and dealing with them is not just an annual affair
like in the case of income tax. ""One has to deal with officials for refunds,
credits, monthly taxes, etc. The worry is many VAT officials will take some
time before they could understand nitty-gritty of our business,"" the senior
finance executive in the PE firm said.

The government has used a formula for allocation of assessment officers and
dividing work among central and state officers. And this is worrying not just
for PE firms or banks, but also some of the other traders.

Take the instance of an Indian shoe manufacturer that has a turnover of about
Rs 1,000 crore: the manufacturer has got a clean chit from the VAT officials
for the past five years, but is now worried about the heightened scrutiny.

Another diamond exporter based in Crawford Market in Mumbai has also sent out
an SOS to his tax advisors. The exporter, like the shoe manufacturer, wants
former state officers to assess his accounts, and not central officers.

The manufacturer has asked his tax advisors to figure out a way to change his
assessing officer back to what they were. Many say that these worries are
somewhat unfounded. ""Many companies have been approaching and making pleas of
changing their assessing officers, which is not possible. Every officer has
undergone training and there is no need to worry,"" a government official in
the know clarified.

""Most former VAT officials had until now dealt with indirect taxes on goods
and they would now be dealing with services. Although many of these officials
were given training, there would be a learning curve and this has worried
several services companies that have been assigned to state authorities,"" said
Sachin Menon, national head, indirect tax,

KPMG India

.

The worries may not be unfounded. Tax experts point out that indirect tax is a
complex subject. ""One of my clients, an IT firm, had received a notice because
the tax officer wanted a copy of an airfare receipt,"" he laughs. ""However, I
would say many officers would go easy on companies whose business models they
don't understand, and it may just be a good thing.""

But not everyone is convinced as some officers are already asking questions
which are making some companies jittery. Take the example of a law firm. The
tax officer wanted to know about each transaction leading to revenue of the
firm (although law firms are exempted from GST). The officer wanted to know
how come the head of the law firm was charging a fee of Rs 2 lakh for ""merely
talking for half an hour"" from a client, but not charging anything from
another client with whom she had spoken for two hours.

""It's not the law alone, the procedure of indirect taxes, especially GST, is
complex. It would have been great if officers who have no experience were
allotted smaller companies or firms for initial few years,"" a senior tax
advisor said.

  NEW DELHI: Apple wants the government to relax labelling rules so that it doesn't have to print product-related information directly onto devices to avoid cluttering up their minimalist design. That's one of the concessions Apple has sought after expressing its intention to start manufacturing in India, an official said.  

 

  The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) forwarded the iPhone maker’s request to the Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeITY) in November for consideration, said another official. The company manufactures its products in six countries, with most being made in China.  

 

  

 

 

  Apple's distinctive design language is integral to product appeal and it strives to keep surfaces as free of artefacts as possible. The company wants to provide the product details that are required by law in India as part of the software of the device or on the packaging. The labelling issue will be dealt with by DeITY, the official said.  

 

  The company has also sought tax incentives that are being examined by the finance ministry. The government currently provides subsidies for investments in special economic zones in order to woo investors. Apple did not respond to queries.  

 

  The finance ministry had rejected an earlier proposal by Apple to set up wholly owned outlets in the country that sought exemption from the compulsory 30% local sourcing norm. The company had sought the exemption on the grounds that it was bringing ""state-of-the-art"" and “cutting-edge technology,"" making it difficult to meet the sourcing condition.

Fitch Rating (Representational Image) Fitch Rating (Representational Image)

Despite a continued pitch from the government and corporates for an upgrade, global rating agency Fitch Ratings has kept its sovereign rating on India unchanged, citing weak public finances. In its latest rating review, Fitch acknowledged India’s strong growth and recent economic reforms but maintained that the state of the government’s finances do not justify an upgrade. Fitch affirmed India’s sovereign rating at BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating. The outlook on India’s rating remains stable, with the agency saying that upside and downside risks to the sovereign rating are broadly balanced.

India’s long-term foreign and local-currency issuer default ratings were also at ‘BBB-’. “India’s sovereign ratings balance a strong medium-term growth outlook and favourable external balances with a weak fiscal position and difficult business environment. However, the business environment is likely to gradually improve with the implementation and continued broadening of the government’s structural reform agenda,” it said. On Monday, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had said, “Why is India, the fastest growing emerging economy for over one year now with all macroeconomic fundamentals being positive, rated just BBB-? On the other hand, Italy and Spain, which are far weaker and smaller, are having much higher ratings than us.”

“Italian banks are in far worse shape than our banks. Italian government is more shaky and we have a solid political stability now,” he had said. According to Fitch, weak public finances continue to constrain India’s ratings, with a high general government debt burden of 67.9 per cent of GDP (‘BBB’ median: 40.9 per cent) and wide fiscal balance of -6.6 per cent of GDP as estimated by Fitch for FY17. However, there are some early indications that fiscal policy might become more focussed on bringing down debt, it said.

Fitch said India’s economy is less developed on a number of structural metrics than many of its peers. Average per capita GDP remains low at $1,714, compared with the ‘BBB’ range median of $9,701. Governance standards also remain weak, as illustrated by a low score for the World Bank governance indicator (46th percentile versus the ‘BBB’ median of 58th percentile).

An official committee reviewing the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act has recommended lowering government debt to 60 per cent of GDP. “It remains uncertain if the government will commit to the target suggested by the committee, but in his February 2017 budget speech, the finance minister explicitly recognised the low number of direct taxpayers, stating that India is “largely a tax non-compliant society”, which is a significant change in rhetoric. The central government’s FY18 budget also continues its gradual consolidation efforts irrespective of the difficult trade-off with the desire to spur infrastructure spending,” Fitch said.

“Significant contingent liabilities for the sovereign continue to emanate from public sector banks. The banking sector’s non-performing assets (NPAs) problem is well recognised by authorities, but continues to linger,” it said. Fitch expects NPAs to rise to 9.7 per cent of total loans by end-FY17, from 4.6 per cent in FY15, due mainly to stricter implementation of standards.

**Stand-up India: Key to developing entrepreneurs from underprivileged sections of society is mentoring** 

 ______ 
Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India’s youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood.

Indian startups have captured global attention, attracted venture capital and achieved notable success in recent years. Such an effort if replicated at scale for underprivileged sections of society can have a catalytical impact on job generation in the country. While new entrepreneurship requires a supportive environment for finance and facilitative administrative procedures, creating large-scale entrepreneurship across the country additionally necessitates special measures for addressing capacity gaps among prospective entrepreneurs. Mentorship and effective links with financial institutions can play a key role in this endeavour.

Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India’s youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood. According to the Sixth Economic Census conducted in 2013-14, there were about 58 million establishments in the country, employing some 130 million workers. Manufacturing, retail trade and livestock farming were the top three activities as per the Census. In addition, the shared economy fostered through online and telecom platforms too creates new opportunities for small and tiny businesses to generate rising income opportunities.

In the Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), we have seen instructive examples of the impact that mentors can have on entrepreneurs from weaker sections of the society. Starting in 1992, BYST has helped establish 5,500 entrepreneurs through mentorship, creating about 2.5 lakh jobs. Tusshar Munoat from a poor farmer family of Maharashtra was identified as a potential entrepreneur, in one instance, and linked with a mentor who helped him to obtain finance for applying for government tenders in road construction. Munoat had maintained good accounting records and followed practices such as stock movement registers which made it easier to get the loan. With strict control on raw material quality and adherence to contractual conditions, he built lasting roads, providing employment to over 1,000 people from neighboring villages.

Helping such young entrepreneurs convert their ideas into viable business enterprises under the guidance of mentors who double up as incubators for their new ventures can enable these job seekers become job creators. The new entrepreneurs need complete support and training, inspiration and networking and must be nurtured until they reach a level where they are not only self-sufficient, but in turn are able to do their bit for society by creating wealth and employment.

Mentors, too, should be selected carefully and trained with certification. Under the BYST program, each enterprise is assigned an individual mentor who provides personalised advice, tracks business growth and helps solve problems. Counselling and mentoring is needed right from product identification to scaling up and long-term growth.

Another example is of Bhaskar Tamuli from Assam, who wished to set up an enterprise to revive the traditional craft of bell metal. Lacking information on how to set up an enterprise, he needed counselling, training, and support to prepare the project report, and follow up with the financing bank. The designated mentor was able to work with Tamuli to obtain a loan and go on to maintain proper accounts, improve product design, link with markets lineage, manage employees, and conduct other essential business processes. This can have a cascading impact as well. Tamuli further encouraged 300 other persons to set up business, and is now considering exports. He has also ventured into training of local workers and has become a mentor himself.

Such handholding of entrepreneurs who lack the necessary knowledge is particularly important to encourage women entrepreneurship. Women face additional societal norms and family pressures which hinder their venturing into business. However, the micro-finance movement has demonstrated that they can be effective income-earners, given the right support.

Shanmugadevi Lakshmana Perumal conquered all odds to set up Swasti Support Services Pvt Ltd, which provides integrated facilities management services to corporates, IT Parks, hotels, etc. BYST helped in securing a loan from the Bharatiya Mahila Bank, Chennai. After the Chennai floods devastated her enterprise, more mentoring enabled her to stand on her feet again by launching a new brand logo, website and marketing collateral for ‘Vivikura’. Another inspirational example is of Archana Parmathayalan who started a catering enterprise providing food for boys living in hostels.Her mentor helped her streamline the processes, improve efficiency, maintain financial records, and undertake financial forecasting, even obtaining ISO certification in the process.

We have found that the mentors too derive high personal satisfaction in voluntarily assisting entrepreneurs in building new livelihood opportunities. The mentors tend to remain in the program and take several new enterprises to successful maturity without expectation of returns. BYST has a cadre of over 4,500 mentors who devote time, energy and expertise to ensure success for entrepreneurs from weaker sections of society.

Under the Government’s MUDRA Yojana, Startup India and other programs, entrepreneurship creation is receiving the same policy attention as job generation. However, the lack of formal training and absence of information on how to set up a business hampers this effort. With a mass mentoring movement and spread of incubation to rural India, we could see a flowering of entrepreneurship at all levels.

**‘The party will be over’: How GST will affect businesses that don’t pay tax** 

 ______ 
Rakesh Sachdeva sells auto parts in a busy market in central Delhi, just a few miles from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office. Yet despite having a flourishing business he does not pay any tax.

Until now, his rundown premises and small scale operation has kept the business below the radar of India’s tax officials. Come July 1, however, “the party will be over”, says the 51-year-old, with a resigned shrug.

A nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST), set to come into effect on Saturday, has faced criticism for its complex design. But the country’s biggest tax reform since independence is promising to bring millions of firms like Sachdeva’s into the tax net, boosting government revenues and India’s sovereign credit profile.

The new tax will require firms to upload their invoices every month to a portal that will match them with those of their suppliers or vendors.

Because a tax number is needed for a firm to claim a credit on the cost of its inputs, many companies are refusing to buy from unregistered businesses. Those who don’t sign up risk losing any customer who has.

“I have no option, but to register with the new system,” said Sachdeva, who spoke to Reuters on condition the name and precise location of his shop were not disclosed.

Boosting the coffers

Improved tax compliance should shore up public finances, augmenting resources for welfare and development spending and giving a lift to the $2 trillion economy.

India currently has one of the worst tax-to-GDP ratios among major economies at 16.6%, less the half the 34 percent average for the members of the OECD and also below many emerging economies.

While there is no official estimate of the potential fiscal gain, some tax experts say the measure, after the initial teething trouble, would lift the tax-to-GDP ratio by as much as 4 percentage points as the number of tax filers is estimated to more than treble to 30 million.

“In future, compliance is going to be extremely crucial,” Rajiv Nair, chief executive officer at Kaya Ltd., told Reuters. “Since we are also responsible for compliance across the supply chain, we have to ensure that the suppliers we have are in a position to work with us in a compliant manner.”

Nair’s company, which makes beauty and personal care products, has just streamlined its supply chain, dropping vendors that were not going to be GST-compliant.

Other companies are doing the same. Elior Group, a French catering and food service company, said it has mandated GST-compliance as one of the eligibility criteria for its orders.

A REVAMP 17 YEARS IN THE MAKING India is all set to keep its July 1 date with the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a reform that has been in the making for 17 years. GST will unify India into one market place with one uniform tax, shore up government revenue and is expected to spur economic growth. Timeline of the long journey to GST rollout:

Winners and losers

The unorganised sector of India’s economy is vast, employing an estimated nine out of 10 workers.

While staying outside the GST regime risks losing business, joining it will necessitate an overhaul of firms’ accounting systems and an investment in technology.

The new tax system requires three filing a month plus an annual return - a total of 37 filings - for each of India’s 29 states in which a firm operates. For smaller companies operating on wafer thin margins, hiring accountants and technical staff could substantially dent their bottom line.

Sanjiv Mehra, head of a traders’ body in Delhi, reckons a “prohibitive” cost could prove to be counterproductive.

“Compliance is needed for input tax credit,” he said. “But what if you are in a business where margins are strong and allows you to forsake credit?”

But despite its flaws, many analysts think the new tax will be good news for bigger established businesses, because it will sweep away an array of federal and state sales taxes, levied at different stages of the supply chain, that often result in double taxation.

The government estimates the GST will save companies around $14 billion because it will allow them to organise their warehouses and supply chains more efficiently.

Firms can now move to demand-based “hub-and-spoke” models used globally, rather than operating state-by-state.

“Those companies which can wring out the maximum cost efficiency are the ones investors should bet on,” said Ajay Bodke, head of portfolio management services at financial firm Prabhudas Lilladher in Mumbai. “All consumer-facing industries will be big beneficiaries of the GST.”

Didn't these firms have a sales tax number before?

Companies buying from them earlier would have surely shown whatever they purchased as expenses in their tax filing (I am not talking about tax credit, just expenses in a P & L statement). Now for showing these purchases as expenses, they would have needed a bill/receipt/invoice from these firms. For that these firms would need to have a Sales Tax Number.

**Au Small Finance Bank IPO; here’s what 8 brokerages say** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: AU Small Finance Bank is all set to hit the market with an initial public offering ( IPO ) on Wednesday. On offer are 53.42 million shares in the price band of Rs 355-358 apiece. The issue will close on Friday.The Jaipur-based company, which has got RBI licence to engage in small finance banking, has already commenced operations. With a network of 300 branches spread across Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Chhattisgarh, the lender used to serve across 10 states as a non-banking finance company ( NBFC ) – AU Financiers – before foraying into the small finance bank space.Here’s what brokerages said on the IPO:AU Small Finance Bank (AU SFB) is a small finance bank that recently transitioned from a retail-focused NBFC and primarily serves low and middle income individuals and businesses. Started in 1996, the company’s business primarily was focused on vehicle finance. The company later ventured into MSME and SME loans. AU SFB commenced business as a small finance bank on April 19, 2017. The transition to SFB has offered AU SFB significant growth potential and will help deliver improved performance and return ratios. At the upper band of the price band at Rs 358, the post-money valuation of AU SFB is at 5.3 times P/ABV FY17 of Rs 68, which we believe, leaves little scope for any upside in the near term. Hence we recommend investors to subscribe to the issue only with a long-term investment horizon.AU SFB’s gross AUM has grown at a CAGR of 30 per cent over FY13-17 on account of sectoral tail winds such as a financial inclusion drive and low credit penetration in certain areas of the country. These growth drivers are likely to persist over the longer term. As a result, AU SFB should continue its record high growth rate on its loan book.Further, AU SFB has successfully diversified its loan book composition that has helped it reduce concentration risk and improve asset quality. Out of the total loan book, 98.99 per cent is backed by revenue-generating assets. Also, LTVs of 80-85 per cent on showroom prices for vehicles loans and 40 per cent for MSME/SME loans are indicative of high-quality loan underwriting and risk management practices at AU SFB.Its initiation into housing finance and unsecured lending in FY18 should aid further diversification of the loan book. Given that the management has strong operational experience in housing finance and has an excellent track record of scaling up the same, we are confident that its initiation of housing finance will only add to profitable growth for AU SFB besides achieving diversification and risk management objectives. AU SFB has also displayed strong focus on optimising costs to keep profitability levels high. At the upper end of the price band of Rs 358, issue is priced at 5.1 times FY17 book value. Based on the management’s successful track-record of scaling up the business over the years, generating high returns (better RoAE than peers), focus on optimising costs, well-established framework for controlling asset quality and well-thought-out future expansion strategy, we recommend subscribe rating to long-term investors.In its earlier avatar as an NBFC, AU grew its gross loan assets and earnings at a robust CAGR of 34 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively, over FY14-17. The brisk AUM growth was complemented by its business diversity, both in terms of products and geographies. Profitability grew by leaps and bounds, notwithstanding persistent investments on the back of moderation in funding cost and firm control on product pricing.Post SFB launch, growth and profitability would be restricted; but the longer-run prospects seem bright. Its conversion into SFB will augment earnings diversity and stability. The IPO of 53.4 million shares is a 100 per cent offer for sale; with the promoters divesting 9 million shares after which they would bring down their holding to 33 per cent.At the upper end of the price band of Rs 355-358, the stock is being valued at 5.3 times FY17 P/ABV. In our view, this valuation, more than being palatable, offers a material upside post listing. We recommend a subscribe rating.While the trailing valuation of 5.1 times FY17 P/BV may look expensive after taking a first look, this is a unique model with no exact peers. An important distinguishing factor is that Au SFB is a small finance bank and can raise deposits to keep the cost of funds low, unlike its peers. Therefore, the SFB model should do better compared to the NBFC model in the long run.At the upper end of the price band, the company is valued at a P/BV of 5.1 times on FY17, which is relatively higher than the peer group NBFCs. However, given the consistent track record of AU delivering high growth, better RoAs with contained asset quality issues vs peers, AU commands a premium valuation. At the offered valuation, we recommend a subscribe rating on the issue with a long-term view.Given the strong presence in niche customer segments, AU SFB’s profitability will be remain superior to most conventional banks, said the brokerage. “Despite the migration to SFB, we estimate that AU will report trough RoEs of 17 per cent in FY18 this will recover to 20 per cent by FY20. This is significantly better than its listed peers which are currently reporting single digit RoEs. As such, valuations at 3.2 times book on FY20 are reasonable, and investors can expect strong upside over the next few years,” it said.Its evolution from a DSA of HDFC Bank to a significant retail lending NBFC and outstanding performance track record suggest AU SFB has the potential to emerge as one of the most successful SFBs in three to five years. “We expect AU SFB to attract higher valuation premium compared to its peers led by sustainability of high growth in diversified business amid lower assets quality risk. At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, AU SFB’s market capitalisation would stand at Rs 102 billion, which gives it a price-to-book multiple of 5.1 times on March 2017 book value and P/E of 31.2 times on FY17 profit. We recommend subscribe rating to the issue, as it provides a favourable investment opportunity for long-term investors.At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, the issue is offered at 5.1 times its FY2017 BV. However, AU has reported a strong 48 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2013-17. “We believe it has the potential to deliver 30 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2017-19. Based on our quick estimates on FY2019 BV, the issue is offered at 3.5 times. While the issue is offered at premium valuations, we believe the valuation is justified given the historical track record and strong growth potential that SFB offers. We recommend subscribe rating on the issue,” the brokerage said.

RBI revises definition of what constitutes a bank branch,26,6c1xto,http://www.livemint.com/Industry/FojmHPxmE5QgaXMFzm3YuM/RBI-redefines-what-constitutes-a-bank-branch.html,1,,HornOK," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**RBI revises definition of what constitutes a bank branch**

Reserve Bank of India (RBI), apart from reworking the definition of a bank branch, also widened the role of bank boards, making them responsible for complying with the new guidelines. Photo: Mint

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday relaxed the branch authorization policy, bringing all branches and fixed business correspondent outlets under the definition of banking outlets and removing restrictions on opening branches in Tier 1 centres.

According to the revised policy, RBI has defined “a banking outlet” for a scheduled commercial, a payments bank or a small finance bank as a fixed point service delivery unit, manned by either the bank’s staff or its business correspondent, where services of acceptance of deposits, encashment of cheques, cash withdrawal or lending of money are provided for a minimum of 4 hours per day for at least five days a week”. Those outlets which do not meet this criteria will be called “part-time banking outlet.”

While the policy has removed restrictions on opening banking outlets in Tier 1 to Tier 6 centres without taking RBI’s permission in each case, the regulator has mandated that banks open 25% of these outlets in unbanked rural centres (URC). Under the revised policy, a URC is defined as a “rural (Tier 5 and 6) centre that does not have a core banking system (CBS)-enabled ‘banking outlet’ of a scheduled commercial bank, a small finance bank, a payment bank or a regional rural bank nor a branch of local area bank or licensed co-operative bank for carrying out customer based banking transactions”.

With the expansion in definition of a branch, RBI has allowed all extension counters, satellite offices, part-shifted branches, ultra small branches and specialized branches, to be treated as ‘banking outlets’ or ‘part-time banking outlets’. However, ATMs, E-lobbies, bunch note acceptor machines ,cash deposit machines, e- kiosks and mobile branches will fall outside the purview of “banking outlets”. This is a shift from the earlier definition of a “branch” which also included off-site ATMs.

The proposal to rationalise the branch authorization policy was introduced under former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan in the April 2016 monetary policy. “With a view to facilitating financial inclusion and providing flexibility on the choice of delivery channel, it is proposed to redefine branches and permissible methods of outreach, keeping in mind the various attributes of the banks and the types of services that are sought to be provided,” RBI had said in the policy statement.

Later an internal working group was set up, which came out with the draft report in October 2016. The key focus of the recommendations was to facilitate financial inclusion by ensuring availability of banking services in all centers through low-cost delivery channels.

The revised policy has also allowed small finance banks three years from the date of commencement of business to align their banking network with the extant guidelines. Till such time, the existing structures may continue and would be treated as “banking outlets” though not immediately reckoning for the 25% norm. “Nevertheless, during this period of three years, for all the banking outlets opened or converted from the existing MFI branches in a year, they will have to open 25% banking outlets in unbanked rural centres in the same year,” RBI said.

“This policy will help in further penetration in rural areas and increase the profitability of the organization. We expect 10-15% more growth in the business with same set of branches we have projected,” said Munish Jain, chief operating officer of Capital Small Finance Bank.

not really indian context, but overall good resource for Finance/Banking 101 So disappointed with this thread! Really thought I'll get better answers than taking courses and reading textbooks. 

I feel the same way as you OP. I just don't know how to manage money and my biggest nightmare is that someone will cheat me out of it because I am too naive. Currently I get more than 5 calls per week asking me to invest in FDs at my bank. I have no idea about interest rates, I didnt even know my current balance earns an interest. I'd like some ""smart"" folk here to explain where I could invest my savings in a super simple but efficient way. I aint got no time to read my high school economics textbooks again. Seriously I don't remember a thing although I aced it. ;)

Recently I had to file taxes at my company and realised my parents have manipulated my name in not having a single thing to claim tax. I just sat down and wondered wtf is happening. Needless to say I couldn't claim. I have a pan card but it was handed to me by my dad who got it all done. So no fucking idea what happened there. 

I request someone here to tell me brielfly about things I discussed. (no links) thankyou! Search for business insider 25 most useful websites.1 site among that list teaches finance. Also add Taxation ,shares ,investment etc :) TTC lectures money and banking(paid)


Khan academy > To be more clear, I am a medical student

Consider finances and investing as a complex system (like the human body). Like for a healthy life, you don't *need* to understand the intricacies of the workings of the human body, similarly for good financial management and investing, you don't need to understand how and why of all those changes. 

> I don't know how or why the rates of oil, gold and the value of money changes, 

Most people, including investors, don't understand the reasons of those either. Don't go by the financial news networks explanations ex post facto. 

For the modern monetary system working, check out [this research article](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1905625). This is posted in terms of the US system, but applies on India too. 

> how the bank works 

Banks take money from the depositors (as money in the savings and current accounts, FD, etc) and lend them to those who need it. In the middle of this, they have their margin. Eg, the highest FD rates would be 8-9% while the lowest lending rates would be 11-13% (so the gap of 3-4% is their profit margin). This is the most basic idea.

**Regulatory reform fails to cut red tape: NITI Aayog**

The survey conducted by NITI Aayog and IDFC Institute reveals that the experience of regulatory reform has not been uniform across the country. Graphic: Mint

New Delhi: The big push by central and state governments to ease the regulatory environment notwithstanding, the perception of most business enterprises is that little has changed on the ground, a new survey has found.

The nationwide survey of the organized manufacturing sector was conducted jointly by the NITI Aayog and IDFC Institute, a Mumbai-based think tank, to monitor the business environment in the country. It surveyed 3,276 enterprises, including 141 early-stage firms, across 23 categories.

Not only do the survey results serve as a wake-up call to the government and a reminder that the legacy of red tape is far more difficult to undo than what has been thought so far, it also reveals that the experience of regulatory reform has not been uniform across the country.

The results released on Monday showed that for a majority of respondents, parameters such as setting up a business, land and construction, environment, labour, water and sanitation, taxes, and access to finance remained the same compared with a year ago; on legal matters, they reported that things had worsened. The survey was conducted in 2016.

To be sure, a little over a third of the respondents did say that there was an improvement in ease of doing business, while about a fifth said procedures had deteriorated.

While 38% of the enterprises said that the regulatory environment for setting up a business had improved, the same proportion claimed nothing had changed and 21% said it had worsened. A large proportion (44%) of the enterprises said the regulatory framework for getting environment clearances had stayed the same while only 17% said it had worsened. Around 36% of the enterprises said that legal processes for resolving disputes had worsened while only 25% said they had improved. About 46% of enterprises said that access to finance had stayed the same while 36% said it had improved.

The World Bank, in its Doing Business survey report released last year, offered a plausible explanation. “The experience of implementing reforms based on doing business data has demonstrated to the government the significance of establishing clear stakeholder feedback mechanisms to close the gaps between policy formulation and implementation,” it said.

India’s ranking in the World Bank’s annual Doing Business survey improved by just one notch to 130 in its 2017 report from a revised rank of 131 last year. India is targeting a 40-notch jump in ranking in the upcoming survey, which is expected to be released in October.

The NITI Aayog-IDFC Institute survey also found that a substantial chunk of the enterprises surveyed were not aware of many of the improvements undertaken both by the Union and state governments.

On average, only about 20% of manufacturing start-ups were using the single-window facilities introduced by state governments for setting up a business. Even among experts, only 41% had any knowledge of the existence of these facilities. “Therefore, there is a clear need for creating greater awareness. In cases in which the lack of use is due to poor functioning of the service, the functioning must be improved,” the survey recommended.

Conceding that there was a communication gap, a person involved in overseeing the survey said that “every single company needs to be told about the changes taking place”.

Based on the results, the survey recommends more flexible labour laws to allow businesses to gain economies of scale. It also makes a strong case for states to open up their power distribution sector to private competition to lower costs and improve reliability.

Some analysts disagreed with the findings, claiming that the business climate has actually improved. “The robust inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) despite volatile global macroeconomic situation reflects the overall improvement in ease of doing business in India,” said N.R. Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a think tank.

FDI inflow in the April-June quarter jumped 37% to $10.7 billion compared with $7.6 billion received in the same period a year ago.

Commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who released the survey along with information and technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, said improving ease of doing business is getting the central government’s full attention.

**Banks wary of Modi government's merger plan for fear of loss of brand name** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The government is looking at consolidation of at least two state-run banks in this financial year, but some of the lenders identified for merger or takeover by bigger entities have expressed serious reservations on their identities being subsumed in the process.The target banks are keen that their names survive the consolidation and they continue to have a strong role in business operations, officials said. Earlier this year, four state-run banks – Syndicate Bank, Canara Bank, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank – made presentations to the finance ministry on their consolidation plans.“We have worked out some combinations. This involves a larger bank taking over two smaller entities.Also, there is a case for merging two smaller but strong banks. We can look at some hybrid names which retain characters of the both banks,” said a government official, who did not wish to be identified.The official cited the case of the merger between Centurion Bank and Bank of Punjab that led to the creation of a new entity, Centurion Bank of Punjab, which later merged with HDFC Bank in 2008.Senior executives of the banks being considered for consolidation have told the finance ministry that the brand names of the lenders have deep-rooted association with their borrowers and the loss of brand names could potentially affect business. Vijaya Bank, for instance, was set up in 1931. Syndicate Bank, set up in 1925, was earlier known as Canara Industrial and Banking Syndicate Ltd.Experts, however, said the merger exercise should not be delayed only because of brand issues.“These are state-run lenders. The borrowers are aware of this and there is no possibility of losing business just because a lender reinvented its brand name,” said MP Shorawala, a former independent director with Central Bank of India. “We already have a successful example in case of Axis Bank.”In 2007, UTI Bank rechristened itself as Axis Bank. “The idea was to get a grasp on the issues which could come up during the merger exercise,” the official cited earlier said, adding that some of the factors taken into consideration for merger are the business mix, the information technology platform that the banks are operating on and the geographical spread.In April, State Bank of India absorbed five of its associate lenders and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, creating a larger bank that accounts for a quarter of all outstanding loans. There are 21 state-run banks in India.In June, after reviewing the quarterly performance of public sector banks, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government was “actively working” towards consolidation but did not share any details, stating this was price-sensitive information.The government is also undertaking a simultaneous exercise to assess the capital requirements of state-run banks. “We are waiting for the first quarter results.Once that happens, we will allocate further capital based on their requirements,” Jaitley had said at the time.While the government has already allocated Rs 8,000 crore — the spillover from the previous fiscal, this year, it plans to provide another Rs 10,000 crore by way of capital infusion.

The Indian pharmaceutical and healthcare industry has long been dominated by men, a trait it shares with many of its counterparts abroad. But now a big change is sweeping across this immensely technical and challenging business landscape. A new crop of women business leaders has emerged at the top, coming up with game-changing ideas and services in some of India's top pharma and healthcare companies. Their business acumen apart, these women have added tremendous value in shaping their organisations.
 
 They are reinventing age-old practices and promoting diversity to meet challenges and take their companies to the top. Some like Ameera Shah of Metropolis have built the business from scratch while others like Samina Vaziralli of Cipla have been handed the reins of a 75-year-old company. But whether it is building businesses or wading through troubled waters, they have proved their mettle. They are young, but have come of age quickly. They are not afraid of taking business risks or foraying into newer businesses. They have embedded a culture of inclusive environment and pushed for HR reforms targetted at women in the DNA of their companies — who better than them to understand the struggles of juggling family and business. These are their stories.
 
 Our systems have kept pace with growth: Namita Thapar 39 CFO, Emcure Pharmaceuticals
 Key Accomplishment: Expanding global footprint and making five global acquisitions in the past 3-4 year
 Key Challenge: Managing work-life balance. Having to earn the respect from peers who judge her as someone born with a silver spoon 
 
 In 2006, five years after she completed her MBA from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, Namita Thapar got a call from her father Satish Mehta, promoter and CEO of Emcure Pharmaceuticals, to join the family business in Pune. Thapar, a CA by qualification was then working in the healthcare sector in the US — for Glaxo and Guidant (now Abbott) in various finance roles. Emcure had by then received funding from private equity fund Blackstone and had aggressive plans to enter the US market. Mehta felt that with his daughter's US education and experience in the healthcare sector would add value to the business. He persuaded her and her husband to move back to India.
 
 The move paid off. Emcure is one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical companies in India on account of launch of innovative formulations developed by its R&D and marketing strategies designed to build brands. In the last 10 years, it has grown from a Rs 500 crore company to a Rs 4,500 crore entity. ""I can't take all the credit as my brother Samit and husband Vik have added tremendous value too, but believe I have made some good changes based on my experience in the US. All three of us got a lot of autonomy from my father to make changes,"" says Thapar.
 
 Emcure has made five large global acquisitions in the past three years. As CFO, Thapar and her team assisted the M&A team in those deals. ""These strategic acquisitions have significantly expanded our global footprint,"" says Thapar.
 
 At Emcure, Thapar has brought more automation in finance, was closely involved with domestic marketing and helped make meetings more data driven (especially through sales force automation). She also worked with HR to improve critical systems such as appraisal, variable compensation and talent identification. ""I am a strong believer that as a company scales, it needs to become more process driven and develop leadership bandwidth,"" she adds.
 
 Thapar says there are plenty of reasons for more women to join the pharma sector. Functions like quality, finance, marketing, IT, regulatory are great areas for women to work, according to her.
 
 She has launched a program called ""Prerna"" aimed at increasing the representation of women in the company, which has doubled to 20 per cent in the past four years. Emcure has several women in leadership roles in quality, regulatory, marketing, IT, HR and finance, says Thapar.

Should I get an MBA? [NP],7,3ewrql,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ewrql/should_i_get_an_mba_np/,9,"Currently, I am a undergrad student majoring in Finance in Thailand. I will be done in December. I haven’t done 10+2 –> only did the IGCSEs. My dad runs a jewellery business which I will join if I do not go for Masters. I have no prior knowledge about the business and I will move to India to train myself (it has been taken care of).

I am considering an option and would like an opinion on this matter. I was thinking that while I learn my family business under someone else’s guidance, I also prepare myself for CFA. Since I am already a Finance undergrad, I will be furthering my studies in my field of interest. This would mean I can learn about how to handle a business and earn a CFA (provided I pass). But this would also mean boycotting the MBA.

Also, maybe pursue a Gemological Institute of America (GIA) course at some point – although unlikely.

How do you think of my plan? Will it be wise to not pursue MBA? I am uncertain if this is the right way to go and would love to have opinions. ",nosleepnomore," I think your best option would be to opt for an MBA overseas.  If you want to expand your business, work with your dad and join an entrepreneur/Family Business oriented MBA/PGP program. For example, ISB has one http://www.isb.edu/management-programme-for-family-business.

 IMHO, you should go ahead with the MBA. Reasons:

1. It would give you the skillset and network needed to successfully run your dad's business, esp considering that you do not have work ex so far.

2. Even if you plan to stick with finance with the CFA, the MBA will still be a value add as it is highly regarded in finance companies.

A word of advice: Aim high, don't compromise on college because of the high fees. It's not like undergrad, where you can sit in your room at night and catch up on studies even if your profs are no good. In an MBA brand value and peer learning are important. Plus a top tier programme will provide enough return on investment to justify taking an education loan. Instead of CFA or MBA, why don't you try other finance courses too? You can learn with industry experts at Imarticus Learning. They even have placement options, if that is something you are interested in. Visit their website: www.imarticus.org .. They also offer online courses in case you want that flexibility.",Business/Finance,2015-07-28 23:42:50

Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did, said Lula Mohanty, managing partner of IBM Global Business Services. Photo: Reuters

Mumbai: The Mahindra Group and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) will co-develop a blockchain solution, which the companies claim, has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes.

This cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions, Mahindra said in a statement.

The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only its part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information.

Invoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. The solution aims to simplify supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes that have historically been difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers.

Anish Shah, group president (strategy), Mahindra Group, said the group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth.

The company is also actively looking at other applications across the group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech. “This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance’s small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time,” said Shah.

Blockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future.

“Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did,” said Lula Mohanty, managing partner of IBM Global Business Services.

The work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, “and we’re confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well,” he said.

In an interview with Mint in June 2016, Shah said Mahindra is sharpening its focus on digital technologies such as blockchain, Big Data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and even augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), to boost growth.

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s crackdown on the cash economy has shattered the consensus needed for a new national sales tax, plunging his boldest reform into limbo and threatening to entrench an economic slowdown.

Modi’s government already had its work cut out to finalise a deal with India’s 29 federal states to launch a goods and services tax (GST) on 1 April that would transform Asia’s third-largest economy into a single market for the first time.

But his decision to scrap 86% of the cash in circulation, in a bid to purge the economy of “black money”, has caused huge disruption.

A slump in business activity stemming from the cash crunch has caused the revenue of state governments, which collect value-added tax on goods and other duties, to slump by 25-40%.

The states won’t risk another setback by rushing the sales tax into force.

“The investment and economic environment in the country is in bad shape,” said West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra, who earlier head a panel tasked with building a consensus on the GST. “How is the country going to absorb the dual shock of GST and demonetisation?”

The GST is India’s biggest tax overhaul since independence in 1947. It would replace a plethora of federal and state levies with one tax, easing compliance, broadening the revenue base and boosting productivity.

It took Modi more than two years to forge a political compromise on the tax in August. Now, demonetisation “has created a trust deficit,” said Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Isaac. “After this, I am not going to sit and compromise. They don’t deserve it.”

Left in the lurch

Failure to break the deadlock could tip India into a fiscal crisis: The GST would need to come into effect by mid-September, when the old system of indirect taxation is due to lapse. The lingering uncertainty is worrying companies needing to understand financial implications of the new tax.

“With so many vital details still missing, they are feeling left in the lurch,” said Saloni Roy, a senior director at Deloitte.

Modi’s shock move last month to scrap Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes was aimed at India’s shadow economy. But the ensuing cash crunch has caused job losses, disrupted supply chains and slowed construction activity.

With cash shortages showing no signs of abating, some economists are calling for emergency stimulus to cushion the economy against the impact of demonetisation.

Ambit Capital, a Mumbai brokerage, forecasts growth this fiscal year will be only half of the roughly 7% level many expect. The Reserve Bank of India has shaved its growth outlook by half a percentage point to 7.1%.

To make up for their losses, states are seeking compensation and will press their case at a meeting in New Delhi on Thursday and Friday with finance minister Arun Jaitley.

He has already agreed to cover states’ revenue losses for five years after the GST’s launch, but further concessions would narrow his room for manoeuvre in his annual budget presented in February.

One top finance ministry official dismissed demands for compensation for demonetisation as unreasonable. But states are adamant. “They have brought it upon us,” V. Narayanasamy, chief minister of Puducherry, told Reuters. “Now they must pay for our loss.”

Counting costs

The quibble is not just over lost revenue. Some states worry about the social and political costs of demonetisation.

Take Kerala, where credit cooperatives that farmers and retired government workers rely on cannot swap old bills or issue fresh notes. The state alleges this has encouraged commercial banks to scout for their deposits, sparking a “run” on them.

Odisha’s chief minister has written to Modi, saying curbs imposed on primary agriculture societies were making it difficult for farmers to access crop loans and procurement payments.

With the states smarting, they have hardened their stance on how to collect the new GST, which will have federal and state elements.

They want sole control over businesses with annual turnover of Rs15 million ($220,000) and so-called “dual control” over bigger firms. Jaitley opposes this, fearing tax collectors could end up at cross purposes.

“We reached this far because states were willing to compromise,” said Isaac, Kerala’s finance minister, told Reuters. “If they want the GST, they will have to now concede to the states.” Reuters

"[EDUCATION]How is Indian School of Business & Finance, Delhi?",38,470e0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/470e0y/educationhow_is_indian_school_of_business_finance/,138,"Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to ask on, but it relates to India, and I couldn't find a subreddit which was more appropriate. 

So my question is how good is ISBF, Delhi? Apparently, it's affiliated with University of London, with ""academic direction"" from London School of Economics. I'm not too sure about this as this is literally the first time I'm hearing about this institution (pardon my ignorance). I couldn't find much about it on other websites, either. I'm looking at a BBA (or a BSc in Business & Management in ISBF's case) from either Symbiosis, Pune or NMIMS, Mumbai. 

I have the option to go abroad, but I honestly doubt if it's worth spending 80L+ when I could get a similar degree in about 10L. Of course, the knowledge and exposure I'd get would be tremendous and I'd get a better pay as a fresher, but I doubt it's worth the extra $$$.

What do you guys feel? Thanks :D",fiftycabbages," >ISBF delhi 

Lel apne moolchand vala college. This place is small but I have heard many people go there. They sent you in your final year to London which is quite good although many other universities have this program too. 

>symbiosis pune

Get ready to smoke weed everyday. You name the type of weed you want. Like Bhasin or a little kerela gold and they got you covered. If you are planning to live in a hostel get ready to get high. Peer pressure is unbelieveable 

Tip - share munchies, jaldi dost bnege. Academics sucks there. 

>mims mumbai

Lund college hai, ek Chota sa 7th floor hai bas. No fucking campus 

And fees is retardedly high. Students ki gaand maarte hai college mein. It's a strict school. Placements are quite good here though.  NMIMS would be the way to go in my opinion.  If you can go abroad, give it a try. 

Only, beware of the fact that one year master's programme from UK won't be recognised if you return to India.  Unless you are loaded don't go abroad for undergrad. Just not worth it. Study in India and go for Master's later. What's your current age? Acha ji. Well tbh I did my college around ten years ago, things have clearly changed since then. I'll be writing the NPAT for bba too!

"Anyone working for Financial institutions and Stock Broking firms, what internet do you use?",8,2d54r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2d54r0/anyone_working_for_financial_institutions_and/,6,A friend and I are trying to setup a business which require ultra reliable internet with low latency and decent speed.(SLA of 99.5% and above is a must). Is there any leased line provider backed a SLA guarantee? I'm based in Hyderabad. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!,wildgoat," Get at least 2 lines from completely different and independent ISPs like Tata, Rcom, Airtel, Vodafone.

Most leased Internet connections come with a SLA. BUT, the SLA doesn't itself guarantee the up time. If there is a downtime, the provider will simply pay the penalties but your business will be hurt severely.

Make sure to discuss with them your needs of very high up time and get 2 different drops on one line or a backup fixed wireless link.

With two ISP which have there own backhual that takes data out of India like Tata/Rcom/Vodafone, and two lines from each you can pretty much give you 100% uptime. I am setting up a finance based business currently and am going to use airtel for leased line. They say they guarantee no downtime.

What you setting up from the look of it a sub broker or an HFT . Is it an HFT? haha, There was some add for a colocation service in front of the fort starbucks a while back. Sadly, I don't remember the name of the firm. It exists, and perhaps that will help you find it.

Also, what the heck do you plan to do? Is it whats usually within the intersect of super low latencies, finance, computing and programming?
 Get a Beam static line and a Reliance wireless one. My friend has the same requirement as you do and he too took this. ",Business/Finance,2014-08-10 20:13:51

Government is thanking tax payers. That's not enough, they have to return by pushing for more tax enforcement for tax evaders which will reduce the burden overall bringing down the tax rates. In other news, government recently proposed a bailout of 100,000 crores for bsnl / mtnl.

The fact that the finance minister mentioned everything that has happened in the country in past 5 years except demonetization is the true judgement of the government on its results! The biggest disappointment in this budget was that there is nothing in it for growth of jobs. FFS without jobs, your ""proposals"" of EVs, taxes, housing for all, etc. are of no use.

)"". 

I had earlier speculated over the radical language in the economic survey implying a clear break from the past and this symbolism increases that. Let's see if the budget follows through on all this language. That speaker's smile is creepy! The budget's fiscal deficit calculation of 3.3% for 2019-2020 (Estimated) is based on the indian economy growing by 12 % over this year ! 

&#x200B;

""GDP for BE 2019-2020 has been projected at 21100607 crore assuming 12.0 % growth over the estimated GDP of \`18840731 crore for 2018-2019 (RE)"" 

\-Footnote page 3 of [Budget at a glance](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/Budget_at_Glance/bag1.pdf)

Edit : I know its the nominal figure, but it is calculated on the basis of inflation target of 4 % which in turn depends on the success of RBI and Govt policy in reviving industrial growth in the country. 8% real growth is still a massive challenge and using an inflated figure to claim that fiscal deficit will be brought down to 3.3% of estimated gdp figure for 2019-20 still implies that the fiscal deficit will rise in rupee term.

Let me get this straight: Employer who has 400 crores of revenue gets taxed at 25%. Same employee of that employer may have to pay more than 30%.

Awesome. The budget lacked action. It had few proposals but majority of it was creating a vision for India. No big schemes or proposals So for people who want a comparison of how this budget is VS something from the MMS team, here’s chidabaram presenting the 2007 budget - http://www.moneycontrol.com/budget2007/pre_budget/Union%20Budget%202004-05.pdf?classic=true

I find that while he also says “there’s a plan for that”, he backed up more of his ideas with mechanisms of actions, cut offs to identify target groups, and specific budget allocations - at least compared to what I have seen so far by 12:10 IST. 

Let’s see how things change, and hope to be pleasantly surprised.

Edit: at least the banking section is more on the ball. However I’m not sure how RBI power over NBFCs is going to fix it?

Edit: hahaha! It’s here! Debt raising!! This is the govt of spend (not a bad thing provided it’s accretive) 


What It’s now time for our citizens duties! Is our duty to make sure we get the bang for our buck? 

Ok time for taxes.

Edit: Republican Party of India. Spend more, tax less, take on more debt, and reduce the fiscal deficit. 

Frankly, given the mess we have, even that contradictory plan is not bad. Government spending is now a major part of our teetering economy. At least that’s keeping the infra side of our economy thriving.

However someone has to pay, and with lower taxes, taking loans is the other option.

Edit: the tax credit on interest is Decent. Doesn't budget usually takes place around February, why now?

Where you need PAN, you can just use Aadhar Card. The Swaccha Bharat mission got expanded to include Solid waste treatment, can someone explain its scope? Why is the minister speaking like this is an election campaign? Is every budget like this? Economic survey showed that rajasthan which relaxed the draconian labor laws generated about 25% more jobs than other states.

The current labor laws force small scale companies to not hire more than 99 employees.

This is because, as soon as you reach 100 employees, a large number of government laws and regulations come into effect.

This has caused small companies to not have any incentive to increase in size and take advantage of scaling to reduce costs Wow their arms are going to break with all the patting their own backs.

Literally zero hard numbers so far. This is disappointing in its predictability. What time (IST) will it start? What all reforms are you expecting?

In need of urgent advice regarding career! Please help.,13,czff99,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czff99/in_need_of_urgent_advice_regarding_career_please/,4,"Hi,

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Edit - For MBA, I would love to go to the Western countries or India - wouldn't do it in Thailand. I do not mind shifting back to India if required. My family is not very well off. My parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement.",nosleepnomore," Please cross post on r/Indian_academia if you don't get any replies here. Hope it works out for you buddy. Do you have a good memory? if you have the 'cover' of a reasonably relaxed job, use the time and space to acquire skills which are valuable in the market. Then use those to change / upgrade jobs. I leave it to you to decide what skills to acquire - too hard to give specific advice on the internet without knowing you / your circumstances in person.

Look for a confluence of personal interest (in acquiring a skill) and that  skill having high market value (people will pay you money for that skill).

Good Luck. Having a business is always the ideal solution but it is also very risky, plus you need to have a good idea that works and it will take a lot of energy and effort to even get it going.

Moving to the West is almost always a good idea if you are qualified enough as they provide better opportunities, pay and lifestyle. Returning to India may not be of much financial benefit.",Business/Finance,2019-09-04 11:27:42

I find a lot of my podcasts from your first category, and my app is filled with so many podcasts that sometimes I get stressed out that i'm not able to listen to them. Also I'm not able to do multiple stuff when listening to a podcast, any suggestions on that front? SynTalk is great too.

Today we found out that he has kicked out my mother from the company and put his friend as another director. How did he do this? ( Legally what could have he done?) Is there anyway we can find out (eg  letter to ministry of corporate affairs) by which we can find out what exactly did he do.

Now that they're getting divorced, how can we know if he has put all his money in a bank account we don't know about.
Though he says that he wants to split the assets, his actions say totally otherwise. I just want to get this over with and ensure that my mom gets her fair share. She struggled a lot for the house as well as for the business but she never looked into the finances or documentation trusting my father.",throwawayhelpindia," It is not easy to fire/replace a director. If your Mother **owns 50% of the company or even 1 share of the company,** ask her **not** to sign anything without a lawyer/CA/Person You Trust Present.

To change the Director, A CA/CS needs the persons letter (easily faked) and Digital Signature (occasionally kept with CA/CS). So your father can transfer the directorship.

&#x200B;

You can right now register a complaint against the CS here: [https://smash.icsi.in/Scripts/Complaint/ComplaintForm.aspx](https://smash.icsi.in/Scripts/Complaint/ComplaintForm.aspx) and here

&#x200B;

[https://www.icsi.edu/profile/organisation-structure/discipline/](https://www.icsi.edu/profile/organisation-structure/discipline/) (send this person an email)

And if a CA, then here:

[https://www.icai.org/disciplinarydirectorate/](https://www.icai.org/disciplinarydirectorate/) .

&#x200B;

Once you send do this online, also send a simple letter via speed/registered post to the regional ICSI/ICAI office and the Headquarters in Delhi. You can Google the addresses.

&#x200B;

DO BOTH, the E-Complaint & the registered Post part.

Torn between whether to choose Canada or Australia for further studies,6,cz4498,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cz4498/torn_between_whether_to_choose_canada_or/,3,"Hello Everyone! 


I have a bachelors degree in commerce and I am now eyeing for further studies. As I have a three-year degree, Canadian universities are not accepting me and the only option I have is to enroll for those two-year diplomas. But I have heard that these two-year diploma courses are not worth it as they are simply used for getting PR. How true is that? Are there any colleges that offer some decent eduction


I aim to settle whichever country I choose so PR is important for me but I also need quality education. 


As far as Australia is concerned, it is a good option but it's very expensive so I have to take up a loan. 



I am mainly interested in business/marketing/commerce/finance/economics or maybe social work. 



So can you people suggest me what to do? (My grades are decent I do not plan on taking GMAT/GRE)",4evahungry," I would say that a bachelors degree in commerce is more in enough to get a head start in life. If you still want a masters then an MBA  from a good university like IIMS or other competitive ones can be a game-changer otherwise they will only waste your precious time. 

I would recommend doing a PG in a Metro city like Ahmedabad or Bangalore and then appear for a Bank exam which is great for settling down in India with kids. You’ll have to give GRE/GMAT to get into a ranked university, even in Canada and Australia. UofT, University of Melbourne, UBC, Waterloo, all ask for GMAT/GRE as far as I know. You’re exempt only if you have your undergraduate degree from overseas (US/UK etc.). 

Canada (Toronto) has really good opportunities for finance, being that it is very close to NYC, is emerging as a startup hub, all the big banks have offices here etc etc. Opportunities in Aus, although available, might not be as plentiful as in Toronto. 

I actually have a few cousins in Aus who are engineers and they have great careers. Anyone outside of the STEM stream isn’t faring that well.

Best of luck, OP!

Edit - I’d advise you to consider a one year Masters from a well known university in Europe to get over your 3 year degree dilemma. There are some universities offering excellent courses in Finance and Economics which will set you up for a good career or PHD and give you some much needed visa points for Canadian/Aus PR. 

Please don’t do Marketing. You can learn it on the job and it doesn’t require any technical training. Don’t waste your money on a marketing course. Similarly, social work is not very well paying. You’d find it hard to sustain if you aren’t well off already. Make sure you have your career path roughly drawn out before you make a move abroad.",Business/Finance,2019-09-03 20:20:25

I see that there is an existing master thread on the Budget. I should have ideally posted this summary there. What is PIS and FPI? \> A TV channel for startups (to be designed by startups)

Let's hope it's just not another startup news channel, 'X startup secured Y funding' is useless for 99.9% of startups.

Where as UGC type startup channel which covers knowledge rather than information i.e. 'How to identify a problem, to solve with a startup', 'How to make money with a startup', 'How to improve capital efficiency' etc. would actually be useful. What's the tax slab for hybrid vehicles going to be? Still the retarded 28+cess?

Also if this is a provision in the budget and not a rate set by the GST council, is it constitutional? If it is, then wouldn't it then become a statutory provision that the GST council cannot amend? Who will prevail? Thanku for this.",Business/Finance,2019-07-05 17:21:58

Business and boxing: two sides of the same coin,4,cqzusw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cqzusw/business_and_boxing_two_sides_of_the_same_coin/,0,"By James M. Dorsey



A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, and Patreon, Podbean and Castbox.



What do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?



Both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.



And both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.



Rather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.



A world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.



No doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.



Yet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent’s other nuclear power.



The ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.



Underscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.



The timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.



Like in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China’s brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar’s Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.



To be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.



Pakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.



Anthony Joshua’s controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.



Fact is that Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.



Nonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed’s justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.



What Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‘humane authority,’ a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.



Mr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China’s aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump’s undermining of US leadership.



Mr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.



Mr. Yan’s analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.



It is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.



To be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world’s largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.



At the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan’s theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.



Failure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.



Said Mr. Yan: “Since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.”

What is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.

Mourning the demise (?) of Jet Airways,76,beaonr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/beaonr/mourning_the_demise_of_jet_airways/,36,"I am surprised to see absence of Jet Airways closure in my r/india feed.

I flew on their BOM-AMD/BDQ leg couple of times and was very impressed by their customer service. They did a pretty good job in transferring international travellers to domestic route including luggage transfer. Also, as an international traveler, I was served hot delicious breakfast even on a 45 minutes flight, which was perhaps the best way to welcome back an NRI

Never got a chance to fly on their YYZ-BOM leg. Will always be a pipe dream.

Jet airways closure will be an interesting case for MBA finance students, and a reminder to all people - Always pay your bills on time!

PS. - The online newspaper articles doesn't explain why Jet Airways ran out of money despite doing good business. Can anyone care to elaborate?",baawri_kathputli," Bought air sahara despite warning from experts, had to write off, resulting cash shortage. Also stress sector and unstable government policies. [deleted] Read this article

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/jet-airways-timeline-when-and-what-happened-so-far-3846461.html Totally sad about jet airways leaving the scene. It was great service. It was also that one flight where tall people didn't need to pay more good leg room. The good days are gone. Miserly attitudes of India’s much famed middle class unwilling to pay for services, management issues, banks cracking down on companies run by truant owners, slowdown in the Indian economy etc. My few experiences on Jet have always been good. I hope they get operational with a new management soon. It employs a lot of people. Also the demand for air travel in India is only going to increase so Jet will leave a huge void in this sector. Yeah, it was a cheap flight and didn't feel as budget as Indigo or SpiceJet. Good service and great air hostesesseseses too. Will be missed. Yeah I've had a great time on Jet Airways as well.

I've only travelled by Jet , Indigo as of now.  
Had a much better time at Jet. On Jet, I was served free (and actually quite good) food. I got nothing on indigo. The airhostesses (guy and girl) seemed much much better on jet.  

At the airport itself, had a much better time with jet, than with Indigo. Not sure about others, or if I was in a special situation or anything, but yeah, I had a much better time on Jet than with Indigo.

(Travel experience : 1 round trip with jet, and another round trip with Indigo) Had a few memorable flights with jet.

Flew with jet when jet and air India was only premium offering...

Hated traveling by spice or go or indigo...

Always got middle seat empty on my sector.

Decently priced.

International circuit was good. Service was decent ( nothing too much, just enough)...

In a race with air india, it was indeed good.

As for other international carriers, it wasn't good. Nope. I only had one good experience in 2006 where i was served some decent meal and a fresh towel to wipe my face.

After the luxury of Kingfisher in it's heyday, jet always seemed over hyped and overpriced. 

Flew on their international flights last year, and it felt like i was flying Air India. Rubbish food, sparing cabin service and visibly aging aircraft. Bad situation for the employees very average airline in terms of flying experience. I didn't see the point of paying extra compared to indigo/spicejet for the almost same service. I had a jet airways flight in the morning, now I have no idea if/when I will get my money back. What are my options? I booked it through PayTM. 

What's worse is that I HAD to be where I needed to be and ended up booking a much more expensive flight. Fucking sucks. Talking about YYZ-BOM sector, looks like I am down $4000 because Jet shut down.

Today has been an absolutely awful day because of that. :(

Edit: I had booked 3 family members on AMD-BOM-YYZ return trips and I don't think I'll ever see that money. I was even thinking getting business class for one of the tickets (my grandmother). That would've been another $2000 down lol. At least I have that going for me, which is nice 3 months ago I flew jet airways from Paris chennai and back to Paris. Worst flight, service experience for an international flight. At that time itself I complained to their customer service. Sorry to say this.  I’m glad they’re out of business. I’ve flown many international airlines and this was the worst of it all. Lost all my JP miles :(",Business/Finance,2019-04-18 01:39:57

Edit: Custom duty hike in many electronic items. This can affect your purchase decisions.  Mi phones may become cheaper than OnePlus :-)

[ref1](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dhfl-falls-3-on-reports-of-mha-issuing-lookout-notice-against-promoters-4030801.html) , [ref2](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/lookout-notice-against-dhfl-promoters-over-non-existent-shell-companies/articleshow/69534981.cms)

also, DHFL's stock price has been going down steep the past year.   

&nbsp;  

1. what exactly is the problem at DHFL?  
1. are they seeing poor loan repayments by home loan borrowers?  
1. is this the canary-in-coalmine   situation for a wider home-loan / real estate crash in India ?  
1. what causes led to this situation?   
1. did DHFL lend too aggressively / to 'sub prime' borrowers?  
1. what other lenders did similar practices , and are likely to face similar situation?  
1. is there any link between ILFS situation and DHFL ?  
1. if DHFL crashes (like ~~NSDL~~ NSEL, Giranjali gems, Kingfisher, etc) what would be the wider consequences? would their retail home-loan borrowers still need to continue paying EMIs after the lender company is liquidated / closed? (kek)    
1. from whom has DHFL borrowed money? what would be that lender's impact?  
1. are real-estate builders impacted in any manner due to this?  
* would this be yet another case of ""socialise the losses"" and hence some govt company (LIC esp) rescuing DHFL ?",donoteatthatfrog," There are multiple factors involved.

Firstly NBFCs model is flawed. They borrow short term say 6 months to a year and lend Long term say 3-5 years.
Because of this they have to constantly keep raising funds.

Dhfl crisis happened because of poor liquidity on Dhfl part as they have some 20% exposure in bad performing real estate firms. But the Main cause of crisis is because of IL&FS. They had mismanagement of funds by senior managers of their subsidiaries because of which they defaulted on emis and the crisis began.

Now Dhfl wanted to raise funds because their short term borrowings were maturing but mutual funds as well as share market was pulling money from nbfcs as they deemed it too risky because of IL&FS. Because of this Dhfl was forced to borrow funds at very high interest.

This is the jist of it there is more to this. I recommend watching finnovationz video on this topic. NSDL crashed before? Then there is that Cobrapost expose as well. Something is shady at DHFL.",Business/Finance,2019-05-29 12:58:13

■ **Ornit Shahni, [How India Became Democratic](https://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/how-india-became-democratic/) (Penguin, 2018)**

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Banerjee's book is an ethnographic study that attempts to answer the question of why Indians exercise their right to vote. Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

The Verdict: Decoding India's Elections

> What are the key factors that win or lose elections in India? What does, or does not, make India's democracy tick? Is this the end of anti-incumbency? Are opinion polls and exit polls reliable? How pervasive is the 'fear factor'? Does the Indian woman's vote matter? Does the selection of candidates impact results? Are elections becoming more democratic or less so? Can electronic voting machines (EVMs) be fiddled with? Can Indian
> elections be called 'a jugaad system'? 
> Published on the eve of India's next general elections, The Verdict uses rigorous psephology, original research and as-yet-undisclosed facts to talk about the entire span of India's electoral history from the first elections in 1952. Crucially, for 2019, it provides pointers to look out for, to see if the incumbent government will win or lose.

https://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/the-verdict/ Thank you for making the list, OP.  A forthcoming book that looks interesting as well is Ruchir Sharma's Democracy on the Road (Penguin) but I haven't read that as yet.  Thanks for the list OP. There's also a new podcast by Milan Vaishnav called [Grand Tamasha](https://carnegieendowment.org/grandtamasha/) . It is a co-prod with HT and Darnegie Endowment for Peace. I recommend The Verdict. Also off topic, but can someone recommend a book that summarises the Constituent Assembly Debates about what went into making the constitution? mandatory mention of India After Gandhi, which covers the first election (and some important subsequent elections) I'd add Ruchir Sharma's **Democracy on the Road: A 25 Year Journey through India** to this list. 

From the 1990s to December 2018, he and journalist/analyst friends of his basically take road trips to most Indian states to see state and general election campaigns. It cites many of the academics listed in this thread, but it's a book for everyone and each chapter covers a different election. Quite funny/eye-opening/shocking at various points, as  they talk to everyone from Maoists to RSS to swing voters. They also talk to basically every major politician of the last 2 decades while on the campaign trail.",Business/Finance,2019-04-05 17:43:24

Please help me with career advice,18,ahuc0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ahuc0c/please_help_me_with_career_advice/,13,"I am a 24 year old male with BBA in Finance. I studied in Thailand. My family lives in Thailand. We have a diamond trading business. I worked with my dad for a year before finding a job in a jewelry factory. I have been working in this factory for little over a year now.

I am being paid 55k baht a month. The problem is, there isn't much growth in this industry. I feel the industry is shrinking. I am hoping to get out by this year. Another problem is, it is very difficult to get a job as a foreigner in Thailand. 

What skills can I develop on the side so I can switch industries? I am thinking programming. But I have no prior knowledge. I do not mind coming back to India for work.

Is MBA a good option? What other ways can I make money on the side?

I have around 10 lac rupees saved.",nosleepnomore," You are making decent money and India doesn't really have the jobs or growth it used to.

Diamond trade globally is dominated by Gujju's, why not go up the supply chain and apply for management positions at customer facing companies. 

You don't seem very enthusiastic about your current line of work. You definitely need to work for a few more years to get some clarity on the general direction you want to take.

MBA is an expensive decision and should be taken with much more thought and is not a guarantee to reduce or remove your current confusion.

You have an advantage of being in a more developed country surrounded by fast growing economies along with India as a back-up. You already have some professional assets/experiences in place. Use that to discover more and learn and spend your life savings on a degree when you are sure about what you want.  So you're talking about career shift and rapid growth. with a managerial experience and international exposure, an international mba from top 20 would be a good bet. If you want to study in India, ISB is one such option. Do you hold a Thai passport? If yes, look into getting into the IIMs via the foreign student route. Much easier to get in than through the regular CAT Tell me which Indian dude gets paid 15L per annum like you are, at the age of 24? Guys with your qualification in india earn 1/5th of what you earn. Since you’ve saved 10L until now, which is a great amount of money for your age, you can do an MBA and a PGDM from a **top ranked university** under NRI quota for that amount. You’ll need a good number of years put aside for that, and then you’ll get jobs that pay above 10LPA in the beginning. After that, the sky’s the limit. I think you already earn well enough, and really don’t need to come to india which has its own problems of having way too much of competition for a job. The Thailand govt cares about their country more than India does and I think you’ll earn really well staying there instead of coming to India. Lady boi ban ja. ",Business/Finance,2019-01-20 12:45:34
Broke up 30! What next???,14,al2pdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/al2pdh/broke_up_30_what_next/,12,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;",ablahnaari," Chill dude, no need to worry. It's better to be alone than with someone with whom you're not comfortable. Living by yourself has its own advantage.  * You have time. 30 is not that old. Get back out there when you are ready.
* Don't blame yourself, or your ex. If you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices, either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise. 
* If it had to end, Its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later.
* Give it some time and re-evaluate, feelings always clouds reality. Everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens. Time heals most wounds if you let it.
* Stay Positive. I am 33 years old, have never been in a relationship, no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons, yet I keep faith while also keeping fit, enjoying my life, finding new interests and try to travel as much as I can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and ""society"". Last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards. Love has no sell by date.
* You mentioned you love to travel, do more of it, its a great distraction. Plan a trip in the near future. Travel has healing and transformative powers.

I wish you all the best!
  The dude lived in the city for 20+ years and wants to go farm? Let him. He seems passionate about it, don’t hold him back.

As for you, you are too young to be worried about what’s gonna happen to you. Take it easy and move on; you have no idea what’s in store. 

That ablanaari shit was funny though 😊 >I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head

Stop worrying about that crap and work on making yourself a better person. Pickup some new hobbies. Hang out with your friends or try making new ones. I have to admit that I have not travelled as much as you did.

But my only suggestion right now is to pack your bag and leave your home.
 You will get a  better solution as I am pretty sure you will meet up someone who has solutions to all your problems. 

LPT: Just talk to as many people as possible. find new things to do. the less you sit and ponder, the better it'll be. give it time, and then ponder, and let go.

live life forward, not backwards. You took the right longterm decision. The blaming, bitterness and sadness for a few months is common. Convince and coax your mind that you took a good positive long-term decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned. 

*Express* your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way. For me, writing them in detail in a diary worked. But if you're not into writing, record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself. 

Or if you have a close friend who's a good listener, express it in front of them. I don't know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps, but it does.

As for fear of society, most people don't bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled. Solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite a bit. I'd suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons - such as love and companionship - and never for negative or shallow reasons - such as fear / reputation / social status.  take it from a 24 y/o guy, who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love.

&#x200B;

Smoke a joint, let go off things, and start afresh. 30 ain't too old. You still have a good 4-5 years before you settle down. Goodluck and learn to forgive but not forget :) 30+something, just broke up. Its very normal to hate your ex even if he/she hasnt done anything horrible. 

&#x200B;

Be kind to yourself. Im not a believer in god or spirituality but mindfulness has helped me. What are you going through is grief. Its the same feeling as you would feel if a loved one died. You probably already know the 5 stages of grief. You are going to go through all of it, not in sequence but in circles. Give yourself time and be kind to yourself. 

&#x200B;

Trust me I went through this, Im not out yet .. but I am a million times better than what I was immediately after.  curious question... is the word 'abla' or 'ablah'? i know certain indian demographic ppl like to add 'h' around their 'T's but cmon why here? i am pretty sure the actual word is abla

I want to learn to programme and investing in the little free time I have. Programming so that I can switch jobs in two years or at the least freelance (Note: I have zero knowledge about programming). Also, after reading several articles, they mention programming is one of the jobs that is to stay even when robots become prevalent. 

My second option is to start an online business. I do not know what the business will be as I really haven't thought about it.

What would you do if you were in my position? Develop skills or start a side hustle? 

I make 50K a month and the expenses are growing exponentially. ",nosleepnomore," Bhai 8am-8pm is not a day job, it's slavery.

Aur programme ki jagah program karna seekhna.

Waise freelancers ki koi aukaat nahi hai, and i can prove that. Freelancer.com pe jaake koi bhi project daalna, india se freelancers toot padenge. I’ll just add some information to help you make your decision:
Entry level job in Infosys pays ~25k per month. But during their training period there is virtually no expenditure. 
 If you are going to learn programming for job security (and considering robots a threat, no less), without having any knowledge about it, I'd say try something else you already know. Programming can be fun but your motivations are not in line with what makes it fun. Absolutely, try it. But don't expect to earn decently in a matter of a couple of years.

Similarly, ""an online business"" is too vague. If you have some particular thing in mind, we can probably give you a fair idea if we'll buy it or not. 

If I were in your position, I'd try programming for a couple of months and look at what I can possibly sell online and if I can find business partners. I'll tell my experiences here and *then* ask how I should proceed.
 You can land yourself a high paying programming job provided you have good credentials like hackerearth rank / GSoC rank / github profile. I have seen a unemployed non-IT BSc Chemistry 27 year old guy do it by self learning coding. Good luck !! Working in jewellery factory means what? Are you a Craftsman? Learn to communicate clearly what you have experience doing otherwise people without understanding your background might give misleading advice?

If you do have some years of training and skill with your hands in making jewellery then it's not a bright idea to switch to programming. Unless you don't like your job, keep improving your skill. A skilled person plus a machine will always beat a skilled person alone or a machine alone. 

The problem with robots (like your cell phone), every two years maintaining them and updating software and changing their hardware designs (because what customers want change constantly and hardware improves constantly) is very very expensive. So having skilled people operating machines is always going to be the better choice.

Jewellery sector in India is quite big and growing esp exports. The amounts people are spending on top quality jewellery has hugely increased. 
One option maybe is to try to move to better companies/bigger brand names/export oriented companies etc and gain experience.  Typical Indian mentality : get on the IT wagon == one true and absolute certain way of survival.

So sad. the real question is why would IT companies hire you as a software dev?

there are too many of us already, and for you to catchup its going to be extremely hard. even if you somehow become good enough, 6lpa will not be what they would be paying.

Not saying it can't be done, but you should know that to make big money at big N companies, you really have to become great coder. Which is something I have been struggling with.",Business/Finance,2019-01-02 14:40:50
"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman",6,azoh6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azoh6g/suddenly_one_nation_one_policy_sentiment_is/,3,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

[The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/yv-reddy-interview/article26489119.ece)",Avinash_Sharma, I've always liked the forest cover model of assigning tax resources to the States. It's a very esteemable initiative. [deleted] Summary ,Business/Finance,2019-03-11 11:39:27

M21, Delhi

&#x200B;

I've invented a stationary utility device and now want to turn it in a business. I've applied for design, patent,trademarks as Intellectual properties. I have completed msme and gst registration. i've prepared visiting cards, proprietor stamp, installed billing software and a 100 pgs letterpad. I have a batch of 400 pcs ready to test the market .  I won't disclose it before the launch so please don't ask about it (no offence).

Not bragging just giving the information, I've done everything alone from research to paperwork to purchase raw material to manufacturing( plastic parts come from factory. i have to assemble it and pack in the box) to finance/money stuff (ca does gst returns). It has really taken a toll on me.

&#x200B;

here's my work environment.

i want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

&#x200B;

i really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

anything else you want to advice me you're welcome guys. I'm just a 21 year old trying to escape from the rat race and want to really contribute something to the world.

&#x200B;

\[EDIT\]   do i need to register  or do anything under shop and establishment act? 

&#x200B;

do i need a manufacturers licence ?",cooltechpec," >my queries are

>can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator. and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.

Yes, you can. no permision or licences are required.

>do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

No you do not. Unless you are running a factory consuming alot of electricity. Get your shop later once you make a profit.

>do i need to pay rent to parents.

Up to you, if you feel your parents deserve the revenue for allowing you to conduct business from their home. (personal relations)

>can i cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

NO, this is your business. so it will not affect his job

>do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

NO

>do i need current account.

It is advisable to get it as you can separate your personal expense from the business expense, so get it. Most current accounts allow a minimum balance of only 10k 

If you are looking for markets to showcase your product, PM me.  You're overthinking this OP. Forget about permissions and licenses and everything else. 

Get sales first. Everything comes after that. 

Just make sure to not make your dad a director in the company (pvt ltd). Government employees can't be directors in private companies Good luck mate!
 I am very curious about your product and I hope you will post an update about it once you launch it. All the best. You need to give more information. 

What is the per piece sale price, and what is the size of the product? 

Who are your customers? How do you plan to sell the product and in what quantity.

The answers to these may change the answers to your questions. Can't you rent a shop for few months for your trial phase? 

Since your dad is a government employee, is the housing accommodation provided by his employee? If he is a government employee, then someone out there can create a fuss if they want to. That's the nature of it, and legality or the illegality of it comes later.

But again, you are at the moment not making any money. So it's okay to launch from your house. But as soon as you start making money, talk to a lawyer to see if your business needs special permits that can make your operations illegal. For instance, since the house is in your dad's name, he could be accused of moonlighting on a commercial venture. 

If you cannot find a leased space, you could also talk to your university or universities in the vicinity. Many of them have entrepreneurship cells and they could help you out with something (leasing out space, etc.)
 Bhai best of luck I wish you all the best. I can't answer your question as I am a salaried professional..

But I'd like an update once things start rolling for you.

Keep us updated.

Cheers!  [deleted] how useful is your inventions, what scale do you think you can see your invention is going to be used/sold/made.

+ Germany upto 47.475%
+ Sweden upto 60%
  
Take any country that has public healthcare and you'll see tax rates that will make you cry blood.

Now one percent increase in cess might not seem like a lot. Look at how this will affect you in the long term.
  
More over majority of the health ailments are because of life choices and are self inflicted ailments.

+ Fucking drunk people destroying their livers.
+ Something about tobacco users and smokers getting cancer...
+ People eating shitty food and getting sugar and cholesterol... (Heart ailments)
+ Some idiots being irresponsible and having abortion... or having 6 kids for that matter...
etc.
  
Who the fuck pays for BJP's pet project???
  
+ The tax payers who already pay fuck load of taxes on their income and whatever they buy (GST)...
+ People who pay more taxes than their rent.
+ People who don't own cars...
  
Public healthcare is the worst idea ever.

Well take it in the ass and cough up the taxes or get ready to go to jail for not paying taxes.

3.	Salaried tax payers – No changes in structure. Salaried taxpayer – standard deduction of Rs. 40,000/- in lieu of transport and reimbursement of medical expenses. 

4.	Senior citizens – exemption of interest income from FD / RD increased to Rs. 50,000. No TDS u/s 194A for this. Health insurance deduction from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 50,000. 

5.	Rs. 1,00,000/- deduction u/s 80DDB for critical illnesses for senior and very senior citizens

6.	Payment exceeding Rs. 10,000 in cash disallowed for Trusts. Non-deduction of TDS would be disallowed @ 30%

8.	Increase cess by 1%. Total cess @ 4% health and education cess

9.	E assessment – to be expanded 10% LTCG on equity returns is with or without indexation? Are we just going to ignore the FCRA amendments again? 

> 
> The government has for the second time introduced amendment to the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) in the finance Bill, paving the way for both the BJP and Congress to escape legal scrutiny for receiving foreign contribution since 1976, the year FCRA regulations were introduced.

http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/fcra-amendment-in-finance-bill-to-help-bjp-congress-escape-scrutiny-5049589/ Remember, in UPA's government's first term last budget, they gave debt forgiveness to farmers at a national level to win elections. The fact that NDA has not given into anything like that itself is a positive.

Budget overall is ok. More exemption for salaried class is good, LTCG is a non-issue with grandfathered gains. LTCG is there in many countries, markets will factor that in. The only change should have been LTCG at 2-3 years not 1 year.

Increase in cess sucks. Do away with all these cess and rationalize tax brackets and bring more people into the tax net. Tax farmer incomes for fuck's sake. Chud Gaye phir se salaried log Your worst fear is here!

LTCG: Gains exceeding 1 lakh to be taxed at 10% without indexing Salaries of MPs, President and Governor increased! http://www.indiabudget.gov.in/ub2018-19/eb/allsbe.pdf

No allocation for the much hyped health insurance announced today. It is just the meagre same allocation for the existing UPA health insurance.  IIT Madras will work on 5g and block chain  Direct Tax growth 2017\-18 : 12.6&#37;  Nothing but Schadenfreude when seeing actual rich people claiming that they are middle-class and whining that no government does anything for them.  Gobartatti budget for the salaried middle class.  If not for the huge spending on infra,  this was like any vanilla UPA budget.  Anyone with a taxable salary more than 10 lakhs is basically fucked.

4% cess for income tax payers along with no change in the slabs? Wow. Also 10% tax on Long Term Capital Gains and reduced corporate tax for companies making upto Rs. 250 crores (25%). Corporations need all the deductions it seems. 

If the income tax base rose to 8 crores, could you not give some relief to them by lowering taxes? Would have gotten better tax revenues with a wider base anyway.

Again, the Government sees the middle class as the silent pony to beat around with a stick.

Can someone explain this? Thank you! Does new tax on LTCG imply that people will now try to ensure that they have atleast 1 Lakh LTCG / year, in order to claim max tax benefit? Rural Gujarat gave BJP the shaft while urban stayed with them, so now the govt takes the urban for granted and making attempts to please the rural.  Good Initiative for Senior Citizens!

http://www.financeminutes.com/budget-2018-for-senior-citizens-key-benefits-relief/ I work in fund management and welcome long term capital gains. Allowing people to ride secular bull runs without paying tax promotes inequality. Risk inequities is way overstates especially if you don't sell.

Well, disappointed, but is it enough to vote for Congress in next elections? Aur gaand maar lo bhen chod. Cess increased by 1%. There is so much ignorance in this thread.

Okay first, the cess is already 3% now ... It's been 2-3% since more than 10 years ! And the cess is calculated on the tax you have to pay and not your income. NO, THE MIDDLE CLASS DOES NOT GET FUCKED BY 1% CESS ON TAX.

Second, LTCG. Let's do the math. If you're to earn 1 lakh a year as capital gains and let's say you've earned 10% return in the year, that just means you have had 10lakhs to invest in stock market.

Someone who has 10lakhs to invest in stock market IS NOT MIDDLE CLASS. Middle class in this country is worse off than Cows of this country. Atleast they have Gau-rakshaks to protect their ass After everything is announced and available can someone breakdown the budget and explain everything in layman terms?

This is some big shit. kudos 1 Class Mild aur 1 Rajni Gandha total 32 Rs ka milta tha, ab kitne ka padega ? Thanks for doing this :) [deleted] Standard deduction a beneficial for employees not getting many allowances basically lower middle class or middle class.

http://www.financeminutes.com/standard-deduction-back-budget-2018-relief-to-salaried-employees/ I know this will get downvoted soon, but someone needs to put this out.
A lot of people are saying/posting here how bad it is for salaried people. I posted this somewhere else a while back, and so posting again:

**Less taxes on salaries does not necessarily mean your take home salary will increase. Companies will just pay you lower (look long term not short term). Taxes on salaries are not taxes on individuals but taxes on employers.**

Please. People need to understand it. Less taxes on salaries will just give you more money in the short term. In the long term no difference.

Edit: But seriously, **if you are gonna downvote me, provide with a rebuttal. If you can't, you are contributing to spread of lies/false-information, pretty much like online trolls.** Just that this time you are at the receiving end.

Edit2: Some people think removing all taxes from salaried class people (like done for farmers) won't increase inflation. Salaried class people paid a total of Rs 1.44 lakh crore as taxes (source: http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2018-19/news/budget-2018-standard-deduction-of-rs-40000-on-income-tax-actually-amounts-to-just-rs-10000-benefit/story/269379.html). That much more money and inflation won't increase. Good luck with that.

Edit3: I will delete this post within 24 hours. No point arguing when no one is ready to listen. :)

Edit4: Had I just worded this differently, ""Higher taxes doesn't mean less take home. Companies will be forced to increase salaries."" no one would have complained. :P

Edit5: A similar thing happened during demonitization. All salary-class people hailed Modi as God, Modi finally took the long-standing revenge of the salary-class against all shop-keepers, farmers, business owners. Masterstroke by Modi.
When I tried debating, most salary-classed were like: ""Why should I care, I pay all taxes, all my money is in banks, why should only salary-class pay all taxes?"". Now when the demonitization induced slowdown is gripping the entire country slowly, that is when they realize how brutally naive their arguments were.

Edit6: Ravish Kumar also said the middle class should not crib about the budget when there other much more important things to worry about. Here: https://youtu.be/B8dM1MGxQFw?t=16m53s Meanwhile, Congress is leading in all 3 LS seats in Rajasthan.  What is this long term capital gains tax? Is it a part of income tax or its a separate tax which I have to pay even without having any income? Could somebody ELI5 as to why middle class or salaried citizens are fucked? What were the expectations of which were not met regarding them? More tax on salaried class. Education/health cess goes up by 1 % to 4 % Thread deleted?

Harish Damodaran is a brilliant analyst, so keep an eye on him. Income tax batao yar. Bore ho gaye. The National Health Protection Scheme is more ""Obamacare"" and less NHS. Like earlier governments, this govt has also placed the onus on the private sector. 
 Right now I have a deduction of 60k for vehicles, and 15k for medical. So I'll be paying MORE taxes with the 40k standard deduction The healthcare coverage he talked about sounds splendid - up to 5 lakh rupees per annum for everyone. I wonder how it will get so much funding though. Anand Mahindra Applause!

FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: “I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act”. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire — learning to unlearn yesterday’s wisdom.

FEDERAL DEMOCRACY


1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.

 >Why has the government backed away from the EV policy? 

They haven't. There is still a large subsidy for EV's and where I live, public charging infrastructure is being tested privately on a large scale.  It's going to take time to come to all cities. But they haven't backed down at all. 

Source: I am in the EV Vehicle industry. I'm listening to him talk about job creation right now. It's literally the dumbest shit I've ever heard. He's fucking assuming that people are creating jobs for other people.

Example 1: X number of students graduated from law school. If we assume that each of them started their own practice and employed 2 people then, Y number of jobs have been created. WTF?  BECAUSE CONGRESS...NEHRU...60 YEARS...EMERGENCY...HINDU IS IN DANGER!

Also how come demonetisation led to loss of so many jobs?

Also isnt the problems with money deposits in swiss bank is that there is no way to force swiss banks to disclose details without seriously damaging diplomatic ties? Modi's reply - Bhak saala. Bjp govt is illegally controlling Admk and TN govt. This must stop.

Kiran bedi must mind her own business in puducherry.

Mining and frackong projects of ambani and adani fraudsters must stop in TN.  Wrote NP by mistake. Fixed the flair.  Fuck him. He said 1 crore jobs were made,by some ""independent survey"" and disregarded the government figures  Kek. This is so uninformed, it is hilarious!

> 5) Rafale Deal: Is there a secret pact between France & India to not reveal the cost of defence equipment being bought?

No, the pact is in the public domain. Further, the aggregate price can be revealed, and has been. In Parliament. The details cannot. 

> Why was contract taken away from HAL and given to a businessman?

Was it? Proof?

> 6) Doklam: Why was issue not raised during PM’s China summit (April 2018)?

It wasn't? Proof? If it wasn't, why did the statement mention ""peace and tranquility in all areas of the India-China border region""? u/kumbhakaran is an avid Parliament watcher.

He's be pleased to see this exhaustive list.

But all these count for zilch unless your MP raises them in Parliament and gets the govt to answer.

Can you write to your MP? Why does the goberment of Chindia tolerate weapons training camps of Bajrang Dal and RSS? This is waaaay too long to read in whole, but a couple of things I noticed near the top, a few questions I too want the answer to:

> 5) ... Why was contract taken away from HAL and given to a businessman?

Why should HAL get the contract by default? In fact, why should HAL exist in the first place? Why should any PSU exist? It is not the govt's job run the industry or banking or whatever. Rather, focus on privatizing the PSUs.

> 10) Why MSP not raised to 1.5 times of C2, as recommended by Swaminathan committee? (TMC MP)

Thank our lucky stars it wasn't! Why should MSP be raised? What evidence is there that increasing MSP benefits farmers? Why should there be a subsidy in farming in the first place? The focus should be on industrialization and creating blue collar jobs so that people don't have to be engaged in farming in the first place.
 There is this tiny question but carries a lot of weight. Who is the FM? Wtf is happening with the cabinet? Jaitley, Parrikar go off duty while being elected and stay invisible for months and some Tom Dick & Harry is a finance expert overnight? How is this okay? TL;DR. Where the fuck are my 15 lakhs! Fuck you.  -Why is the first planned Smart city - Dholera, Gujarat incomplete?

-Why isn't the government punishing the corrupt politicians from the opposition?

-Why is the unrest in Kashmir at an alltime high?

-What are the steps taken to address the stagnant prices of the real estate market and the politican-builder-banking mafia nexus?

-Why is the common man being penalized/taxed unfairly to compensate the bankrupt businessmen?

-Why are bad loans being waived off without much transparency in the process?

-What are the reasons for diplomatic failure in handling the Maldives crisis?

-Why is the energy policy still revolving around coal imports and the transition towards renewable energy slow?

-Former Railway minister said that 15 lakhs would be deposited in every Indians account once blackmoney is

"With the recent Oxfam India Inequality report & Congress' Minimum Income Guarantee announcement, why aren't we discussing AOC's 70% marginal tax in India already?",3,alx3kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/alx3kj/with_the_recent_oxfam_india_inequality_report/,4,"[Oxfam Report](https://scroll.in/latest/910224/oxfam-inequality-report-indias-richest-1-grew-by-39-in-2018-bottom-half-by-3)

[Minimum Income Guarantee](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/congress-beats-bjp-to-income-guarantee-plan-but-leaves-math-to-manifesto)

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",sultanatehere," Ohh pls...

GOI will need a separate department of International taxation to tax all the millionaires who accepted foreign citizenships... Idk why you talk of dividend income as if it's untaxed. Dividends are given after tax. Then there is also dividend distribution tax and some cess on it.  We badly need an inheritance tax as well to address the wealth inequalities.",Business/Finance,2019-02-01 10:13:23
"So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.",27,9ypjsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9ypjsr/so_you_made_yourself_a_little_bit_of_money_huh/,11,"# So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.
&nbsp;

All your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.

And now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

",DexterMilburn," Is this a copy-pasta or did you actually spend time making up this...whatever this is Here's the TL;DR for people who just want the important stuff, without the bells and whistles that I have to attach just to keep your short attention span:

* If you're thinking about investing, take a moment to realize that, strictly in the financial sense, you're doing better than most people in the country.
* Be aware of the people who will try to stick you with expensive and bad investments. Not everyone is out to look for your best interests.
* Make sure you're bringing in more money than you're spending. Without any money left over at the end of the month, you've got bigger fish to fry. Mmhhmm, tasty fish.
* Make sure you've got all your loans and debts under control. After your monthly EMIs, think about setting a little more money aside to prepay. Loans with higher interest rates, like credit card loans, take priority. Borrowing money isn't bad, but not having a plan to repay definitely is.
* Pick up a book every once in a while. Start reading any book that picks your curiosity and gradually move towards more topical books on personal finance. It's good for your health.
* Don't invest in gold, or any other commodity. You've got better options than that. As an investment, gold does nothing but sit there and look at you. The exit plan is just hoping that someone will pay higher than what you paid.
* Don't mix insurance and investing. They are two different services, why would you want to mix them? By separating the two, you're making your financial life simpler and easier. 
* Only buy a house if you're going to live in the said house. Property as an investment is not liquid, aces high transaction costs, requires government approvals, faces high maintenance costs and exists without any transparency.
* Identifying bad investments is a greater skill than identifying good investments. Gold and real estate are bad investments. Stocks and bonds are good investments. Mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds allow you to benefit from them.
* Have patience. All investing is for the long term. The stock market will move up and it will move down. Some days, it won't move at all. None of this should matter to you, because all you care about is the fact that over periods longer than 10 years, the stock market has always created a great amount of wealth.
* Don't watch any televised business news channel. They give you the news of the day. You're not worried about the day. You care about the year and the decade. For news, read newspapers like Livemint and Reuters India.
* Here's a basic plan: when you get paid, make sure you pay all required EMIs on your outstanding loans. With what is left, estimate your expenses for the month. This estimate will get better with time. Take out the money etstimated, and invest the rest. Begin with having three months of expenses in a liquid fund as an emergency fund. After than, pick 3-8 mutual funds depending on your risk appetite and time horizon. Refer table above for more information. Set up SIPs so that you can force some financial discipline on yourself. Review the plan annually.
* This basic plan will require tweaking based on the context of your life. But having that plan is important.
* Investing is not rocket science. Assuming you're individual of average intelligence and awareness, even you can do it with quite satisfactory results. Beware of people who will try to convince you that investing is like open heart surgery.

&#x200B; Really well written and a fun read. Thanks for the write up. This should be a sticky at /r/indiainvestments     * Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks. Please read the offer documents carefully before investing. I used to enjoy your Last week in economy series OP. Keep up the good work. Any plans to bring it back? Huge fan here.  Great write up, OP.

&#x200B;

I come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.

&#x200B;

Now he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.

&#x200B;

I forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated.",random_throwaway1579," Glad your family situation is better.  Can you call the college office during working hours and see if they are willing to look into this? 

Any degree is good. B. Com should be good if you plan a business in future or pursue further studies like MBA/CA.  Bhai get back your career on track.
The best thing you could do to support your family. How old are you now ?

What do you do for a living ?


 First, go to Mumbai right away to collect your documents from the college!

Second, take it as a fresh start. If you are not sure of B.Com, think of some other option. If you are concerned about the time wasted, you could perhaps enroll for a correspondence program from IGNOU until the next academic year? Dude, from your replies, I notice you're 20. So, first off you have time on your side - LOADS of it! That's a good thing.

Now coming to your conundrum, I understand you may be anxious to share it with some admin guy in your college.  However, if it helps you re-secure your place in the college, I'd say it's worth it. However, you have to be prepared for the worst case scenario that they may not take you back. So you gotta keep your options open.

Finally, yes [B.Com](https://B.Com). is worth it. However, IF you can do, I'd suggest doing something in Economics. If you do well in Economics, there usually are good opportunities, including scholarships for Masters. Just by 2 cents. Happy to discuss if you have any further questions.

As valuator I have been holding approved licence from other competent authority of India too.

I am Diploma Automobile, post diploma in sales management, B Tech (Mech), MBA Finance, Fellow IIISLA, Alternate dispute resolution and other professional qualifications also. I have my own proprietorship company and having office in prime location of Ahmedabad city of India. As a surveyor we get the allotment of work from insurers. As valuator we generally get the valuation work from banking sector, NBFC etc for refinance purpose of assets like cars, commercial vehicles, Engineering equipment, plant & machineries, earth movers, mining equipment etc.   

Looking to the current scenario of India-Ahmedabad. it seems that the some of the issues like inflation, population, traffic, pollution, reservation, parking issues etc are never going to be solved. They are being increased day by day. India has become of 130 cr. Mentality of certain class people are on too below level and we feel that it is never going to be changed. Business scenario is also being deteriorated due drastic and impractical changes in government policy. Political leaders are minting their own except few. As per international media India is growing but as per my experience picture of actual India is different.

For last 3 years l have been getting job offer from Canada. In 2016 from Alberta and in 2017 from British Columbia etc. I was not sincere about these offers. Taking in a view the worth uses of qualifications, experience and Looking further for better future of my sons I think sincerely this time. The offer is from St john- New Brunswick.

New Bruns wick is an Atlantic province out of total 4 provinces. St john have population of 7.50 lacs approximately. The population have been deviated in last 4 years due to some unknown reasons. I have been offered 60,00 Canadian Dollar per annum from General Insurance company of St John- New Brunswick Canada.  I will be deputed at St John only. I assume that the offer is via authentic consultant of Canada. It is to be noted that nothing is written as off now. I will have to sign the bond for 2 years for the job of said company.  As per my knowledge job profile in st john is same as India. 

The role will be as collision surveyor that is my core competence.   
I have following queries:

01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer???


02. Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.


03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence.  Are these the information appropriate???


04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??


05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.


07. Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??


08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??


09. My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?  

10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???


11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??


12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?


13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

Please share any other information which are useful.",chaxulpandya," > 01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer??? 

depends on what kind of life you are aiming for. there are trade-offs involved when you immigrate, so you need to look at the big picture. it's not just a financial decision, but one that involves your family, future generations, cultural changes, weather/climate changes, etc.

&#x200B;

> 03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate??? 

Please go through the NB PNP website in great detail. Read through the entire website and the application guide, etc. Do not just trust what the consultant is telling you. The canadian immigration process is quite transparent- the process is well outlined so everything you need to know will be on their website, including forms, documents required, fees, etc. Also, from the website, it seems that NB is not accepting applications for PNP currently.

&#x200B;

> 04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

again, go through the NB PNP website. you'll find all the information there

&#x200B;

> 05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed??? 

I'd suggest you pose this question in a canada immigration or legal community. In my opinion, such bonds are not enforceable in Canada, but i'm not a 100% sure

&#x200B;

> 06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer. 

Cleaner air, less crime, better work life balance, higher respect for life, effective government/ public administration systems, tax dollars that actually work and benefit residents

&#x200B;

> 08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security?? 

not sure what this certificate is but again, please go through the NB PNP site in detail. that will tell you what you need and do not need

&#x200B;

> 10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.??? 

most big cities in the maritimes have indian stores and restaurants. you will be able to find most spices and ingredients, but you probably won't be able to replicate your culinary preferences a 100%

&#x200B;

> 11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier?? 

Please search ""canada express entry"" in google. that seems to be a popular PR channel these days

&#x200B;

> 13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources. 

There are a number of options, so depends on what you're looking for. Also, i doubt if any city in canada has ""pleasant"" weather. Vancouver is probably the only city that has a slightly bearable winter.

&#x200B;

To summarize, i would say to read the NB PNP website and express entry website in detail. as i mentioned, do not just trust what the consultant is saying. do your own due diligence.

&#x200B; Kem chho Pandya kaka... I will try to answer your concerns. My background: I was 15 when my father immigrated to Canada from Vadodara.

Here are my responses:

> Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.

$60,000 should give you savings (even with wife + son), but you should negotiate. Your fixed costs each month would be: rent, groceries (food), travel/commute, phone etc. For rental rates, check kijiji.ca. Groceries can be $400-500. Travel I'd say up to $200. Phone could be easily $200-$250 for 3 people. 

> Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate???

Work permit and then PR sounds about right. Not sure about accuracy of the information. Try canadavisa.com forums and ask there, it is a very active community.

> What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

If you are being offered a job, the company should be taking care of any visa fees. They should even reimburse you if only the applicant is allowed to pay the visa fees by CIC. Clarify this with the company before accepting the offerf.

> It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

I don't think companies have bonds in Canada. You can usually leave work in 2-4 weeks notice (as per terms of employment). And companies can do the same, they can let you go with the same notice. I'd recommend starting in summer so it is easier for you to adopt to the weather

> I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.

Benefits:
- /u/das_halifax did a good job summarizing.

> Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??

Not sure. If you don't find much, let me know and I'll do some research for you.

> Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??

Absolutely not. No NOC required from your job's wife for you to go.

> My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?

 Best bit for you is your son is in a perfect age to hit a jackpot. As I said, I was 16 when we immigrated. Best thing is that Indian high school system is rigorous while in Canada, high school is a breeze (comparatively), while universities are a significant jump in difficulty. At your son's age, he will get a significant advantage as he would already know much of the content in Maths and Science that is taught here in Grade 11 and 12. But he has to grab the opportunity as well. If I were in India, the best I would have thought of was LD college of engineering, or MS University of Baroda, yet I was able to do Engineering from University of Toronto, which is better than any IIT. Keep in mind that he has to grab the opportunity. I had plenty of Indian friends, but almost none of them took the opportunity. I had done 11th standard in India, and had to do 11th and 12th again here. If your son studied in Gujarati medium, he might have to work hard initially. I was in English medium. If he studies all the way until 12th in India, a downside is that now Canadian universities don't know how he measures up against local applicants, and now he might be competing against International applicants. So, better if he is part of Canadian high school system before 12th. (He will likely have to give IELTS (academic module)/TOEFL regardless, btw).

> Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???

Every small town in Canada has it. But no guarantees that you'll like the taste. Often, Indian restaurants in remote towns cater to taste buds of white people than Indians. A tradeoff of not living in Toronto, I guess.

> Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??

Try express entry. Check [CRS tool](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) and see how much you score. As of Oct 2018, people with score of 442 were granted PR.

> 12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?

Please don't go for student visa. You have the right thinking. People come here with admission in any random college. In Canada, college = diploma, university = degree. If he has done bachelors, and working, best bet is for him to get 2-3 years of experience and apply through express entry (try CRS tool for him as well). I know someone who immigrated recently at age of 25 and is doing pretty good. PR from day 1 and none of the struggles that people who come on student visa go through.

I don't think you can sponsor him. He has to apply by himself as he is already 21. He may get additional points if you are a PR/citizen, but not sure. You'll have to confirm with the CRS link above.

> My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

Pleasant weather? Vancouver. But it also rains a lot in Vancouver in summer. Still better than having snow in other parts of Canada though. Vancouver is crazy expensive to live in though, because of chinese black money in real estate. Second, I'd put Toronto. Less snow than other parts of Canada, and even cities like Ottawa, Montreal. Toronto is expensive as well, but Toronto suburbs should work out well.


Concluding thoughts:
- It is a big change to move at age of 50. As you said, you are resetting your social, family life, and business. At this point, you are moving for the sake of your son than yourself. *If it was just you and kaki, I wouldn't recommend immigrating.*
- Please consider the fact that you are also subjecting your wife to a completely new environment, with no relatives around. There are a few Gujaratis in NB now (Moncton, Fredericton etc) but most are international students, so not sure how you'd relate.
- Call me emotional, but it still haunts me that my future generations won't be able to communicate with me in Gujarati if I remain in Canada the rest of my life. Not that they won't know how to, but they won't be comfortable. In 2-3 generations, the language will be wiped out from your family. Also, same thing about good values that might be unique to India. I am still not at peace with this, and am planning on returning back in a couple of years.

PM me if you'd like to discuss more. We can chat over WhatsApp if you'd like. You make the decision, but I can make you aware of all the realities based on the experience I'v gathered here in more than a decade, and that might help you make the decision. Your salary is quite low man, even for N.B. Since you are going with a teenage son, who will enter college, your wife will have to work otherwise you won't be happy at all. Incredibly paltry salary, and there are very few opportunities available in St. Johns for getting higher salary than this. That place has very high unemployment rate. Sort this aspect out, rest everything will fall in place.  I'd advice you to post this in r/canada and r/abcd as well. You might get better answers there. Having traveled to both countries.  100000 times yes 50 is 25 in Canada. You are quite the young man, sir. Good luck. r/iwantout What are you waiting for? As long as you have done homework on validating the PR in 6 months claim, what do you have to lose?  Stay there for 5 to 7 years, become a citizen, get your son a decent shot at life in Canada and if you don’t like it go back. You have worked till 50 and obviously Ahmedabad has not given you what you are looking for otherwise, you would not be thinking about leaving at this stage of life. 

As someone who left India at the age of 17, trust me when I say you will be giving your son the biggest gift any parent can give a child- a gift of choice. 

I say go ahead and don’t look back. Negotiate everything but don’t look back.  Bhaiyya kitni baar bahar gaye ho? Culture shock na ho jaye kahi sare aam chumma chaati karte logo ko dekh kar😂

And the society there is different. So be prepared that Indian way of thinking needs to be changed. 

Weather will be extremely cold compared to gujarat.  It's not worth it. You shall suffer from the lack of food, a familiar natural environment, social life et cetera. Really not a good decision.",Business/Finance,2018-11-11 16:53:29

India and its States: some states are too much populated to govern efficiently,6,9zgjc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9zgjc8/india_and_its_states_some_states_are_too_much/,4,"Hello everyone, let's discuss about our states. We all know that some of our states are too populated to govern efficiently. However, creation of so many smaller states is very difficult. So, we need Autonomous Regions (AR).

For example, UP has close to 200 million people. There are only four countries on earth with more population than UP ! Even Maharashtra and Bihar had 100 million plus people in 2011. West Bengal had more than 91 million in 2011 too. There are only 13 countries on earth with 100 million club. The US state with highest population is California (39 mil), we have 11 states with more than that.

So, it seems that for better serving the populace we need states with lesser population. State governments tend to keep all power in the hands of a select few leaders and thus failed to spread development evenly around the state.

However, dividing our states into smaller one would be very problematic. It would create political shit storms and turmoils so powerful that no central government would withstand that. Just see what happened during the creation of Telengana. 

So, the better solution would be dividing states into semi-autonomous regions. There are 14 such regions already exist in India like Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Kargil, Ladakh etc.

Bigger states should be divided into a few autonomous regions (AR). It would have its own local governments with limited powers.

The AR's could be like that:

1) Population below 10 millions except the Metropolis AR's like Mumbai, Kolkata etc.

2) The local government of the AR should be formed via Panchayet and Municipal elections by their elected members. Another extra election should be avoided.

3) These AR's should have powers and funds for village and town developments, local road constructions, sanitations, health cares, school education, waterbody and forest conservation, tourism development, industrial developments, land and land reforms etc.

4) The state government will control the police, judiciary, state civil services, higher educational institutions, state highways etc.

5) The state government and the central agencies will collect the taxes. The ARs would collect some local taxes like tolls, small business license fees etc. The tax revenues would be distributed among the AR's, state governments and the central government by the rules of the finance commissions.

6) The AR's would have limited legislative powers which would enables them to pass some laws. However, they would be under the legislative authority of the state.

7) So, there could be more than hundreds of such AR. Every metro city city should form its own AR.

Let's debate.
",bikbar1," I didn't read the whole thing cause I'm super sleepy but larger states must be broken, especially UP. It's easier to govern, it's easier to decentralise the power one or a few states hold in national elections, and it gets easier to carry out govt welfare programmes and other schemes, and people can be equally have a larger voice when it comes to holding the system accountable. Also, faster rates of growth, education, gender equality etc etc. Playing the devil’s advocate: is there any analysis to prove that administrative efficiency is directly proportional to size of state? I know it seems intuitive, but is that the only factor we should consider? What are the factors that are really holding back growth on our states? If every thing else remained constant and we only reduced the size, would we see a better result?",Business/Finance,2018-11-23 02:23:53

Feels like people have kind of moved on from that particular fuckery.

Edit: a word >developments in the Supreme court,


Heights of desperation. Nobody has literally any control over the supreme court. It is the most opaque arm of our state, always has been. Stop blaming random shit on modi, your entire argument loses value because you pull shit like this. Can't believe people just automatically upvote anything anti modi without even reading the BS in the post. So it wasn’t since the time of Indira Gandhi?

Modi is the result of the bullshit spawned by Congress over the years. Now, we have the other side corrupting the system to suit their agenda.

I don’t like Modi but I hate Congress worse.  The same SC CJI ruled in favour of AAP govt. in the LG- AAP turf war. 
And why are you blaming Modi, SC judges are appointed by collegium, not our PM Yes, there are several videos and reports which are not from the left per se. its even from centerists who argue this.

Also, you forgot Electoral bonds, which is completely annonmyous way of paying a party.

What factions usually do is try to remove blame from Modi, and pin in on the pre-existing system, absolving the leadership of everything. This is a problem because, the leaderships' inaction, rather...its tweeks to more streamline the process, is in cahoots with the pre-existing system of corruption.

Technically, the present government has not done as much damage as previous ones, but small steps it has taken to legalize corruption, will lead our nation to further ruin.

I am sure that's what our founding fathers would have wanted - ""My father, let my country be led to ruin"" (/s) Generally I think that the more autocratic a government is the more corruption flourishes. This is because fewer people have more power (and so can do bigger scams) and because they face less risks of repercussions. I read somewhere that corruption in India really kicked off with Indira Gandhi, precisely because she was the first leader to centralise a lot of power in just her close advisors/allies Corruption has been a hallmark of indian businesses and politicians way before modi, its like part of its culture and fabric of scoiety that corruption has to exist for things to run at all.

Even some people told me that without corruption, things cant function at all in india, it just depends on whether its big or small. Yeah, it was evident long ago. He's mastered the art of normalizing corruption. They don't even have to hide it. That's why you don't hear about any scams at all these days. If you don't find a view correct please put counter arguments. Downvoting only shows your confirmation bias. Yes. It's pretty good. But I'm hoping with more years in power,I'm hoping they don't make it a competition between people on the ground like the Congress did. Being a Modi supporter I always believed that Modi is doing grate thing for our future. But from past 6 months show different result and different future. Modi made Black money go away as he promised but in process of making policy of making black money harder, he just made making black money a legal and tax paying. Due to the policy other people were Abel to increase profits margins which eventually lead to high rate of products and an increase in dearness. Now due to GST and other policies all the product are almost double in price. Yes, that's the Gujarat model. More money reaches up, less remains for down guys Is 'systemic' appropriate in this case? Isn't it supposed to be more of a biological/medical term? 

Can some vocabulary nazis help out ? I think Modi is doing good job and people know that and appreciates him and thus is voting more and more BJP.

#AccheDinForeva I would happily blame PM Modi for this but corruption has been the system in developing world long before he got the top job. He is making both corruption and genocides systematic  [removed] But....He is making Sardar Patel and Lord Ram statues. He is doing things as per kulcha. Why you want foreigners family to rule india.  [removed] If parties get funding and the donors are known, does it mean citizens are tagged with each party? Does this mean, one cannot work with both sides of aisle?

If taxation is tight, how much of funding will benami attract?

When we start using percentage without evidence, it is as good as sensationalizing. 0.001% of 1 Billion population is 10 million population. Is that less or more? Do you expect all people in the country to be equally rich? or poor? 

 Accha bhai sahab, aap India main hi janaam liye hain na? Corruption has always been systemic in India.  [removed] i nearly read all comments

Some Gyan for aspiring MBA students about which no one will bother to talk,60,84vvjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/84vvjc/some_gyan_for_aspiring_mba_students_about_which/,81,"I am 2013 MBA pass out. 

I am surprised to see so much misplaced expectations and ignorance among MBA aspirants.

I am currently working as a researcher at a think tank that evaluates quality of management education.

So, according to me, here is some general gyan -

Unless you are from top 25 B School in India, your MBA / PGDM is absolutely worthless job wise.

Private B Schools ranked outside rank 25, are only interested in your ""money"". 

Students joining outside 25 rank Private B Schools will face these hardships -

(1) Placement process will be non-transparent, skewed to benefit favorites of the institute, very few good companies.

(2) Lack of summer placements. 

(3) Some even fudge their placement figures.

(4) Average salary declared is almost always untrue.

(5) 100% placement never happens.

(6) Favoritism based on chamcha giri is rampant, you will get better grades/placement based on that.

(7) You will come across relatives or friends of the founder of the private B School posing as ""Faculty"". 

(8) Alumni networking will be non-existent. 

Also, Business Analytics is a new MBA major specialization being offered with traditional Finance/Marketing/HR. 

It makes sense to opt this from job perspective.",Tam-Brahm," Just want to add to the discussion here. I'm a 2018 pass out from one of the new IIM's (set up in 2011) and the picture is not too rosy. If you have expectations of a 12lpa+ package after graduating from an IIM, there are only a few (about 30% of the batch) who have got that.  Placements are very shady and often students are forced to apply to companies which are not even heard of. Our placement process started in Nov, and there are still double digit students left to be placed with our convocation soon.

On the plus side, there is a lot to learn from studying in top 20 B-schools as the alumni interaction and pedagogy is good. All I'm emphasizing on is that the immediate reward of an extremely good job in terms of ROI and role is non-existent in the newer IIM's. What are the top 25 institutions? Seeing the state of top mba colleges ,I'd say top 20 are best. Other than that ,it's useless doing an MBA 

Many of my friends did engineering then immediately mba and now earning 6-7-8 lakhs per annum after spending 6 lakhs for two years ,doesn't make any fucking sense RoI, and brand name play a major role when it comes to do an MBA. I agree with OP to the point that this case of high competition, rat race and missed opportunities exists even among top 10 colleges of the country. Thus, if you are planning to do an MBA, go ahead only if it suits your profile or your expected career progression, and not just because everyone is doing it.  Thanks for posting this - people need to know the kind of fraud MBA education is in many colleges. 

My friend was the secretary of the owner of some private institutions who owned some B and C grade schools and colleges. They decided to start an MBA college and built one fancy looking building within another campus of their college. They were not affiliated with anyone and offered a post-graduate diploma in something-something-MBA. (Note that they are not affiliated to anyone and this diploma is just a worthless piece of paper).

They were having a tough time attracting candidates and one day the CEO asked my friend, her secretary to go and find out what the issue was. He went there during the admission seasons and also joined in with the supporting staff. He managed to convince 12 students to join the institute. The CEO immediately made him the Admission officer for the institute. The next year, the second batch under him got 32 admissions.

The fees in the first year was 8 lakhs and the second year had been hiked to 10 lakhs! 

(After the 2nd year, my friend requested a ""transfer"" to an engineering college so that he wouldn't feel guilty about how he was literally cheating people to do an ""MBA"" that had no value at all.) Where did you do your MBA from, OP? Is Christ University Bangalore any good ? How would you rate the Indian School of Business? CAT 18 aspirant here(not serious as per now), currently studying in an average engineering college. 

80% chances that I will be placed in a mass recruiting company. 

MS from abroad or MBA from India, as a fresher.? Don't downvote, ik both of them are completely different but my aim is to get a good package and a better life (the reason abroad). I belong from a middle class family but parents are ready to spend around 40lakhs for education. Hows fore and symbiosis? Which was your MBA institution?  [deleted] How's SCMHRD? Asking for my sister who's planning to do MBA this year  Just a clarification, what constitutes top 25 though?

Rankings in India are very different in different systems. I'd say the Old IIMs come first, then MDI, XLRI, FMS, IIFT & SPJIMR. Some IITs are also in the top 25. Any particular list to follow? You can read this article .....

(1) Whether he should get back into IT industry as he has 4.5 year's of coding experience in C#. If yes, what steps.

and

(2) Whether to pursue law as his MBA Finance has given him good exposure to Mergers And Acquisitions (M&A),  Business laws and Taxation.

I am asking your help/advice/suggestion for Query No (2) i.e, He wants to study law at the age of 36 years.

He is appearing for these law exams in 2018 -

CLAT, IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam and DU LLB exam.

He says that there is no age limit for studying law and practicing law. 

Is there any merit to it ? (I don't know anything about careers after law education.)

His family supports him wholeheartedly, but they need clarity on how exactly can pursuing LLB law education help my friend at the age of 36.

Please, Please upvote for visibility.

Edit:

Being a cancer survivor, my friend was unemployed close to 3-4 years during his cancer treatment.

Recently, he secured a part time decent teaching job that can become full time.

His family is unhappy that he will resign from his present job, which he secured through lots of effort against all odds.

So, Is there any merit in his decision to take up law education at this age.",Tam-Brahm," I know multiple people with MBAs and PhDs who did an LLB in their 30s and 40s to start consultancies in various business related fields. None of them are practising lawyers but doing the course opened a lot of doors in terms of career opportunities. It adds a lot to your profile, depending on what field you're trying to enter. Benefits greatly in finance, investing and startup entrepreneurship consulting.

IMO it's a great move. Luckily for your friend, this is the first year that CLAT has no age limit after the supreme court made a verdict that said so. He might have to get used to all other students being half his age! lol On a slightly different note. Such a question would've been unthinkable in a developed country. This is one area I'm genuinely envious of. There should be no prejudice about age when it comes to learning. 

I hope he does go ahead and studies. We don't have enough people actually willing to study.  > IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam

IITs have Law programs too, now ? I did llb around 10 yrs back, not practicing. I had a classmate 60+, only reason he did was because he wanted to ""learn more"". Very nice person, he once fought with traffic police as his car was towed from legal parking area. Traffic constable brought back his car, and said sorry to him. 

Llb 3 years course is for those holding graduation. 5 years for 12 pass. Attending classes is compulsory if you are in good college and no one cares in many others, I had 4% in my second year. So attending evening or full time should consider the college he gets admitted too.

While studying and reading the cases is very interesting, practicing would mean spending many years with zero to very low income. Many of my friend still makes less than 10k a month. This is where top law school matters. If you are graduate of such place then getting into good law firms get easy.

I believe everyone should do Llb. No matter what you do it helps to know the law. DU law admits people only upto 30 years of age

Not sure about the IIT it doesnt have a great rep though, a law school needs years of establishment to have good faculties. Most of what Ive heard about IIT law course was the teaching is terrible  If he has ample financial reserves in the form of alternative income/rent/ancestral property, it can be a very good option. Only the very few in India can truly dedicate themselves to litigation without running after money. On the other hand if you think of making money from Law after entering it at age 36, you are likely to be disappointed.

Easy and quick money in Law is only in Transactional Law (i.e. drafting up agreements/affidavits/documents and registering them etc.) and in consultancy/advisory (eg: being on a businessman's negotiating team while he/they negotiate an agreement/merger/tie-up with a potential partner).. Transactional practice can be independent/self-employed as well, infact most low-level low-skilled independent lawyers make money through drafting agreements of leave and license, rather than appearing before a Court. You can make 30-35 K per month from drafting rent agreements and affidavits, you can barely hope to make 15 K per month from fighting cases in court. Even the better known Law Firms in Mumbai do not offer their freshers 30-35 K p.m. as starting salary.

An area in Litigation is indeed profitable but it is cornered by the niche profession of **Solicitor Firms.**   Few solicitor firms will agree to recruit someone at 36 years of age. 

The best thing is someone who owns huge profitable land/rent independently practising Law in the Courts, i.e. actually pleading before a Court. Thats how the profession used to be in Pre-Independence India. Why should there be any age limit to study. Ageism is part of casteism. I guess, there is no age limit for learning.

*For preparation of CLAT, u may suggest this free CLAT mock test site - https://www.cybermocktest.com/clat/*  If he already has masters degree why doesn't he just take a NET exam and teach? Law undergrad student from NLU Patiala, here.

I’m sure your friend has a graduation degree, so I will not suggest going for CLAT, since it is particularly for a 5 year course which is integrated course pursued by students after their 12th. The variants of these courses depending upon the NLU are BA. LL.B(hon), B.Sc. LLB, BBA LLB. etc.
5 years for a course is too much, when he can successfully pursue a 3years LL.B. degree. I will suggest checking out BVP Pune, BHU, etc.
It’s a much better utilisations of his time and resources too, given that a five-year course is very intensive with compulsory attendance and 2 lacs in fees in a year (approx.) if you consider the NLUs and other top colleges.

I would recommend a 3year course from a reputed state university over 5 year course through CLAT.
 Never too late for education and starting afresh aiming for a goal.


He'd just need to keep the eligibility criterias in check. May I know which city your friend is based out of?  In my time at law school, I have seen 40-50 somethings sitting with us 20 year old kids. 

Good thing about law is, it doesn't have age limits and or any retirement age. Some state bar councils do have 45 year age limit, I am not sure if it was challenged in court, but that's a non-issue. 

It can be a task to learn nuances and practicalities of legal practice when you're 30 plus but it's not a challenge big enough to be a roadblock for him to take up law.

Best of luck to your friend  I study in a CLAT affiliated institute. We have never had anyone his age study here. Thats because CLAT institutions don't have a 3 year LLB course. We only have a 5 year BA LLB course or a BBA LLB course. So he'll have to shift to another city for 5 years and go to class everyday with 17-18 year olds. Ask him not to give clat and research about colleges which give the LLB degree alone. For that, he should already have 
a graduate degree like BA, BSc or BBA. Many factors need to considered:


He will feel the age gap a lot, especially if in a 5 year program but also in some 3 year programs since many students join straight after college. The exception to this is probably DU and GLC, mumbai. The reason for that is attendance is not an issue and DU still has evening batches. These attract older candidates who are working during the day and also UPSC aspirants who have law as a back up. Your friend will find it easier to gel with the crowd at such places. 


Your friend might be able to continue working while studying. Even more so if it’s a teaching job and it’s part time. Those can be kind of chill and he is already working there, so cancer-based discrimination may be low. 


Regarding placements: HR recruiters will want cheap workers with no baggage. Hence, ageism crops up. Law schools (all colleges for that matter) are factories and unfortunately, your friend will be an outlier. He is highly experienced in diverse fields. This is bad and good. Recruiters won’t know what to do with him or he will get a offer appropriate for a 21 year old. It can be good if he finds a job that values his experience in B.Tech, MBA etc but that takes a lot of hustling to find. Yet he will have to explain 4 years of unemployment. Truth is, his classmates will be safer bets and his getting recruited through the formal placement process will be tough. 


Litigation stream is always an option. It’s slow work in the beginning but he’d be self employed or in a small firm.


Him being a cancer-survivor, if I were in his shoes, I’d opt for a college with chill attendance, continue with the teaching. Write the LLB exams. Build up contingencies for a cancer relapse (good insurance, access to healthcare, savings). Then carry on with life with the above priority (job with health benefits, low stress) and try to be happy. 

TLDR: technically, age is no barrier. Still, it’ll be tough. He should consider part-time and retain his day job. It is doable. Cancer changes everything. Relapse is a risk that he will have to mitigate always. [deleted]",Business/Finance,2018-03-23 21:46:03
The Kerala Model,143,79u1il,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/79u1il/the_kerala_model/,159,"Let's have an objective discussion of the merits & sustainability of the Kerala model. Please don't downvote if you merely disagree. 



1. Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries. 





3. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foeign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.

[Source](https://medium.com/@thousifmohammed/why-kerala-rank-last-in-ease-of-doing-business-7da7ed96d113) 


5. Consequently, abysmal FDI inflows, at just over US$1.2billion in 2000-15 (the last 15 years), just 0.5% of total inflows. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka received over US$17billion and US$16billion respectively in the same period. [Source](http://indien.ahk.de/fileadmin/ahk_indien/Bilder/2015_News_and_Info/economic_news/collab_-fdi_into_india.pdf)




6. High Debt/GSDP of 29.7% (2015 Budget Estimate) compared to an India-average of 21.2%. Though that's an estimate, the 2014 Revised Estimate was 31% and 2013 actual one was 31.6%. I would take the estimate with a grain of sand. [Source](http://niti.gov.in/content/debt-total-outstanding-liabilities-percenatge-gsdp) This is also with them having a monopoly over the liquor industry through BEVCO, and one of the highest per-capita consumption levels of alcohol by state. (That's cool, I have no issues with alcohol.)



7.

2. And finally, **the extreme dependence on remittances:** Remittances finance as many as 20% Kerala households, or 2.4 million families. Assuming a family size of three, remittances directly affect 7.2 million of 35 million Keralites, according to a recent paper in the Economic and Political Weekly by K C Zachariah and S Irudaya Rajan based on the Kerala Migration Survey, 2014. [Source](http://www.firstpost.com/india/gulf-remittances-to-kerala-drop-to-four-year-low-due-to-declining-oil-prices-2738866.html)



* Remittances, at Rs 70,000 crore, accounted for 36.3% of the net state domestic product (NSDP) in 2014.



* Remittances constitute a fourth — Rs 22,689 of Rs 86,180 — of the per capita income of Kerala in 2014.



* Remittances were 1.2 times the revenue generated by the Kerala government in 2014. 



____



I like this summary: **“Remittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy,”** said S. Irudaya Rajan, a demographer at the Center for Development Studies, a local research group. “There would have been starvation deaths in Kerala if there had been no migration. The Kerala model is good to read about but not practically applicable to any part of the world, including Kerala.” [Source: NYTimes- Jobs Abroad Support ‘Model’ State in India.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/world/asia/07migrate.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1) It's a pretty good read.






",pure_haze," Damn you OP, I was expecting some mallu models

(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ Regarding the high crime rate in kerala: 

https://youtu.be/2EH6OWMUCnI

You may skip to 3:45 Every state has dependence on something. I just think that Kerala does the right things with their money. The risk associated with this source is questionable but the money itself is used in improving HDI and not just 'bijness' related indicators.

Their economy and employment is dependent on three things mainly - tourism, gelf and Bangalore. Maybe their next target itself is to reduce this dependency.

The debate is very nuanced with guys like Bhagwati and Sen arguing the merits of Gujarat and Kerala models. With economics, there are no right answers. It's just whatever works.

Now let's take the other extreme - Haryana. The economic indicators are off the charts. But people still hold onto their outdated beliefs and some parts of the state also has law and order problems and is regarded unsafe for women. Now is this development and is it sustainable? >Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. 

And why was so UP being in Ganga belt had historically been a rich place of poor people . Kerala had better indicator at independence bcoz it had  and has better society . And still today UP is a highly divided society .


For Japanese miracle and their industrialization , their homogeneity and social structure played an important foundation part  As a Keralite, I find the chest thumping to be a ridiculous show-off at best and the communist revisionism to hijack all the achievements at the worst. We will be facing dire issues when the middle-east slows down significantly. I personally know so many young men pinning their futures on some small job in the gulf. 

Trade unions must be reigned in and the ease of doing business has to improve. It won't happen overnight, but that will be the greatest thing the current left government can do and only a left government can do.

I really wish there was a way for me to return to my hometown. As of now, the only way I can sustain my current income if I move back is to go freelance, and that is being optimistic. To be fair, a govt can do investment in social welfare without being communist. Just look at what Mamata Banerjee is doing in Bengal, despite me hating her, she has done some good work in mgnrega, improving the hospitals from their dismayl state, and overall improving rural infrastructure. 

The fiscal deficit and high debt you mentioned was common in communist govt of Bengal too. When the Left left, we had a high debt of over 1.5 lakh crore, and the current govt is not doing anything either to reign it. 

My main issue with Kerala model is that it can't be implemented anywhere else. It works for them, good, but we need some other way to lift other states. I like breaking big states to smaller, and then working on them. Likewise, we can produce replicas of Goa which have decent social infrastructure as well as good enough ease of doing business to lift people up.  One of the less spoken advantages of Kerala is that most of its population is either in the cities or live in close proximity to cities. I believe factors like high HDI and low IMR are because of this. 

But regardless of what brought about its high development, I think the Kerala model cannot be adopted by rest of the states. If we are looking to emulate, I guess the Tamil Nadu model of socialism has proven successful. TN may not be Kerala, but is often #2 or #3 on most counts. Again, one advantage that TN has/had that a state like UP does not is that Madras has been a prominent administration city since pre-independence. But I think any benefits from that are minimal at the moment.  Radicalization is a problem in Islam itself. I don't think the rates of radicalization are more in kerala in comparison to an equivalent Muslim population of that number elsewhere.  Do you have a source for this? While OP is raising legitimate points about Kerala’s economy, you seem to be missing the whole point about Kerala model. 

Kerala model is that It has achieved very high material Quality of life/human development indicators, despite being A low income state.

The reason it is called a model is because it is unique. Pretty much everywhere else in the world economic growth and quality of life or Human development go hand-in-hand but strangely Kerala Managed to improve material quality of life with little economic growth.

By arguing that Kerala’s economic growth track record may be considered abysmal, though a fair point, you are only reinforcing the concept of Kerala model.

Nobody calls Kerala an economic miracle, everybody knows it is not. 

Is it a replicatable model? Maybe not. Is it the key to solving the problems across the country? Definitely doesn’t seem like it. 

Has historic circumstances contributed? Perhaps. But historic and geographic reasons also limits its economic potential too. So that is argument that cuts both ways. 

Now, i would say it is facetious to argue that the outcomes have solely been due to the gulf boom, Because the impact of the gulf boom on Kerala really began only in the late 80s. 

Kerala Declared hundred percent literacy in the early 90s, which would not have been possible without strong government policies over the years. 

Also some of the places with most gulf NRIs, such as Malappuram, are actually some of the most backward areas in Kerala.  


And to give credit to the Travancore royal family is laughable, because if that were the case then many regions in Southern Tamil Nadu today was part of the  erstwhile Travancore kingdom. While, parts of the Travancore kingdom that is in Kerala have done extremely well, parts that are with Tamil Nadu have yet to catch up. Also Travancore kingdom is probably covered less than 30% of modern Kerala. 

It is very clear that the most significant government policy that laid the foundation for this transformation was the massive wealth redistribution program launched by the first Kerala government, which was a communist government. 

So, what has the Kerla model achieved? Fewer children are dying, fewer mothers are dying, there are fewer illiterate people. More and more people are getting skilled, hence are able to find higher paying jobs, albeit, elsewhere. I would argue that we are yet to yield dividends of Kerala model. 

So, yes it is a model. Is it the best model? it is hard to say. Has it its own advantages? Oh yes definitely. 
 The riot cases are high because almost everything is registered and reported.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokku_kooli

One of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard of. *Upvotes*

*Grabs popcorn*

**Let the games begin.** I think best things that happened to Kerala were, Progressive Travancore state, Early Communist government and lots of christian missionaries.

Christian missionaries and Progressive Travancore state meant that the state had a robust education system. providing for a progressive and good labor base for development. 

Communist govt took land from absentee landlords and redistributed land among landless laborers. Also, brought social parity by working against caste system. Social parity is very much a prerequisite for economic growth. Kerala achieved is much earlier than others.

State couldn't take full advantage of it's lead, but remittances or not, it did have a headstart on other states in early independence days. > 2. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foreign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.

True. But like @i_hate_circlejerk and many others have mentioned, there is an aversion to blue collar work in Kerala. It's not because of the unavailability of jobs. It's not the best feature to have, but this happens in most emancipated societies. This is more of an issue of how daily wage work is seen from a societal perspective.  > merits & sustainability of the Kerala model

Seems to more Kerala thrashing than anything else. Don't see too many merits mentioned :) Kerala has a lot of things going for it, and I'd rather be here than anywhere else in India. But it has its own challenges as well, just like any other state.

What Malayalis should do is to not gloat too much about how they are better that this or that state in India, but really look at where they are falling short.

The reality is that if the gulf money dries up, Kerala is fucked. Either produce capital and expertise in the state, or leave your beautiful homeland to work in possibly unfriendly places for those who have it.  Why so much unemployment in kerala?  [deleted] > Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%.

And that 47% started off from 0, thanks to Kerala's proclivity to open up and mix with other cultures. The various social reformation movements, and influx of Christian missionaries among many other factors contributed to this. Who claimed it was all post-independence Govts? The EMS Govt. though, made giant strides in post-independence Kerala through it's [education bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Education_Act_1958_(Act_6_of_1959)) - it's not _all_ post independence, but a _lot_ _was_ post independence

>  Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foreign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.

True. But like @i_hate_circlejerk and many others have mentioned, there is an aversion to blue collar work in Kerala. It's not because of the unavailability of jobs. It's not the best feature to have, but this happens in most emancipated societies. This is more of an issue of how daily wage work is seen from a societal perspective. 

>  Political Violence

Violence is never a good thing, but Political violence is slightly different. Political awareness among a population is generally considered to be a prime metric in considering the collective intelligence and societal emancipation of a region. In Kerala, political awareness is super high. This is often misused by parties, but political killings like what the BJP (RSS) have been spreading, are super low. The only political killings that do happen in Kerala are always RSS - CPI (M), in North Kerala. While these are highly condemnable, they are exceedingly rare.

And also, **crime metrics are reported and recorded much more stringently in Kerala, thanks to a well functioning executive**. You might remember a report about how Scandinavia had reported extreme high cases of sexual assault. Similar situation (though high influx of migrants is also a problem there).

> Hotbed for ISIS recruitement

This seems to be the most ridiculous of them all. Almost right out of the RSS playbook. Quoting the exact same article you've quoted: 

> India’s Muslim population, the third largest in the world, has so far contributed negligible numbers to Isis – fewer than 90 people, according to most estimates. “More have gone from Britain, even from the Maldives, than India,” 

Sure, Wahhabism is a growing threat in Kerala, and more and more muslims seem to be drawn to it. But the absolute numbers here are abysmally small and can't really be considered a metric at all.


> And finally, the extreme dependence on remittances

Remittances undeniably drive a bulk of Kerala's economy. You've provided good numbers, sure. What is your point though? Agriculture and brain drain might be flipsides to it, but comparing to other states that _do_ depend on Agriculture, isn't it better that people are employed abroad and are bringing money into the economy rather than flail about in abject poverty? It is funding a flourishing society, and Malayalis have built up vast business empires abroad. And are employing thousands of Indians.

According to this logic, all of the IT engineers flocking to Bangalore, are bad for the nation, because they should be doing Agriculture, and not depend on the US for offshore development projects.




***PS: Kerala has a bunch of issues. Treatment and safety of women, fewer opportunities for employment etc. are clear and present problems. But OP seems to be more interested in painting a comprehensively poor picture of the state, misrepresenting facts. Source - 22 years in Kerala.*** >wants to discuss merits

>Points out only demerits

Yeah, OP is clearly unbiased.
 Thanks OP. As a Keralite, I felt that the whole Kerala-is-best circlejerk on randia was getting out of hand. This was sorely needed.

 3;really? lot of repetitive points.. sanghis are putting in lot of effort in researching about Kerala these days.. such sincere hardwork should be appreciated.. but cherry picking facts to peddle some agenda is not right

you can't judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree

very high population density is not suitable for manufacturing & related jobs.

Huge pressure on land means less agricultural output & heavy dependence on imports

> extreme dependence on remittances

are you trying to spin this off as some sort of insult? it's not because it means human resource is the biggest asset of Kerala.

All these people went through the hurdles of getting a passport & visa in a country where millions can't even read or write. [removed] 1. We have always been more progressive than the rest of the country. That is not a negative mark.

2. We have the low-pay jobs the rest of India counts as employment. We just leave those to out-of-state workers. We do indeed have a problem with not having the a sufficient number of higher end jobs as compared to our output of graduates. This point of yours is partially legitimate.

3. Sweden is the rape capital of the world. /s

4. We do business by the book. There is less bribery and more regulation; that makes things harder.

5. Refer previous point.

6. Debt/GSDP being a bit higher is not bad. I don't know why anyone would think that.

7. This is really the only fully legitimate point in your post.

8. This is a just a laughable talking point right out of the sangh playbook. We are better educated so we get more job opportunities abroad. Deal with it.",Business/Finance,2017-10-31 14:41:07
TL;DR – Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev,543,6s4hoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6s4hoh/tldr_godman_to_tycoon_the_untold_story_of_baba/,95,"Context – Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

Edit 1: Formatting

Edit 2: Woah! Thanks for the Gold kind stranger. Though I would rather have people reading the book. While Indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged. That will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men, policies, events etc. ",rahultheinvader," Dude, thank you. This was really good. When you mentioned in that thread I knew I'd never read the book but I did want to know a gist.  [OP that delivers is the best kind of OP](http://i.imgur.com/Tyu0M4y.jpg).

PS, Author's take on this book:

> [I’d be Naive Not to Worry About a Fallout](https://www.thequint.com/books/2017/07/31/priyanka-pathak-narain-author-of-explosive-ramdev-biography)

Really good interview.  >Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR.

Ramdev is a shady dude Thanks. I had pre-ordered the book on Amazon the day it became available, but it hasn't yet reached me. I learned about the ebook on Juggernaut from your post and got a copy. I'm more than halfway through the book now, this guy is no swami, he's not even a hard nosed businessman, he's a mobster.

**Edit:** Finished the book a while back, thought I should update. Took less than three hours to read, was interesting enough to read in one sitting. Not badly written at all, saw the author went to Columbia to study journalism, it shows in the tight narrative and objective stance. It's clear that the author wanted to cover the less seen perspective, which makes this more of an investigative journalism piece than a biography. It's taken some effort to put this all together, but it's not a multi year ground breaking effort. Nevertheless very timely, and shows the murky underbelly. Lala Ramdev is incredibly ambitious, and since ambition is violence, he's quite ruthless and violent. It's a psych profile [probably true for many CEOs and top politicians who have all been found to have psychopathic tendencies.] (http://time.com/32647/which-professions-have-the-most-psychopaths-the-fewest/)

It's a rags to riches story of ruthless ambition. Also an example of what yoga without yama/niyama (dos and don'ts) can do, it can provide incredible energy for mischief. Even before reading this, I never trusted in Ramdev as a spiritual godman, but still didn't actively disapprove of him since I just considered him to be a businessman.
But reading your post has made me realize that he is a pretty terrible human being who feeds off the faith of the gullible.

Thanks for the post mate. You have completely changed my perception.

TL;DR. ""New shit has come to light."" I do not know the truth behind the facts presented in that book but based on what you have written it seems that this Baba knows how to gain people's trust and then punishes them for trusting him. In a way he is teaching them all a lesson for trusting him by exploiting their weaknesses.

For example, Shankar Dev and Karamveer seem to have had very high ideals and when they wanted to hand pick somebody to carry on their legacy out of all the people they chose Ramdev. It shows that these people were terrible at judging who is a real disciple and who is not. This is fucking scary man... Fuck! OP, this is great. I had always known there was something behind Rajeev Dixit's death. 

Just like he says to boycott Chinese goods, I think we should all boycott Patanjali goods.  Gangs of Wasseypur wali feeling aati hai story padh kar.

This is scary AF side of this FMCG empire.
 So as expected, this baba is nothing but a fraud who built his empire on top of lies, deceit and murders.

Thank you OP. Somebody need to make a hindi TLDR. thanks for the summary, was looking for a kindle version and couldn't find. great that you pointed to the app by Juggernaut. MF businessman. Now no buying of his products. Future Anurag Kashyap movie.  top class post.  one of the coolest reads Someone should make a series like narcos on him. I want baba ramdev mobile phone all made with haridwar hardware. Ecologically friendly and swadeshi. Any proofs in the book..? Great job OP and nice summary. You have already done good work but if you added the timeline it will be more helpful in keeping things into perspective. 

Though not surprising at all there are a few interesting tidbits here and there. As you said

>His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon.

This is such a shame. Wonderful write up. Thanks for your efforts  Great job OP. Thanks a lot for spreading the light. You're making randia great again. 😂 OP is this book available in Hindi ? Good concise write up. Good job OP. Thank you. 👍👌 Movie banao koi iski life pe Bisi  Ramdev killed Dixit? Big fan of the baba now. Good read, thank you OP for your Quality contributions. As long as people believe these Godmans blindly they will milk them as much as possible.  Mine=blown gonna drop my career and become a baba now We know most of the baba ramdev products are shit. But why they are still popular ? They are very cheap for a normal lower middle class man. His advertisments reach common lower middle class man reliably well. Where as same cheap products are sold double the price abroad like in USA and uk. Soon his products will find high end price across the globe. Does it mean, anyone with specialized skill can grow to this level? Why anyone hasn't done? 

What do you think Ramdev baba will do with this amassed wealth? 

Karma always works, looks what is happening with Sonia and Rahul?

Are you guys feeling happy with existing FMCG products like Maggie, why not crib about it?

In India, there are enough people who are jealous about other's prosperity, indeed you can find them here too.

fellas take chill and learn from good things.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.


",unfitforoffice," Wow. TLDR? Wow what a nice read. But there was no mention of famines or partitions. Were they not back-breaking for the economy? [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. 
 >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. 

I'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice ""peaceful."" Have read the whole thing.
The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Personally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. 

Both Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor's British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because ""he is one of us"". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the ""it"" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because ""they stand for Hindu values"" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife's) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.

It is really simplistic to claim Britain ""looted"" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India's wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor's fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he's going to use this wave of false patriotism that's been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is ""overall a good thing"" even if it did help turn someone's life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

As I've been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides, accepting English IS decolonization. Glad to see an academic agree. I can drink his urine straight from source Brilliant.

We really need to talk about Flairs.,107,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",Business/Finance,2017-05-15 21:21:16

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

>The 508km-long Mumbai to Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) is scheduled for completion in December 2023, but commencement date has been sought to be advanced to August 2022.

>Initially, each high speed train will have 10 cars and the capacity to accommodate 750 people, The Times of India said. It will increase to 16 cars that will accommodate 1,200 people.

>According to initial estimates, around 1.6 crore people are expected to travel by the bullet train annually. By 2050, around 1.6 lakh commuters should travel by the high-speed train on a daily basis.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

BloombergQuint explains it well here:

https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2017/11/28/should-depositors-fear-the-new-financial-resolution-deposit-insurance-bill

ELI5 version: Say you are a bank and you have given out money to several entities. Say those entities are not able to return the money, so they become NPAs. What can a bank do in this situation?

* Do a bail out. 
* Do a bail in. 
* Go bankrupt and close down. 

The point of note here: These are the last steps that a bank  takes, there are several ways that the bank tries to recover money at first - selling the assets of the entity, selling the entity itself, issuing bonds to raise more money and avoiding bankruptcy, not issuing profits as dividends and absorbing them to solve NPAs, downsizing and firing staff etc. Infact, in the new bankruptcy laws which is already in place, the banks have the power to take over the entity and try to turn it around so that it becomes capable to pay off it's debts. Incase that's not possible, it can sell the entity itself and keep all the proceeds to itself, which is what's happening for some of the steel companies in India which form the largest NPAs. The promoters and owners of the said entity don't get any profits from the sale. 

With great bankruptcy laws, banks in developed nations are able to recover upto 60 % of NPAs. However, rates in India are low, only 20% of NPAs get recovered. 

Now imagine a hypothetical scenario where the bank has no other option but to use the last three options I discussed above. So what should it do?

With a bail out - the tax payers of the country give money to recover the bank. 

With a bail in - the depositors and customers absorb some losses and give money to recover the bank. 

Note: Whether a bail out or a bail in, it's the people who are going to pay for the recovery of the banks. Also note, every person who participates in an economy is a tax payer - whether of direct tax or indirect tax. 

Now comes the interesting part: RBI has insured all deposits in the banks to a sum of 1 lakhs. So if a bank goes bankrupt, you are insured a sum of upto 1 lakh and you can claim that amount from RBI. 

So what has changed in this law? Two things:

* The law has given the power to RBI to change the insured amount. This is necessary because when this 1 lakh insurance limit was set, it was in 1970s and it used to be a big amount then. 
* **Insured deposits do not come under bail in. ** Which is why the title that banks can wipe out your money is incorrect. 

What changes for you because of this law:

* Previously, without bail in option, if the bank was not bailed out, you could have claimed a maximum of 1 lakh from RBI as insured money. With bail in option, that remains the same, your insured amount of 1 lakhs is what you can claim if the bank goes bankrupt. 

* In extreme screnio, banks can take your deposits and bail in with that to save itself. However, if that point arrives, a bank going bankrupt is more disastrous than a bail in. 

Either way, people pay if bank get unrecoverable NPAs, either through taxes, or through deposits. Which is a better option is a point of debate. What's not a point of debate is that we need to strengthen our financial institutions, keep them away from political influence - one way is privitizing them, and get more robust bankruptcy laws application.  Because it is pointless fear mongering.

We had this discussion a few days ago. What do you think happens today if a Bank fails and the government does not choose to bail it out?

You lose all your money above 1 lakh and go sue the Bank.

The Bail In clause actually benefits you because you're going to be placed above bond interests because those Bonds will be used to recapitalize too, before coming after your deposits.

The matter of contention is that now the entity comes under scrutiny before actual failure, and that is a *good* thing. My bone with it is why do we need a separate corporation instead of empowering the RBI, but that's a different matter.

Seriously, what do you think the laws are today?

 So, if a bank has rising NPAs people will move accounts to a safer bank. Then the bank collapses on itself, from reducing accounts and rising NPAs? Because baa baa black sheep,have you any fools?


Yes sir,yes sir,one country full. This is extremely scary. Banks give huge loans to the wealthy and influential. They default and to cover the bank's losses, the depositers also take a 'hair cut'. For the money they forego, they are given equity in the bank which in most cases, will not be anywhere close to the extent of deposit used in 'bail in'. Same thing happened in Cyprus Bhaiyya bail out aur bail in nahi, gau out or gau in. Hamar dau dau bachiya hai. Kuch saal baad gau ban jaayi. Because There is no provision of cancellation of Deposits. 'Bail In' exempts Deposits and other liabilities while there is also provision of Insurance on every deposit account so your money remain safe. Bail In is the last resort to get you the money Depositors and Creditors apart from ₹100000 insurance money. As usual media is peddling fake news.

No Progress on the Panama Papers! Despite over 1800 Indian Names Disclosed!,258,63lhl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63lhl9/no_progress_on_the_panama_papers_despite_over/,77,"NO PROGRESS ON THE PANAMA PAPERS. OVER 1800 INDIAN NAMES HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED.

""The Panama Papers illuminate a key aspect of why the system isn’t working–because globalization has allowed the capital and assets of the 1 % (be they individuals or corporations) to travel freely, while those of the 99 % cannot.

Globalization is supposed to be about the free movement of people, goods, and capital. But in fact, the system is set up to enable that mobility mainly for the rich (or for large corporations).

The result is global tax evasion, the offshoring of labor, and an elite that flies 35,000 feet over the problems of nation states and the tax payers within them.""


PANAMA: No questions asked!

The ways of India’s rich and famous are increasingly becoming public knowledge. The disclosure that as many as five hundred prominent Indian’s, including Incredible India’s latest brand ambassador - Amitabh Bachchan, owned offshore companies in Panama is just the latest of the unraveling. All one can say is that he is in the good company of the likes of Vladimir Putin, David Cameron and Nawaz Sharif among others.

Panama is a small sliver of a country in Central America joining North and South America. Its immediate geographical neighbors are Costa Rica in the north and Colombia in the south. It is the narrow isthmus that separates the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. A 77 kilometers long manmade canal capable of accommodating large ships joins the two oceans. The revenues from this were for long the nations biggest source of income since the canal opened in 1914.

Panama soon found that becoming a tax haven that assured investors of their privacy provided a more lucrative income. The proximity to the Americas, and the balmy Caribbean islands, and countries like Colombia with its huge cocaine production and export business, and Latin America’s many kleptomaniac tin pot dictators made Panama even more attractive. Till not long ago the Canal Zone was under the protection of US troops and that too served as an incentive for Americans seeking an offshore tax haven.

Panama is a tax haven, which means it is a country that offers foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a fairly politically and economically stable environment. Tax havens also provide little or no financial information to foreign tax authorities. This in short is the reason Panama is so important to our moneyed people who have good reason to hide their real wealth.

Why do the rich then want to hide their wealth? This is simply because officially they are not as wealthy as they really are. And if they honestly declared their true wealth they would not only be liable to pay more income tax but could also open many of them to various charges of corporate fraud and malfeasances that could earn them hefty prison terms.
To comprehend this one must understand how most of our “captains of industry” many of whom sit on the Prime Ministers Council of Trade and Industry became rich and powerful?

When an “industrialist” launches a new project, the project costs are usually hugely overstated. The suppliers of plant and machinery then pay the promoter kickbacks, which become the promoter capital. Thus, the more the number of projects an individual promotes the wealthier he or she becomes. But it is not income you can declare. So it gets hidden in a tax haven. This is how the big bucks are made and salted away.

A good part of this money is round tripped back to India via nearby tax havens like Mauritius or Singapore. Not surprisingly in 2015 the top FDI investing countries were Mauritius (27%) and Singapore (21%). Both are now the home of hundreds of corporate entities that act as a pass through for funds being held overseas for Indians or Indian entities. These countries are little more than cutouts for monies held in other more distant tax havens like Panama, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Lichtenstein. The smaller the country the more pliable the officials.

The fourteen PSU banks control almost 80% of the commercial credit advanced in India. In addition the government also owns the two big project finance institutions, IDBI and IFCI, and large institutional investors like LIC and general insurance companies like Oriental and GIC. The state ownership of these, with powers vested with the powers that be in New Delhi, political and bureaucratic, ensures that the projects are suitably “gold plated” without any rigorous scrutiny. And why scrutinize when projects seldom fold up and in a system where restructuring means lending more money to evergreen the loans?

The list of NPA’s includes almost the entire roster of top Indian companies. As of June 2016, the total amount of Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for public and private sector banks is around Rs. 6 lakh crore. The NPA figures along with total debt for each of the 49 public and private sector banks were shared by the Ministry of Finance in response to a Parliament question. According to RBI estimates, the top 30 loan defaulters currently account for one-third of the total gross NPA’s of PSU banks. Till March 31, 2015, the country’s top five PSU banks had outstandings of Rs 4.87 lakh crore to just 44 borrowers, if borrowers were to be categorized in terms of those having outstandings of over Rs 5,000 crore. These businesses include Essar, Reliance ADAG, Jaiprakash Associates, Adani's, GVK, GMR and Lanco. Some of them like Essar have defaulted in the before. This stress problem is fairly endemic.

Of the big companies or groups only Tata’s, Reliance Industries and AV Birla can be considered free of financial stress. Most if not all the money earned by gold plating plant and machinery, under invoicing of exports and over invoicing of imports is retained abroad. Has anyone wondered why the UAE is the second largest destination of India’s merchandise exports ($33 billion in 2015) and third largest source of merchandise imports ($26.2 billion in 2015)?

The UAE is also the largest source of legal and illicitly imported gold. Last year India officially imported over 900 tons of gold worth $35 billion. The mysteriously owned corporations incorporated in tax havens like Panama mostly finance these exports. And a good part of the illicitly exported gold also.

According to Global Financial Integrity, a Washington DC based think-tank; Indians were estimated to have illicitly sent out $83 billion in 2015. Where does this money go? Countries like Switzerland that offer banking secrecy usually do not pay any interest on such deposits. So money goes to corporations in tax havens from where they are invested in businesses world over. Have you ever wondered how many of our top businessmen have managed to become so big overseas so soon?
This is where the Panama’s of the world come in. 

There was a time when Panama in India was synonymous with a cheap brand of cigarettes manufactured by the Dalmia Golden Tobacco Company. In the West, Panama was a man's wide-brimmed straw hat made from the leaves of the Toquilla tropical palm tree. That Panama too is now forgotten. Now Panama is synonymous with offshore corporations and assured secrecy. The times have changed.

http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/money-laundering/article17753382.ece [removed] What? You seriously think there is gonna be an investigation...lol. People are so naive.I pity them. Even Pakistan had more protest than here when Nawaz Sharif was named in Panama papers. Tells you how shitty the situation is if we have to look up to pak. Personally, I stopped giving a fuck about it long time back. This is because, I feel tax evasion is not that serious of a crime. I mean, yes they broke the law and everything but if you think about it, it doesn't compares with the likes of coalgate, fodder scam etc. They did not steal public money or anything. Chances are, many of us would have done the same thing like them to save taxes like they did. Hell, many of even do it now, on a smaller scale, by buying something something, and showing something else, so that we could a save a few buck in tax.
  
TL:DR; They didn't steal my money, so who cares. I don't. Source of this information? Work and jumla are different things. Govts after govts have lacked motivation on acting against corruption.  Modi ji ended all the corruption in the country. What papers are you talking about? Simply disclosure of names in the Panama leaks is neither an admission of nor a complicity in breaking the law.

Framing charges isn't the default first step in the judicial process. It is preceded by investigation, surveillance and intelligence. So calm your misplaced justice boner.

What are my options?,37,7a8no5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7a8no5/what_are_my_options/,25,"So I read a post about a teen about his options if he went ahead to skip college and I wanted to know what options I got.

I am 23, undergrad in BBA in Finance and working in a family business for almost a year. I do not know if I am meant for the business and how the future for the business holds. 

But lets say, if I were to join the work force at the age of 30, what skills can I self-teach to make myself employable in the next 7-8 years? I mostly do door-to-door sales for my business, but not sure if I enjoy that. Programming, graphic design, AI, etc. what would you suggest? I am average at maths. 

I am not planning to get a masters degree. Will that hurt me in the future?

Also, on a side note, how can I become street smart? 

Thank you.",nosleepnomore," Honestly the job market wouldn't see you as a good candidate if you self educated yourself in something but have experience in something else. At least the big companies won't entertain your programming self studies or MOOCs if your past work experience of 8 years is not relevant. 

You could try putting every project, every course on github, making your skills as knowable as possible on blogs and/or YouTube. This would be my suggestion. Enter hackathons for programming, kaggle for AI, get your graphic designs up on display something like that. Anything noticeable. Programming like Java shouldn't be super tough to pick up initially. But of course the nuances are hard.

The thing is, the big companies trust other big companies to mould you similarly to how they want you. So if you're already moulded by another big company you're ready to start in theirs. If not... they don't really trust you and can't judge you well enough in interviews. It's risky for them.

People are opening up to MOOC degree based recruitment but it's not going to be easy OP. But good luck :) Didn't mean to put your spirits down but be prepared to work really hard at 30 to get a job. Does the family business make money or lose money? In what business are you involved ?

**Previous Threads:** [*State of the Week* wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/state_of_the_week)",anon_geek," One of the Best places from India. For a goan in Chennai it was as close as it get to being like Home. I visited Pondi last year. It's such a peaceful place. Everyone seems laid back.   

Chilling with people on the promenade along Rock Beach at 3 AM while both drunk and slightly stoned is one of the best experiences I've had.  Come visit us! Pondicherry is lovely this time of the Year!  Well planned roads, cheap booze, plenty of beaches, very close to Chennai, French grils ❤️ Moved out of Pondicherry a couple of years ago and this posts makes me miss home. Very peaceful to come visit. Especially right now. Go to the different beaches. Enjoy the architecture. Go to Auroville and smoke a blunt. Go to the Ashram and Matrimandir and get some peace. Take a bike and roam in the ""white town"" at 6 in the morning. And also, don't forget your alcohol.
Try out different restaurants in the evening and Nehru St and Mission St for all your shopping. If you are there on Sunday, do go to the Sunday Market on MG road. 

If you are driving, do fill up your tanks and also more in a storage. Cheapest rates IMO.

EDIT


Fun fact: When I mention white town, it is called the boulevard. The heart of Pondicherry. Was built by the French(duh). They have an amazing drainage system with two canals one going north-south and other east to west. The north South Canal also separates the white town from the regular town(The french were racists). The french lived in the white town next to the beach and the rest on the west. The french also constructed roads and all the east to west roads are parallel to each other and end at the beach. 
The regular town was also divided by the french based on religion. The north was full of Hindus and that is where you will find the old temples. The south was Christians. You will find beautiful churches and missionary schools. The South east was Muslims. Their roads are the unique roads in pondicherry where they don't end up in the beach but are diagonal and face the Mecca. There is a Pondicherry Arch at all the three borders when you enter Pondicherry. And also, two clock towers at the focii of the boulevard. Oh forgot to mention it is in the form of an [ellipse](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Puducherry/@11.9322492,79.8217652,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3a5361ab8e49cfcf:0xcc6bd326d2f0b04e!8m2!3d11.9138598!4d79.8144722). A lot of people in Chennai use Puducherry as a weekend getaway to binge but Puducherry has so much more to offer. There is some charm in taking a walk on those cobbled streets, going to Auroville  or Matrimandir.I have spent a lot of Sundays on those beaches reading a book. I used to finish entire novels there. In the evening, go to one of those restaurants and eat a sumptuous meal with a beer. Le Club was absolutely amazing. An evening walk on the beach with a  bit of sweat dripping from your head which the wind tries to soothe.

Thank you for the memories Puducherry and thank you for providing a much needed quick escape from the chaos of corporate life. Also, you get to see French chicks in salwars. I don't know the intricacies, but the desi cloth definitely makes them 10/10s.  How's Kiran Bedi's performance till date? Also, these places come under Puducherry UT:

Famous for its songs and being a brood parasite.  
One of the common misconceptions is the female koel makes the melodious calls, whereas it's actually the male koel which ""sings"".

[Oriental Bird Images](http://orientalbirdimages.org/search.php?Bird_ID=425) The map of Pudducherry is weird .. a mad collection of exclaves ! How much French cultural influence is there in the local population. Is there anyone at all who speaks primarily in French?  Go to airbnb and book Thomas Kutty's (i think that was the name, or maybe I just made up a mallu sounding name trying to remember it..) homestay. Loved that place,hope it's still there. It's a small fisherman's house ON the beach converted into a homestay, with an open terrace that also has a kitchen. Visit the white town, go to the ashram if you're inclined to it, have some good dinner and cocktails at quaint hipsterish pubs and cafes, go to the proper town, buy cheap and great quality booze, carry other requisites (blunts, mosquito coil, camera to capture moon and sun rise and the occasional surfers and beach stunt boys in the morning). Eat some fresh fish. Live life. Do all this in any particular order. But most importantly,

DEFINITELY DRINK WAREHOUSE TEQUILA.  It's a local tequila you get there that is brutal.

Pondy has got something for all, cool scenes, ashrams and temples, commune living, cheap liquor, friendly people, great beaches, good shopping, great food, colonial and cultural places. And it's easy to access. Visited Puducherry in last Onam holidays. Hip place. 10/10.  Great place. Great beaches. Great booze. Well planned city. 

Also, if anyone visits, there is a place where the fishermen take you to the middle of the ocean and drop you in for and hour or so. Definitely try that. 

I heard there is scuba diving and such but haven't tried.  Baker Street and Cafe Xtasi FTW ! I really wish the architects and planners of the city had used some of the block planning from the French part of the city throughout the rest of the town as well. It's a great place but can be so much better. One more tidbit: 

Pondicherry has 9 medical colleges, 7 in Puducherry itself, probably the densest collection of medical colleges in all of India. 

:: Thanks, /user/Aaron_Ramasamy Also, [Chandernagore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandannagar), now a municipal corporation in West Bengal, near Kolkata was a territory (enclave) of Pondicherry UT which had to be given up &  merged into W.Bengal due to distance and impracticality of administration.  Visited Pondicherry long time back and it was like this chilled out place somewhere  Ok couple of questions:

1. What is the best time to visit w/o burning your skin?
2. For someone vegetarian, non-smoker,teetotaller, what to do here? Le café , so many memories!  I live 10km from Pondicherry across the border in TN and thanks for the cheap petrol and drinks over the years. Visited Pondi few years back. Had an amazing time. Paradise beach, main beach, Aurbindo ashrams, beer brewery (from gate), Matrimandir all were fantastic. Couldn't get into beer brewery as we didn't know we could schedule our visit a day before.  
Loved it. :) Thanks for the memories.   
Po Pondy!!  [deleted] One of the cleanest place you could witness within tamilnadu will be obviously puducherry.... What language do the commoners speak? If a Northie Hindi/English speaker was to join JIPMER would he face any problem? On the border touching Pondy and Cuddalore, there is a bar called ""Kennedy"". The ambience was one of kind because most of the tables are in a coconut grove with the tables around the trees. And oh, they server Rat meat there or so the menu said. 

Anyway, great place. I was lucky as a friend of mine lived there.  Been here twice! I think this was the last vacation I've had! It's beautiful. The streets have such a comfy feel to it, man. Especially in the afternoon under the shades of the trees by the streets! The whole place has got a comfy vibe to it. I love it! :D What is the cheapest way to get to Puducherry from Bangalore using public transport (trains are already completely booked)? Am i the only one who thinks Puducheri should be a part of T.N already? its INSIDE T.N for crying out loud, its funny how we can easily divide states on an arbitrary basis(chhattisgarh,Telengana,uttarakhand,jharkhand) but can't actually unite any states. So I have heard of discriminating attitude there by other redditors, is this true? Wow - So Kiran Bedi was appointed Governor after she lost the Delhi election?  Holy crap!

Opportunity for crypto investors in India (subject to an assumption),5,8b6sq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8b6sq8/opportunity_for_crypto_investors_in_india_subject/,6,"In light of the ring fencing of banks by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its first monetary policy review of 2018-19, entities regulated by RBI shall, with immediate effect, not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Banks & other financial institutions which are already providing such services have been given a window of **3 months** to terminate these services.

Even though the exchanges & crypto community in India are seeking remedial action against RBI's diktat, I am not very hopeful that we'll be able to get a stay order from the Supreme Court of India in favour of crypto-currencies. The primary reason for my skepticism being the *little to no understanding of the crypto world that Indian government possesses.* It's noteworthy and depressing at the same time that Finance Minister of India [compared cryptocurrencies to ponzi schemes late last year.](https://qz.com/1171183/bitcoin-is-neither-legal-nor-illegal-in-india-and-everyones-confused/)

Not many users out here know that [Indian crypto markets crashed flat 25-30%](http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/with-rbi-s-near-ban-announcement-cryptocurrency-prices-crash-sharply-118040501410_1.html) in less than an hour of RBI notification on **April 5, 2018** because of panic selling by investors whereas the foreign exchanges didn't show any substantial fluctuations because of the same.

This decline in value is sure to repeat at the end of the 3 months window (keeping in mind the **assumption** that RBI's decision holds at the end of these 3 months) with a greater percentage fall this time because investors will not be able to convert their fiat to crypto anymore in India for the immediate future. Personally, I won't be much surprised if XRP value comes down to 0.05$-0.10$ at that time. Without any exception, same shall be the fate of other VCs too.

So, the opportunity lies for those who have accounts with foreign banks since they shall be able to procure cryptocurrencies at dirt cheap prices here in India and be able to sell them abroad at the normal prices prevailing in world markets. This shall be beneficial for both categories of people, those looking to profit out of arbitrage and those intending to HODL them. I admit this post benefits only some investors based on their geographical presence and not the cryptoverse at large but one should make the most of what she/he has. *When life throws rocks at you, build a fort out of them.* ;)

Indian banking system under attack!,169,589exo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/589exo/indian_banking_system_under_attack/,84,"I have a strong reason to believe that Indian banking is under systematic attack. The shit hole goes very deep and the problem is compounded by the fact that the media ""tones"" down its coverage (obviously to avoid panic). There are malware attacks (on ICICI which is siphoning of email contacts and sending its account holders phishing emails), Advanced persistent threats on Axis Bank (they disclosed this to RBI), ATM frauds as in State Bank of India and multiple accounts of phishing attacks on individuals. Union Bank has also suffered cyber heist. 

A worrying trend is by use of SIM Swap. Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp), your details through identity thefts and blocking your actual SIM's so that you cannot receive the SMS alerts. 

Two factor authentication is very basic (dependent on passwords alone) which again can be easily retrieved because most users re-use their passwords. 

Its getting scarier and worsened. 


A simple remedy as of now is to change PIN of your existing debit card and get ""CHIP and PIN"" card which secures transaction because they cannot be replicated easily. Of course, moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised. 

Edit 1: In response to ""proofs"" and so called ""click bait""; here are the links. Please connect the dots. 
Further, BBM and Threema allow you to be anonymous because outside the system, they can't do anything to your PINS. :-)

I think it's objective proof enough. ICICI bank seems to have been affected with malware. Yes Bank, I think was also affected but I cant find the source. 

The worst? National Payments Corporation of India being affected but they of course denied it. 
http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/npci-denies-data-hack-says-systems-fully-secure/371544/ 

So there. There is no concept of security audits; if its there, it's useless. Basically, I feel its a bunch of monkeys sitting over out hard earned money and clueless on how things are getting worse. I wish I could use stronger profanity! ",blackberry_rad," True Caller is a bigger threat to your identity than Whats App, i can easily get your Email ID and FB profile without your consent if any of your friends have them linked to your contact details.... [removed] >Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp)

How? Do they hack Whatsapp or whatsapp willingly just hand over user data(which is bread and butter of FB) to any wannabe ?

For reference - https://www.eff.org/node/82654

 I work in a company which  has largest market share in banking software. These products assist banks to maintain security, DB, financial rules like BASEL and many other things.I work in RDBMS and big data maintenance along with cloud encryption. So, let me tell you a thing or two on how this system works.

First of all, simply by knowing your phone number using whatsapp will not be sufficient to hack a bank. It's like throwing a pebble on a lion at some kung-fu nerve and hoping to kill it. It's ridiculous so I will not even justify discussing this here because it's not quora and assume people over here to just use their logic a little. 

Now let us assume discussion is about hacking an individual's bank account, phishing is the most reliable way to do it. But be always aware to check if the website you have opened is https or not. It is a very basic thing. **NEVER OPEN LINKS USING YOUR MAIL ACCOUNT.** Phishing basically fools you to think that you are logging in to a bank but it is a private page of a hacker and you are basically texting him your password by typing over there. Now any hacker can easily deceive google security by making a hash code which he can crack easily so you wouldn't be notified by google too that this page is a security risk. Then there are other ways too. OTPs come on your phone and in more than a few cases, locked phones prompts the message on screen and OTP can be seen from that screen. This wouldn't be hacking but more like theft. **This btw is the best and to my knowledge the only way to hack into your friend's facebook account**. There are other ways too but phishing is the most common. It is like a king's pawn opening with many varities of its own. Usually a hacker develops his own way to phish but in 99% of the cases that involves sending you a mail and you opening a link through it or using your intranet or VPN to deceive the router.

>Indian banking system under attack!

This headline though is not about individual attacks on users but about an attack on a bank itself i.e. injecting your malware in their servers to redirect you to phishing or anywhere from bank's servers directly. It is very much possible for high end hackers but they will be caught by the system easily. One of my company's software provide three layers of security after authentication which is almost impossible to break. Other products provide microservices to enhance security over different modules. Banks hire other firms solely to enhance security and have their own departments to enhance it even more. Banks have multiple servers and their multiple back ups in multiple locations through which data traverse while your authentication happens. So physically hacking a server may get you past first layer but not other layers. Now using cyber attacks to go past all the servers is very very very tough. It's like landing on moon tough. ~~Countries who have that capability can do that~~ Then again, their are people with advanced brains and skills who dream of owning an island so theoretically they also might do it.  But a malware which redirects you to a different webpage through a bank's server is also possible but would be detected in milliseconds. Such a malware can remain in system to attack for that 1 millisecond for a few times but then again transactions are extremely hard to do even after knowing your passwords because banks detects IP jumps, have OTP verification process, have card grids any many other ways to ensure transaction is done by you and not by someone else.

TL;DR  : Even if someone puts a malware in a bank which is **extremely tough** and that easily detectable, he might get an idea of your bank balance but he can't do transactions. These are mostly rumors to shake stock markets by targeting those non-technical, superstitious and no chicken on Tuesday stock dealers.

Knowledge nugget: Start using Kali linux if you feel like hacking into your friend's computers and using their webcams and microphones. Start with creating word document with a listener and mailing it to your friend and ensuring that he opens the attachment. You will start making your own ways once you get addicted to it. Edit: OP has made some effort to actually try and substantiate his position, while several other comment threads are on random threats you can face online.

Firstly to OP, good on you for focus. 

As to why this doesnt count as proof - 

Articles 1 and 2, both link to articles on the same phishing attacks being targeted at ICICI users 

Article 3, talks about 

> India's third-largest private-sector bank Axis Bank   has appointed auditing firm EY to probe a cyber attack that came to its notice last month, a report in the Economic Times  says.

> The ET report said Axis was contacted by an engineer from Moscow-based Kaspersky anti-virus firm who told the bank that he had discovered a bug in Axis' systems while carrying out a separate probe. The bank has filed a report with the Reserve Bank of India appraising it of the situation. 

Firstly, if you are bringing E&Y to check your code... well, now you have 2 problems. (3, KASPERSKY has gotten in touch with you, and someone decides to go with E&Y? Wtf?)

There is something more material in that article here: 
>In June this year, the Reserve Bank of India had formulated a comprehensive policy that it wants banks to roll out. The guidelines outline an indicative set of baseline cyber security and resilience requirements,  steps to set up a ""cyber security operation centre"" and a template for reporting incidents to the central bank

But again, this is not proof that there is an Attack on the Indian banking system. Suggestive, but also business as normal for people to create and implement policy and security improvements.

Article 4 - 
> Public sector Union Bank of India on Friday said one of the bank’s offshore accounts was breached in a cyber attack but the money trail was traced and movement of funds was blocked.

Again, the fact that banks are targeted is not new. If there were multiple attempts to physically rob banks we would say theres a *spree* of bank robberies. Not that there is an attack on the banking system. You would have to prove that all these attacks are linked and designed to damage/bring down the Indian banking system.


Finally - theres 2 articles on security breaches. Sadly they happen. But again, bad net sec does not an attack make.


Again, extraordinary claims, extraordinary proof. You have to show that there is a sustained, organized and directed attack on the Indian Banking system. Not that Indian banks have still to improve their security.

 
------------
Wth?

Dude, proof or gtfo. For this to be an issue you would need to have a fraudulent transaction rate Increase across all banks.

This is something checked on a daily basis and if there was a rise or a spike, it would be an issue discussed or raised elsewhere.

You are making an implicit accusation and an explicit one.

1) Indian banking system is under attack

2) since it is being attacked and no one is aware about it, people checking errors and fraud are either zombies or sweeping it under the rug or are not bringing it to the authorities 

Either claim is extraordinary and for extraordinary claims there needs to be extraordinary proof.

Provide the proof.

  Seems like a forwarded WhatsApp spam message.
 Awareness about skimmers, Phishing, Vishing is the key. End user is too naive to understand this. As a security professional I took it as my personal responsibility to make my friends & family members aware about secure practices while using cards offline or online, while using social media & while browsing internet & about how to identify & avoid suspicious emails. Chip + PIN is not entirely safe. I posted here few weeks back about an incident where ₹ 20k were withdrawn from my account using a debit card at an ATM in a different city whereas the card was with me all the time. Luckily the bank (HDFC) credited the amount back in around 3 weeks, which is great but not sure if every other bank does it. To add when this happened, a bank official told me this has been happening with many people of late so I think some fuck up has happened with our banking system. Only option is to use cash now or keep your account balance low till it gets better, which I don't know how or when is gonna get.  Its actually not that hard to prevent you from reading smses from banks. You dont even need to fake an ID to do that

You can get an sms bomber for as cheap as 5 dollars and Call bomber for 10 dollars.

Point being, If a fraudster already has your bank details there is very little you can do to protect yourself. So get yourself the chip + pin cards like op says to better protect yourself. Source? As a security engineer I would like to spend extra million dollars to put few cisco NAC appliances next to firewall. Also will be strict allowing thumb drives on any bank peripherals. 

I wil put all windows xp machines behind secondary  firewall, they are very easy to hack in to while upgrading any windows servers that are still windiws 2000.

 ⁠⁠⁠I worked at EY briefly in their computer security division in the US some 14-15 years ago - they existed mainly to give a clean chit to the customer. They would bill heavily (my rate was like $600 an hour), make a big dog and pony show of conducting an audit, officially report only the most obvious mistakes, and work with the customer to ensure their public image was well managed. 

I quit working there mainly because of the huge gap between my ethical expectations and theirs.

The same EY is now auditing Axis. Kek. Dude listen, many of us here are tenured cyber security professionals from various industries. This happens all the time. The links that you have shared are aping each other because some company that sells some product or services related to the security domain has decided to make noise about these happenings and fix up a few presales calls with the bankers. 
The articles don't talk about how often these things happen or how many findings and incidents are under remediation as we type..


We saw a similar global buzz of articles when Fireeye used the Target breach for publicity a few years ago...
You still see them appear now and then in the media trying to make noise about breaches by APTs of state actors and China in particular. 


This wave is local to India. All I can say is Indian banking industry stays compliant to RBIs guidelines for information security as a guidance. They are loosely based on ISO 27k. There are frequent notifications from RBI related to new risks and threats that should be acted upon. 


There are industry specific threats and malware and the controls in place usually keep any major incidents from occurring. IT risk forms an important part of the Basel 3 standard too and measuring and managing the risks is a well oiled component. The risk exposure of a bank decides the capital needed as collateral to be kept with the RBI to offset any issues. None of these breaches are big enough to cause a major impact on the health of these banks.


We have a new Governor at the RBI signing notes. At the most, this collation of incidents into a bouquet could be an attempt to spook him into issuing a notification could benefit a certain group of vendors... don't read too much into it.
 It happens all the time. Everywhere. Banks are common targets. 

Unless you know and can tell us something groundbreaking, this sounds like WhatsApp forward I fear the botnet so I always register at places with a number different from the one registered with the bank. Is this a concerted attack over the last few days and do we have reason to believe that *Neighborly State Actors* could be directing this ? Lol, its so easy to hack a bank. Tons of branches especially of SBI, Canara are still using Windows XP machines, un-updated, un-patched and probably using a pirated version. You could load up a malware in pendrive, do some stupid social engineering to get them to insert your pendrive and you're done. Ohh, and I think they're still using IE6 or something. My Citibank credit card was skimmed and 48000 INR was withdrawn and that's the max limit for cash withdrawal. Fortunately I am in a different country with the card in hand with me and skimmed card was used in India. I was able to provide all the proof that I am out of country and prove that I have the card and Citibank might credit the amount back.

It was Chip and Pin card and yet it's not secure. Nothing is fraud proof. 

Some tips :
Never be lazy shout out the pin number at fuel or hotel places. It takes a minute to walk out of the car or your seat to insert the card yourself and enter the pin. 

Put a tape on the number and better to memorize Not trying to call this a clickbait or anything, but there is no need to push that red panic button either. One thing to remember is that if you take care of basic things like not sharing your passwords or any personal info with anyone, no harm can usually befall upon you.

And sorry, I don't think that the people guarding our financial systems are clueless. Had that been the case, there would have been panic everywhere - you and me would not be doing e-commerce transactions on flipkart in a relaxed manner, and people would still be carrying nothing but cash and gold bullion on them.

Such untoward incidents do happen sometimes, but there are so many checks and balances in the economy that the person doing such frauds are easily caught within days, it doesn't pay to do this for long term. >> moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised.

Can you explain? I was at a ATM yesterday and this guy came to me and asked if I have credit card, although I don't I told him I do just to make him go away. Then he asked me my name and phone number. I gave him my phone number. Can I be in trouble?  http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-banks-on-guard-after-data-security-breach-at-private-lender-1476576 The ideal solution would be to withdraw all of the amount or transfer it to a non-indian bank, right?

#But wait... the Bill says 'Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services'. How are they allowed to do these *other* things?
___

There has been a lot of debate for years about the Aadhaar card. On March 16, Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 was passed as a money bill. During the debate, our finance minister said time and again that the Aadhaar cards will be used specifically for providing subsidies and other financial benefits. He *said* it, but if anyone had bothered to take a peek into the proposed bill, they would have understood what was going on. 

But alas, the bill was brought on a Friday, our representatives had to fly back home. It's [""Take out the Trash"" day](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4l3qup/how_pleb_mps_try_to_impose_their_will_and_fail/)! So, meh.

*For a detailed analysis of what the Aadhaar Bill contains and why it was passed a s money bill, [read this](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking)*

**Changing the bill *after* it becomes an Act**

Aye. That can be done. 

There is a whole **Clause 54** left lying around titled ""Power of Authority to make Regulations"" in the [passed Aadhaar Act, 2016](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/168717.pdf). This particular clause lets the government change multiple aspects of the bill by issuing notifications. These notifications are then supposed to be laid formally in both houses of Parliament once the next session begins.

[Clause 54: Regulations rock peepal!](http://imgur.com/A5DXwmx)

[MOAR REGULATIONS!](http://imgur.com/q5hLCrm)


Look at these particular subsections. The government can change provisions for any of these *without the prior approval of Parliament*:

- [Biometric Information](http://imgur.com/i4lD5oS)

- [Other purposes](http://imgur.com/wqW7aPQ)

- [Other tech safeguards](http://imgur.com/xrJZpCO)

- [Maintaining, updating and deletion of Aadhaar numbers](http://imgur.com/3xhjdhm)

All of these subsections are so bloody vague that they can cover anything that a citizen does. What the heck does ""other purposes"" even mean?!

I have never seen anyone in Parliament challenging a notification. Many Acts are slyly changed in this manner. Please note (before you start outraging about how evil the present government is), this phenomenon is not something that was started by the Modi government, all governments in the past have been doing it in one way or the other. By keeping the wordings vague in the proposed bill itself, it gives a leeway for the executive to change it at a later date without consulting Parliament.

But... this has to stop somewhere, right? RIGHT?

___
#What can we do about it now?
___
Well, nothing, I’m afraid. I just wanted to put it out there. The only public intervention possible was *before* the Bill became an Act.  

Unless the [Supreme Court strikes down the Aadhaar Act’s validity](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4g34n7/an_important_supreme_court_hearing_is_coming_up/) or says it’s an invasion of the fundamental right to privacy, the public can’t do anything about it except watch & get Aadhaar cards in the process. 

If the SC *does* strike the Act down, I’m afraid it might be too late. The government is already on an overdrive to get maximum Aadhaar registrations. They are claiming that more than a billion people are now registered, even Aanganwaadis and Government hospitals are doing daily drives to get newborns registered.


I will end with a quote by a wise fictional one eyed man called Alastor “Mad Eye” Moody:

#“CONSTANT VIGILANCE!”

Fin.

EDIT: Added a link to a detailed post on the Aadhaar Bill and its various provisions.",kumbhakaran," I don't like where this is going. A biometric way of identification should be implemented to protect one's identity, not be given to MNCs who can invent ways to isolate people based on their unique identification. 

Why are bills and laws being passed with vague terminology and wording? The largest democracy in the world is proving to be the most retarded democracy in protecting its own people and their interests. 

Even after such loopholes are discovered and exposed, the Supreme Court is just sitting on its ass and not doing anything to correct the flawed system. If such an attitude is displayed by the highest authority of the country, why do we even respect the institution named ""Supreme Court""??!! To be more precise, what respect does the Supreme Court exhibit towards the common man??? I used to be one of the ""meh, why such a ruckus about Aadhar's biometrics"", but I must say, this shit is truly scary now. Orwellian seems to be the word.

Stuff like Iris enabled tabs are still in their early stages and cost might be a factor, but a decade from now, a govt could do whatever it wants with this.

Also that rule about FIR's is fucking silly. Assume I get mugged, how in fuck am I supposed to remember my Aadhar card number? Retarded shit. Do we have Right to Privacy though? 

Article 21 says : No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.

Any lawyers who can clear up please? Most people here have not deciphered the government's game plan on Aadhar. Basically, it wants to side step and push until one can get it via underhanded tactics. So, technically it might not be required but they will push it as they know courts have a high turn around time. By then, they would have achieved their REAL objective - mass collection of  data.
 [deleted] awesome writeup. govt is trying their best to shove aadhar down our throats. looks like soon i'm going to be deprived of basic amenities because i lack Aadhar card (proliferation in Bengal is not much still) I did not want to make aadhar account. But then I was forced to because my new employer, an US based MNC, made it mandatory.

Is it legal for foreign based companies to ask for you aadhar card? I am not able to wrap my head around this issue, so guys help me here please. 

**Identification** - OP and others have given examples of Aadhaar being required for authentication and identification in various scenarios. Things like, FIR, Attendance, Skype calls with Govt, deliverance of government services and subsidies etc. 

At the basic level we all know for a fact that identification is required for all these things. 

Now why is Aadhar number & card (as a proof od identity and residence) worse than pan-card, license, passport, ration-card, electricity-bill, phone-bill, bpl card, bank statement etc? 

If just one single card/identification-proof works for most-things (where we need identification/authentication) why is it bad?

Is it an issue with us being **forced**? Like there is no compulsion to own/have any of the identifications like pan-card etc, I mentioned above, but we are indirectly being pushed to have Aadhar cards? 

But there again for various stuff we have been forced to get these cards. Like a pan-card is not compulsory in theory but becomes so when you start earning. Or a passport, license, ration-card under different circumstances. 

**Biometrics** - It eases the authorization/identification and reduces the chances of frauds and scams. mobile banking transactions might actually become more secure with these. 

**Misuse**- This is a concern which is very valid. But how and under what circumstances? Are we looking at real threats or just far-fetched fiction?

**Methodologies adopted by the govt** - As the OP mentioned that the way Aadhar Bill was passed and there is clause which can enable the govt to make changes aren't really kocher. However, aren't we mixing up the two things. What's done and how it got done are two different subjects. Wrong way does not make Aadhar itself wrong. 

Happy to change my opinion. Is there an NGO where I can donate which would fight against Aadhaar in Supreme Court? I will not take Aadhaar unless the SC says there is no way out. > other purposes

> other technology safeguards

So, I bothered checking out section 23.

Subsection 1 puts execution of process of issue completely in the ""authority's"" hands.

Clause (t) of subsection 2 goes like this --
>(t) such other powers and functions as may be prescribed.

Are you fucking kidding me? So the existing govt can do whatever the hell it wants with UID data.

All hell breaks loose if something open to interpretation like ""other"" creeps into contract or tender documents. Too bad we don't subject legislative bills to same standards. will resists getting this card as much as posible, lets see how long we can survive Let's just wait till the database get hacked, as some self-important Babu was too self-important and missed the deadline to submit two notorized copies of the form for updating the OS and anti spyware on the servers for better protection, and the Parliamentary Appropriations Subcommittee for Software Services to Adhar and Other Purposes doesn't retroactively allow any software updates until the next budget cycle.  How well is our database secured and who is privy to this information is the big question.  Such a complicated situation. If this was in the hands of a more unbiased government (like uh... uh...) I'd feel safer. This + smart city initiative is really panning out to be an Orwellian landscape. I can't tell if it's just the usual tech paranoia of things changing rapidly and people remaining as good/bad as they already are, or the possibility of an intense dictatorship.

Good thing the Indian govt is shitty at execution! Adhaar ~ ""Aam aadmi ka adhikaar"" my ass. The ""wild wild west"" days of technology are over. It is slowly being institutionalized using Aadhaar and other means. IMO this was a predictable step in the trend of adoption of modern tools for progress of the country.

You may call it a trojan but I say this is the govt's equivalent to a google/facebook tracking cookie. To serve the best interests of all participants, Aadhar needs to be omniscient and omnipresent. I am glad that Aadhar is the defacto identification system. If the Govt makes it the only number or identification required that would be even better.                  
Privacy is a boogeyman argument. Some institution has to have a list of people who are Indians or living in India,  which is obviously the government.  If anyone wants to transact with the government or society needs to have an identification.  That's the basic requirement.  I suppose it is free and doesn't require renewal or running around to get one.           
It is a good approach to prototype in small areas of government schemes before widening it further. Provides opportunities for scaling and error corrections. Nothing sneaky about it.         
It is entirely voluntary as well. There is no forced drive to enrol anyone.           
Only issue with Aadhar is they could have made it into citizenship proof.         
Glad to see there are technical progress into making Aadhar compatible tablets and mobiles.           
Very good initiative. Why there is no PIL in the Supreme Court? Ah, not-again the conspiracy theorists & luddites !

Look, lets get 2 things straight - which you probably would agree with too

1) To improve efficiency & governance, it helps a lot if every citizen has a unique ID.

2) NO system can be risk free, there will always be ways to break it. The best the architects can do, is to make the breaches difficult


Now, if you agree with #1, then you need to accept #2 as acceptable risk.

If you disagree with #1, then you probably don't understand how e-governance works. If you want to know what real constant surveillance is then open your Google dashboard. Locations, voice search, market targeting and now there is this ""ok Google""  the phone is constantly listening.  I bet NSA has a back door to everything.  Providing Adhar as a proof gives immediate results, try doing it for your next sim card.
If not doing any illegal things, then why worry about privacy. The data ending up in wrong hands is only valid worry, and is called a breach. Irctc having a breach turned out fake. Sure govt has a full proof contract with data management provider. Your freedom and your privacy is not because of lack of technology. It's because we the people have decided to govern ourselves this way. 

You have more power than you realize and the government has less than you think. Stop thinking of the Indian state as an Orwellian entity. It isn't and if it becomes, the blame can only be on us. Aadhaar would have no hand in that.",Business/Finance,2016-06-16 13:02:03
What does r/India think of Bitcoin? India must act now or miss out on this emerging technology.,40,6f3v9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6f3v9z/what_does_rindia_think_of_bitcoin_india_must_act/,29,"Bitcoin currently has grown so much in size that its market cap is bigger than any of USA's top airlines. Yes, these are Airlines like Delta with hundred's and hundreds of Boeing airplanes in their fleet connecting every city of America yet a simple technology run on a computer has usurped all these airlines. No mean feat. 

Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming. 

Meanwhile Indian Gov is actively trying to play down BTC, some ministers are still calling it scam, play of the devil, likening it with ""chit funds"" etc. What the fuck is wrong with the finance brains and the IT brains of our country that we (as a country) are missing out on the biggest IT development since world wide web thanks to illiterates talking their talk. 

And Im not talking about middle men like ""Zebpay"" and ""Unocoin"" - Bitcoin was invented to cut these middlemen out of the chain, yet these are the ones who are profiting selling BTC to Indians at a 25% markup price and taking a hefty commission. 

We are also giving a big play to more middle men companies like PayTM who are trying to reinvent the currency wheel and are doing such a bad job at it, yet most Indians will tell you that PAYTM is the best and Bitcoin is a scam. Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them - yet PAYTM is such a big rage here - outdated technology, very poor profitablity, the PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm.


Make no mistake, India will follow the rest of the world eventually, as we always do, and end up accepting BTC in 2020, but by that time the world would have already moved on and derived the most out of bitcoin. Many businesses are already hedging their funds vs BTC or investing part of their profits into BTC and the growth of 2500% since 2015 will only make more companies turn to BTC. 

Im sure many smart Indians have already started to see the potential of BTC, lets use this thread to discuss the market in India. ",WishYouWereHear," You do know that Bitcoin cannot be regulated and a ban would only hamper the perceived sovereignty of INR.  No problem with bitcoin gaining popularity, but the reading the replies of OP here, it seems he created this post to shove his point of view up others asses rather than to listen to their point of views. Ok, I'll bite. 

> Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming.

Sure they have. But is it illegal in India or USA ? If tomorrow Amazon decides that it will accept payments in Gold , Bitcoins or any legal doohickeys , can they prosecute Amazon ? This is NOT a rhetorical question so please feel free to answer.


Plus why would I buy anything using a bitcoin today if as you say yourself "" ...will make you rich over time if you just put a $100 in there today"" ? 

Some people were not fortunate as you are today. They knew that in a year their Tulip could have fetched more than an entire country , but unfortunately they could not preserve it. We don't have that problems with BTC. So lets never use them till each BTC is worth a gazillion kabillion dollars.

> ...middle men like ""Zebpay"" and ""Unocoin"" ...

How in the fricking hell do you think an average Amit in India or an average Joe in Europe will be buying a BTC ? Do you fucking suppose that they will mine the BTC ? Have you ever heard of coindesk ? Exchanges ? Tumblers ? Are these being run as cooperatives ? Is Satoshi running these ?

> Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them

I suppose Paypal , and the newly introduced Google Wallets , Amazon pay , Samsung Pay, Apple Pay , Isis wallet are just barely hanging in there with NOBODY using them. Starbucks processing more than 8 million transactions each week on its own wallet is just an alternate fact , ain't it ! 

> PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm

Are there businesses which are NOT supposed to support the CEO and its shareholders to become a billionaire ?

If you feel that Paytm suffers from lack of basic communication , well , no one is forcing you to use it.

The fricking behemoths that are SBI , ICICI and HDFC are already investing into the blockchain tech.
RBI is all for it . Niti Aayog has been exploring it. 

But you still would go on that this is different from using the BTC because BTC is the snake oil that you are selling. Not the technology behind the snake oil !

Offtopic : The WannaCry ransomware was targeting people who still had XP or were using unpatched systems even after being warned by MS about the extra ordinary vulnerabilities. Now, the BTC is not something that is as easy as straightforward as opening a paypal or heck even an account in some despot-led tax haven country. 

I wonder if there were people ready to throw money at the hackers but could not understand the ABC of a BTC !


Another Offtopic : I read a book (or watched a documentary, can't remember) wherein some biologists and psychiatrists mentioned that the bubbles actually cause lunacy like symptoms. They did some fun studies to illustrate this and they took like brain scans as well. It was stupid enough that I dismissed it, but if anyone knows what I am talking about , please link me that book. call me old-school, I don't believe in bitcoins, investing in it is just nothing more than gambling. if few key players who owns the majority chunk of bitcoins will cash it out, it would never regain it's current market value, and that's just one possibility how it can go down, there are bazillion other possibilities that can cause the crash, meanwhile there is absolutely no assurance by any key economist, IMF, world bank that it's have any reliability and reason to stay. 

also there is a big myth that it bitcoins can be transferred instantaneously, in reality conformation of transaction take hours.

quite recently economist have published a very sensible article [""*What if bitcoin bubble bursts?*""](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21722841-latest-frenzy-tulip-mania-gold-rush-or-dotcom-boom-what-if-bitcoin-bubble), I suggest everyone to give it a read, and please do think thrice before 'investing' in bitcoins. Now is a really bad time to get into BTC.  
Heading for a crash very soon, wait for that. We discuss cryptocurrency every second day here. Here is the latest discussion - 
https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6ec6az/npwhy_arent_you/ If one is so sure about it's acceptance then the next logical step is to invest in it and make a windfall when it is finally accepted. I don't think they will ever understand the tech behind blockchains in public sector.. Atleast not until the govt jobs are taken by merit and not by reservations.. It will be interesting to see the financial system in India collapse if this blockchain's catch up.

Stay in an excellent job vs come back to live with my family?,30,65nu2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/65nu2c/stay_in_an_excellent_job_vs_come_back_to_live/,47,"I am in a very big dilemma right now. I have to choose between staying in my current job in Netherlands and become a wealthy man or going back to my own country and stay with my family(and not be so wealthy).

Background:

A bit of a background, I come from a south asian (pakistan,india,bangladesh) country where I lived with my family. I live with my mom, brother and little sister. I am 28 years old and not married. I am responsible for the finances of my house. So i pay for everything, including the college fee of my brother and sister and daily expenses such as food, electricity, rent etc. The college fee is done now as they are both in their last semester. Although, I will still be responsible for our daily expenses.

I recently went to the Netherlands and studied there for two years. I got a degree and even found a really nice job.

I have two options to choose from:

**Option 1: Stay at my current Job in Netherlands**

I have a really nice job in the Netherlands. There is such a big difference in the working conditions that I don't think I can work as a software engineer when I come back home.

My one month's salary in Netherlands is equal to my 3-4 months salary in my own country. In fact the difference in salary is so big that I dont think I can work as a software engineer when I go back home. It will just feel wrong to me to do the same type of work for 1/4th of the money.

Almost all companies treat you like a human in the Netherlands. They have really nice laws about employment law. I don't have to work overtime and even if I do work overtime, I will be paid for the overtime. This is not the case in my own country. In my country they expect you to work overtime and think you are not motivated if you refuse. And they will never pay you for overtime.

In the Netherlands you can be on sick leave for a maximum of two years and still get paid salary. Though it is not so common to be sick for so long but it is really comforting to know. In my country they start deducting your holidays when you are sick. And when all of your holidays are gone then they start deducting your salary. And if you dont show up after two months then there is a big chance you will be let go.

Besides my job, I have other benefits in the Netherlands. I have been on so many dates in the Netherlands which was not so easy in my country. Online dating is still non-existent in my country. I currently have a girlfriend in the Netherlands. I feel really free and independent in terms of dating. I can go to anyone's house and invite any girl in my own house I also have nice public transport, online shopping for almost all video games, books, clothes etc. I have a really nice gym. The only career i can think of having when I go back is do my own business.

While living in Netherlands has good points, there are also some bad things. There are some things that make me hate Netherlands sometimes. If I stay there for one year without a holiday then I get really miserable. I really miss my family on my holidays. I also feel that they sometimes look at us in a condescending way.I have had a lot of incidents related to racism. It seems like they feel like they are much better than us. I have been asked all sorts of questions like : Is there a tv in your country? Do you have internet in your country? Do you know what a washing machine is ? Sometimes people give me a look of disgust even. And they get more weird if they know I am a muslim. 
 
**Option 2: Go back to my home country and live with my family**

I mentioned a lot of really nice things in the first option but I really miss my family and my country's food. My mom is always very sad when my holidays are up and I have to go back. She is always crying when I leave. She said that I can stay in the Netherlands for as long as I want but she is happy when I am around. My little sister also misses me. She told me that I should come back next year. She is going to be married in a few years then I wont be able to see her so often. When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.

Regarding finances, i will have around 20k$ of savings by next year. What is your opinion?",aznten," Stay in nederdraad. Visit once twice a year. You won't regret long term.  It's at such times only that you have to decide your priorities in life, and develop and follow your principles. I personally believe in this - ""The quality of your life is the quality of your relationships"". A poor person can be quite happy if surrounded by people he loves. A very rich man will not be happy without loved ones.

That said, things are more complicated. Employment and infrastructure is bad in India. And it's not always that our family or relationships will be good. So you have to decide whether things are worth it.

One idea probably is to work in your prime years abroad, earn a shitload of money, marry a desi import or someone okay with moving to India, save your money, and return to India in time for your kids to go to college. And retire here. All the while visiting as much as you can, to keep in touch with family and also making arrangements for your future.

Or another one is to take the leap of faith, return to your motherland, try and work to do your bit to improve this country, and save your wife and kids the trauma of moving.

Staying there, you will always remain an outsider. And so will your kids, be them desi or mixed race. I wouldn't want that for my children. Family sticks when no one will. Your 'friends' and 'neighbours' won't take care of you when you're​ sick or grow old. I am in no way expert, but try to earn as much as possible there and then move back as the other guy said. Buy everything you need here while working there (car, house, maybe savings for marriage and kids) and then find a job here before moving back. It will be rough but smoothen it out with money.

Is there any possibility that your parents can fly over to Netherlands for maybe 2-3 months in-between for just traveling and will ease the homesickness while allowing them to also enjoy?

 Stay. With family it's ""door ki cheez sona, pass ki cheez chapal."" , your value diminishes as long as you be with your family. Catch 22.
Based on my experience, I still have not found any answer to this question.
But stay in ND till you find a way out. Seems your mind says Netherlands, but your heart says India. FWIW, the software industry in India has improved over the last few years. There is considerable foreign investment in the market right now and if you display your skills well, you can make comparable money. Also, years of interacting with the west and many NRIs coming back has resulted in some of that culture rubbing off. If you know where to look for, you will find places that value employee well being as a means to overall productivity. Keep away from the big four obviously. I think you should stay there. 
&nbsp;

You have mentioned that you can fly your mother there but there is no one to look after you siblings? But you also mentioned that your sibling(s) are about to graduate? I think they can manage staying alone for a couple of weeks. 
&nbsp;

Talk to them about it. And later, they can accompany your mum too! I'm not sure if I'm the right guy for this, but you should ask yourself instead of strangers. 100 people will give 100 different answers. Ultimately you are responsible for your own life. Don't leave NL or stay there just because 90% of the subreddit says so. Its your life and you alone should make the choice. Nobody here has any idea of your thoughts, beliefs, values etc. Personally I would quit my comforts to live with my family regardless of them giving me any bhaw or not. Its because I love them. I would do that. But that doesn't mean you should too. Flip a coin, while its in the air, the result you hope for is the correct choice. As for a personal opinion, money and good lifestyle can only get you so far. The ultimate thing is being happy inside. And if being with your family makes you happy, then by all means return to your country. It doesn't matter if you've got a villa, a swimming pool and a fuckload of money with 2 yr leave,if you're lonely. If you want to be with your family and it seems like you do take them there or move back home. Its all upto you. Good luck brother. Please do update someday what you did.  Come back to live with your family and make India progress with your incredible talent.  Could you not try and set up your own business from the Netherlands and when this runs well enough move it to India? Software engineering can be done anywhere? 
I am from the Netherlands, I adopted my daughter from India. Since politician Wilders is spouting his hatred she also has a harder time. I am not sure where this will end. Sometimes I fear that Muslims will be the new Jews in another 10 years or so. (My daughters biological parents were most likely Hindu, by the way) Visit often or get your family to Netherlands Stay there...build a good social circle and build a good life. Over time, try and move your family there.  IMO you should Come back only if you have a good plan. Regarding occupation, I've heard some of the start-up's here giving at-least some of the benefits you have mentioned, certainly not the two year sick leave but, your experience will be valued for sure. This post is a reason why I always vote for accepting bullying in adult social situation. You need a kick in the ass for a reality check, being pampered too much these days I see. Stop this drama, grow a pair and get ahead. You know everything you need to, stop trying to seek validation.  > When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.

from your post I think you need a wife. I'm sure you can get a maid to do cleaning, and order groceries online; where as your wife will cook you your own food.

you need to asses your situation yourself. why are you asking yourself this question. Is it for your comfort or to keep your mother/siblings happy. I see that you've mentioned that you are responsible for running your family. In that case, you could run your family from anywhere in the world as long as you are sure that there is someone you could trust locally that can act as you proxy, which in this case your brother.

your dilemma is that you want to go home, but you don't want to leave this lavish lifestyle you've become accustomed to. Also as an added bonus staying would give you more money for yourself and to run your family.

the real question is would be able to stay away from your family and see them for short intervals in a year. if yes, then stay. If you feel like you're missing the love of your family, and cannot bear the solitude then go back home. Are you the last of a dying breed?  Stay in Netherlands and get epic rich. Visit home atleast twice a year. This may happen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0dk9vx2yks Bhai, the answer is simple. Ask yourself, love berween your family members is more important or money? Your mother will add fewer  years than you, your sister will go to someone else after a few years and the MONEY, you can burn it in Netherlands if you are feeling cold. 

Sure we are a developing country and we have a hell lot of problems, but I cannot even think of ditching my parents to get 'comfortable' in a developed country. My parents struggled financially, emotionally to raise me, I can't turn my back on them. Whatever happens to them, I will stay with them. Money, that comes later. Love and happiness of my family members collectively is paramount. Get new family in Netherlands. Maybe 2 more families somewhere on the side.j/k

 Stay in Netherlands, continue to do your job. In your extra time research and try to start your business (DON'T QUIT YOUR JOB). 

If your business lifts off :

1. You'll have much more money for your family (think sister's marriage/ brother's education).
2. You can move your family there and settle down.
3. You can quit your job and run that business from India while earning money (and spending less).

If your business doesn't lift off :

1. This will help you find faults in your approach, so that you can refine your business model.
2. Keep working at your job, build more experience. Then apply to a bigger company for more salary.

Best of luck with life and such! Visit some night spots in Amsterdam.. have some magic cakes .. feel good .. enjoy the moment..  You asked in the wrong place, mate.

People on this subreddit are so desperate to escape India for some reason, they will immediately tell you to stay in Europe. WTF?This is such a stupid doubt to have .

Stay where you are especially if you are this happy,I mean seriously man? [removed]",Business/Finance,2017-04-16 14:23:01

AFAIK he is good friends with Raghu. And new enemy of my macro economics teacher is born. Patel is an excellent choice. I've followed the RBI statements in the last few months and you can just tell how much Rajan trusts him. He always comes across as very knowledgable and informed, while at the same time humble and zero arrogance.

I think this will be a very good pick. I doubt he'll do the bidding of what Modi and his team want, Patel is part of the system in RBI. He takes its independence *very* seriously.

 I was worried that amidst NPA crisis they will make Bhattacharya the Governor. I am happy that at least there is no conflict of interest. [Live Blog: Urjit Patel Named RBI Governor]

Our Banks are in trouble & we need to talk about it,422,47ogw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/47ogw5/our_banks_are_in_trouble_we_need_to_talk_about_it/,93,"Amidst the prolonged JNU controversy &amp; Jat Quota stir, one big development is constantly being ignored for the past two weeks. Our Banks (PSBs) have declared they have [4.4 lakh crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/at-rs-4-lakh-crore-bad-loans-exceed-market-value-of-psu-banks/articleshow/51078318.cms) worth Non Performing Assets (NPAs) as of December 2015. 

Here, I will attempt to break it all down in layman terms. What, why, when and how it affects us, the taxpayer. I'm no finance expert, so please point out any errors I make. I had to go through a lot of complicated jargon (it's weird how these things are always so complicated) to make sense of it.

**What are NPAs and why should we care?**

Loans whose three consecutive installments are not paid are classified as Non Performing Assets (NPAs). After an NPA or bad loan is declared, the bank can initiate the process of recovery and restructuring of that loan. It will try to get new management to run projects, auction off collateral and try to recover the amount, which is rarely equivalent to the amount of loan given. Especially in case of big loans. 

The NPAs that have been declared recently are mostly by big corporate borrowers (according to some sources, around 65-70% of total defaulters are big corps). Take the example of Vijay Mallaya. Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore. Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore. 

On top of it, [Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/budget/article-vijay-mallya-resigns-from-united-spirits-gets-rs-515-crore-1281435?pfrom=home-lateststories) and got a payout of ~~$515 million~~ Rs 515 crore. Good times for him while the 17 banks unitedly struggle to recover the loan amount. 

**So if the loans can't be recovered, what happens to the banks?** 

Simply put, they register losses, throw up their hands and tell the Government, ""Sorry [boss, can't get these loans back](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/state-run-banks-like-sbi-bank-of-baroda-central-bank-of-india-apprise-pm-narendra-modi-of-rising-bad-loans/articleshow/50990898.cms). We need to make profits. Pliss to help."" 

**What will the Government do about this?**

One word: Bailout. 
This whole thing is turning into a big cluster fuck. 'Sources' have been saying the government is planning to infuse Rs 70,000 crore till 2019 into PSBs to calm things down. They have already infused Rs 20,000 crore this year. This amount will not help banks deal with the problem in totality but it's a temporary measure to ensure they don't just collapse under the weight of NPAs. 

**Does that Government have enough money to save the banks?**

No. 

Here's a few things which the government has to spend on in the near future:

1) [Food Security Act](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-03/news/70313785_1_national-food-security-act-prime-minister-narendra-modi-food-subsidy) 

2) [MGNREGA](http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2016/02/nda-pursuing-mgnrega-bengal-and-up-election/)

3) [Seventh pay commission](http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/of-the-servants-by-the-servants-for-the-servants/)

5) [Increased Defence allocation](http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2016-17/expert-columns/defence-budget-allocation-likely-to-see-minimum-10-per-cent-hike/story/229336.html)

The revenue, on the other hand, doesn't seem that rosy. The government has [kept the fuel prices high](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/excise-duty-hiked-on-petrol-by-re-1litre-on-diesel-by-rs-1-5/) to get excise duty on it. The finance minister has been saying this is being done to reduce our fiscal deficit, which is fair. But then in that case where will the money for 'capital infusion in banks' come from? 

(I have to point out here that the first two expenditure items I mentioned are something that the present government has avoided spending on much till now. I don't blame them because the GST plan didn't really work out, so they have to go on an appeasement spree to calm their voters.)

**Well, that's all dandy well awesome but who's fault is it?**

This problem, unfortunately, cannot be pinned down on a single person or party. So I've made a list! 

1) *Raghuram Rajan / Reserve Bank of India*

The banks have been more or less forced to declare these loans because Raghuram Rajan sent notices telling them to clean up their balance sheets. He did this so that the banks can start a fresh cycle of loan disbursements to boost investment in the country. It's a good move in the long term but it all depends on whether the banks are in a position to handle the burden at this point of time.

A Supreme Court bench recently [pulled up the RBI to ask WTF is happening](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-debts-rbi-supreme-court-bank-defaulters/). 

&gt; The bench headed by Chief Justice asked, ""People are owing thousands of crore to the public banks… it is a big fraud. Top ten public sector banks have written off Rs 40,000 crore alone in 2015. It is all there in this Indian Express report. Public financial institutions are lending money despite knowing no returns. RBI is supposed to keep a watch on these banks. What are you doing about it?”

They asked RBI to submit a list of defaulters with loans over Rs 500 crore. To which the RBI replied:

&gt; “The required information is not available with us. Banks are required to report the bad loans on a consolidated basis.""

Personally, I find this response really strange because a periodic reporting of big loans is done to both the Finance Ministry and RBI. How can they ask the banks to ~~waive off~~ write-off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of who the big defaulters are? 

*2) Manmohan Singh / Previous UPA Government*

If anyone is to blame, it's them. These loans which are being declared NPAs have been given during their time. They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money, but they didn't. So they have left this huge crumbling mass of debt which is all coming out. Like pus from a wound. Ugh.

*3) Narendra Modi / Present NDA Government*

If this capital infusion a.k.a. bailout continues and the economy gets in trouble, the NDA government will be definitely blamed for it. The whole point is that they are now in power and they have to clean up the mess even if they want to blame the previous government for it. The people will not forgive the BJP for a major (possibly catastrophic) economic downturn, no matter who is responsible for it. 

Modi has projected himself, right from the beginning, as the savior of the economy. Now that the economy is facing a challenge, he can't afford to point fingers at UPA. But he will, he most definitely will. Rightfully so, but that won't help matters at all.

*4) Faceless, nameless / The Banks*

Aah yes. These frikkin Bankers. The biggest culprits are the bank managers who are responsible for due diligence before disbursing loans. If there is an NPA in a particular bank branch, the manager is held responsible for it. In case of big loans, the top management has to give approvals and they are also held responsible. 

Through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans. 

*5) Big Corporates*

The usual suspects. They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts. Just like Vijay Mallya did. They have, in the past decade or so, taken a lot of loans which are now proving to be bad assets for the banks. Even the Economic survey has pointed out that these [corporate debts are worrisome](http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/perspective/economic-survey-corporate-debts-consumer-spend-monsoons/story/229607.html). They have called it 'The Twin Balance Sheet Problem'... which makes no sense to me...

Some projects haven't taken off due to land acquisition issues, Infrastructure problems and environmental clearances. There is limited investment coming in from abroad. Therefore, the government was eager to push GST and all of these investment driving schemes for the past two years. Didn't really work out as they planned. Even if they manage to pave the way for these pending projects, the corporations are known to delay and milk them for maximum profits. (Eg: KG Basin, IGI Airport and many more.) 

**So what happens next? Also, TLDR.**

To put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.

EDIT: Forgot to add one more thing.

Indian Express reported the NPA problem first on [February 9, 2016](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-1140000000000-bad-debts-the-great-govt-bank-write-off/).

EDIT 2: Gold! Thank you kind stranger. ",kumbhakaran," awesome writeup! thank you for taking the time to make the jargon clear to us! While bad on paper - the current scenario is actually better than expected.

The fact that banks have bad loans is an ancient fact of life - these loans extend to many many places, from large firms to small farmers.

It was always expected that some government, would have to intervene ecentually to fix this. It's the NDA who has to handle it, and I fully expect them to handle it. The issue itself is resolved by the bureaucrats and the bankers, with the GoI firmly in the driving seat.

But the issue is always the release of bank funds as largesse. It's a mainstay of Indian politics, in one form or the other. One of the ""unspoken rules"" of the game so far.

The divestiture of PSUs, or stronger oversight/capital norms as a means to constrain loans will help. 

The clean up of banks will be a good thing, and it will allow for loan cycle to occur on the base of a healthy banking sector, which can handle any future negative shock.

Honestly, this is business as expected. It's good that people are upset, but being upset won't make a difference since this is essentially a cyclical feature of the larger economy and our banking/private network.

Rules which are followed, divestment, distance between center/politics and PSU management are the cure - and they've been the cure since the reform process started, but haven't been completed.
 I can add few points on The Banks. My Dad is a Chief Manager of a Public Sector Bank in a Municipal Town based in TN.

Branch Managers/Chief Managers don't like having NPAs on their books either. The problem stems from the Zonal Level. The Zonal Manager assigns quarterly/yearly loan targets to individual branches. Applications for larger (and possibly good) loans that are forwarded to the zonal managers sit on their desks for several weeks, the borrower usually moves on to a Private Bank. Now all that's left is smaller loan applications from shaky applicants, local politicians who wants to build schools/engineering colleges, and activists who would threaten to 'Write to the FM' (This happened a lot during the PC era).  The Zonal Management, despite being sloppy, still expects the Branch Managers to meet the targets. So BMs give the loan and hope it would not become a NPA before they get transferred, so that the live bomb is passed on to the new guy.
With a bit of negotiation with the auditing team and the zonal management, you can avoid declaring few loans as NPA for a bunch of quarters. 

Oh, and I don't even want to speak about the crazy ones that retire as Branch Managers. They go on a loaning spree. Thanks a lot. This is some major issue which no one seems to care about in media. I have been telling this to friends and family and actually no one really cares. 

What concerns me is the part where they might bail out these rich-ass people with public money. That will be unjust. These people have the means to pay back and yet they take advantage of out easy recovery norms.

Irony is banks wouldn't write-off agricultural or small loans as these people are easier to bully and that will result in farmer suicides.

But they are happy to go with all the loss because somewhere we have lenient norms and these wigwigs are the ones who control our economic policies.

Edit: **[The Hindu Editorial on this issue](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/no-bailout-with-taxpayer-money/article8241268.ece)**
 Loans being written off from the books or provisions being kept against bad debt doesn't mean that there won't be recovery. The whole Raghuram Rajan point in the opening post doesn't make sense. That would be like blaming a government which enforces accurate reporting of crimes for increase in crime statistics.

The lowly bank managers have little say in large loans. The decision for the biggest NPAs are taken at least at General Manager level (some even at Chairman level). One needs to investigate these bad loans, seize the assets of willful defaulters and charge the real decision-makers in bank.

The whole issue is that of bankers being browbeaten to give risky debt to industrialists with political connections and the said industrialists refusing to pay up because they know that they have the connections and the power to avoid being hit by any action taken by common bank bankers (different ones from those who gave them loans). Great writeup. Thanks.    
A question: Big corporates (say Vijay Mallya) take huge loans and then are not able to pay back and thus the write off. What does the law do here? Can't it catch the culprits and send them to jail? Or probably auction the properties that were kept as a guarantee while taking loan? I haven't heard of a bigshot (except Sahara) who is sent to Jail for not paying back the money.  Vijay Mallaya is a free man and they fucked up my credit score because i missed one payment on my education loans.

 yenna rascals i tell ya.  > On top of it, Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits and got a payout of $515 million.

Rs515cr not $million. Pedantic but couldn't resist because of my intermittent OCD. sorry. 

>How can they ask the banks to waive off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of how the big defaulters are?

The Banks know who are the borrowers and RBI does not, so this is not an issue. 

Secondly, the loans are not being waived (as in cancelled or forgiven/forgotten). That's a wrong and dangerous word to use in this context. 

The loans are being written off. What that means is, as you say earlier in you post, that once the borrower has failed to service the loan (willingly or due to the things he can't control) the banks write-off (called provisioning; could be partial or full) that in their P&L and Balance Sheet to show the true reflection of their own health (Rajan is pushing for aggressive approach, as you mention later in the post). That does not mean that the borrower walks away. The Banks continue to make efforts to recover the money (through notices, public-shaming, selling assets of borrower, change of management, restructuring, conversion into equity, court-cases, sale of loan to ARCs etc). If a loan (or part of that) has been written off by the bank, and the bank manages to recover it, the amount is written back and becomes a profit for that year. 

An interesting example here would be the business cycle of mid 90s-early 2000s. At that time also the banks faced huge defaults and were actually in a worse shape than today. But fortunately the global commodity prices shot through the roof and most of the bank clients turned around and Banks averted a disaster. Most borrowers were commodity companies at that time (steel, cement etc). 

This time this is not likely to happen. So the mess wouldn't clear itself up. 

> They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money,

Not only did they not take these measures they actually forced the Banks to lend to their *favored* borrowers. one of the biggest defaulter is Unitech, which people say is a Gandhi-family company (rumor; don't ask for source). JP group another big defaulter was close to BSP, Jindals to Congress, HCC to Pawar, DLF to Huda/Vadra and so on. 

> They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts.

If the government/banks play by the book (which is a big ask) they need not. Seize their fucking assets. If they have given a personal guarantee, seize their homes too. 

> So what happens next?

Short term- Government puts equity into the banks and they somehow survive

Medium term- Hopefully this Government puts professional management into the top layers of the bank (Board and CMD) and the rot is contained. It is happening in Bank Of Baroda but again a tall ask

Long term- The relative size of the PSU bank will shrink, pvt banks will become bigger. 

One last point. Why are politicians reluctant in reforming or privatizing the Banks? Because that is the biggest tool of granting favors to corporates who in turn are the biggest political donors. 

The last last point. There is a Silver lining, The bank's problem is a stock-problem i.e. the loans already given are going bad and we need to deal with it. What the system does not have, fortunately, is the 'flow' problem ie new money is coming into the system and if the investment cycle picks up, we will have the money to fund it.  Relevant Documentary: **[Overdose: The Next Financial Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ECi6WJpbzE)** It is really appreciated that we have people like you who are willing to be frank about such situations. >Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and **the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore.** Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore.

The reason why this happened is because Mallaya used the trademarks and labels of kingfisher as collateral with the banks. But the value of these trademarks crashed when kingfisher went bankrupt. Now this goes without saying that a brand name would lose its value if it goes bankrupt, so why did banks took the risk of taking kingfisher trademarks as collateral in the first place when the loan was being taken for the vary same corporation.


>The bench headed by Chief Justice asked,

>It is all there in this Indian Express report.

Well, that's strange!

Is supreme court bench drawing its conclusions from a newspaper's report?
 I always post this lecture/article by Rajan on the topic of attitude of borrowers towards the bank. www.outlookindia.com/article/we-need-a-change-in-mind-set/292696

> The average interest rate on loans to the power sector today is 13.7% even while the policy rate is 8%. The difference, also known as the credit risk premium, of 5.7% is largely compensation banks demand for the risk of default and non-payment. Since the unscrupulous promoter hides among the scrupulous ones, every businessperson is tainted by the bad eggs in the basket. Even comparing the rate on the power sector loan with the average rate available on the home loan of 10.7%, it is obvious that even good power sector firms are paying much more than the average household because of bank worries about whether they will recover loans. Reforms that lower this 300 basis point risk premium of power sector loans vis-a-vis home loans would have large beneficial effects on the cost of finance, perhaps as much or more than any monetary policy accommodation.

Also highlights general problems like regulatory forbearance which was put in place for temporary use but has been abused again and again. - www.livemint.com/Opinion/RbcTUBqQfY7MOqW4uyTQ7H/Why-regulatory-forbearance-must-end.html

Recovery rates of PSBs are lower than Private sector banks but the latter's isn't all that higher either (25%), we need better bankruptcy laws to deal with this. 

cc /u/kumbhakaran you may want to add these links if you find them useful/insightful. >Through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans

It is not possible for the manger to hide bad loans as periodical review of all the accounts is done. 

Many of the bad loans have till now been prevented from being classified as NPAs by refinancing them with short term loans to avoid defaults. The RBI has now asked them to classify even such loans as bad loans. Also under consortium lending even if one member bank recognizes an account as NPA, all the banks are now required to treat the account as NPA which was not the case earlier. Both of these are major causes for the higher NPA numbers

It is the top management which is responsible for the current mess and not just the front end manager who in most of the cases is just following orders from the top. two very improtant numbers are missing 

1)  when you say 4.4 lakh cores in Non Performing Assets (NPAs)...what is the total out standing loan amounts outstanding for all banks concerned...only then can we say what percentage of total loans are NPA's....i can see that 4.4 lakh cores seems like lot but it will not make any sense until we see what how much of the total loaned out amount are NPA's.....

2) also what are the total deposits help for all bank concerned?.......

when these two numbers are understood then this issue wont be as dire as it seems....

all banks world over has NPA's...its the nature if the business..as long as the overall loans are managed well then we will be okay Can some one shed some light of why lots of big corporations defaulting? Indian economy is doing very good. Some companies are doomed to fail,  but in good economic situation there should be more successful than failed ones.  Umm sir why should government cover for the banks? How about a radical idea: Get government out of banking, let the public banks fail if they have to.

Modi promised divestment and reducing the size of the government. Government acquiring the bad loans of banks is completely opposite. Hope he sticks to his principles and stated promises. Anyone know about this?

Big corporate companies & PSU's take loan from foreign banks based outside of India, because they have near-zero interest rates. It's basically called External Commercial Borrowings (ECB)

Does the issue of NPA's exist in ECB too?  If possible, have Mr Satpathy ask a question in the question hour to Mr. Finance Minister about how the government plans to deal with these NPAs and where that money will come out of. This is what Make in India initiative will be twisted for. Just pledging an investment for so and so money. 

Whether they have expertise in that field or they are company which is not running in losses or a company with a history of bad loans or whether they will actually follow thorough, won't be observed at all. 

They will strong arm the banks to provide loans which they will use for their own company purposes. 

Check who are the highest defaulters currently are: Essar, Reliance, Adani, Vedanta, GVK. 

You think they will pay it off? Not a chance, they will use make in India as leverage, investment as a collateral, and continue bleeding ~~banks~~ PSBs.  You are welcome
http://www.moneyreformsindia.org/ Excellent write up /u/kumbhakaran with great inputs from /u/ribiy, I highly appreciate these kind of informative posts. Great read boss. A very fine write up.

A majority of those loans are actually the **'infrastructure loans'** that the corporates(majority of them private ones) took, mostly from the PSBs and then because of one reason or another(land acquisition, environmental clearances, etc.) weren't able to earn enough and in time to pay back.

Now, as the interest that they are supposed to pay, changes(increases, usually) every year(*notwithstanding the fact that the corporates usually factor in the interest risk factor during the initial years of the start of the project but because such projects provide returns for some 30-40 years on an average - like tollbooths on the highways - its usually a risk that pays off eventually*), if the project is stalled, the interest starts piling up. Inflation and falling rupee worsen the impact. 

I read today - [304 plans worth Rs 12,75,877 crore stuck; stalled projects continue to haunt policymakers](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/304-plans-worth-rs-1275877-cr-stuck-stalled-projects-continue-to-haunt-policymakers/)

There are a few measures that the current government did take last year, both on the revenue and the expense sides. One I remember is [Indradhanush](http://currentaffairs.gktoday.in/union-government-unveils-indradhanush-mission-psbs-08201525782.html) which aims to introduce a bit of corporatism in the management(and consequentially affecting the processes of verification of claims, disbursement of funds and monitoring of paybacks) of the Public Sector Banks of the country which were behaving like they were throwing a *langar* in a gurudwara. 

An impending [Bankruptcy Law](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/market-outlook/india-staring-at-banking-crisis-bankruptcy-law-crucial-sanger_5410401.html) and [Debt Restructuring measures](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/c-p-chandrasekhar/saving-indias-public-sector-banks/article7392418.ece) might also help better the dire situation. Banks are not in trouble, our savings are in trouble.  > they have to clean up the mess

Modi can privatize the banks but the truth nobody has the balls to do it. Well now the fall in oil is a blessing in disguise for India. We don't have to print money to bail these banks out. Instead the govt is keeping the petrol prices high in part to pay for the subsidies provided when oil was upwards of $100/barrel and partly for the economic mess UPA1&2 left behind That's a very intelligent writing, but surprised to link Kingfisher Airline loss to Vijay Mallya. If he did some thing illegal like diverting funds from Kingfisher airlines to his personal accounts those kinds of activities are illegal and banks should go after his personal money. As a corporation setup he might have invested some of his money in it and some other individual's or corporation who got shares of the corporation.  Banks gave loan to that corporation betting on that success so banks could get portion of that success too. Some of those investmen's bound to fail just like any other investment and that's the risk they are taking. Banks are supposed to do honest evaluation of business model and management when they gave loan. 
 Shouldn't they consider more revenue from income tax and also implement drastic measures like cash transaction tax ( http://m.ndtv.com/profit/government-to-not-implement-banking-transaction-tax-712227) to bring more money into system ? What's the chance of my education loan being rejected?  OP, do you have information about a sector breakup of these NPA? If the exact names of the big defaulters are not known, is the statistics known?

I will also be interested in knowing how much of this NPA was loaned to GOI agencies like Air India. 

Edit: Thanks for the writeup. It's lucid. I know this first hand. One of my friends in SBI , a credit analyst objected to a big loan to a very poorly managed company.
But,eventually he got bullied by the sales teams and had to approve.
I remember that he got a silver ganesha worth at least 25k..the bank head got a golden ganesha as ""thank you gift""
The system is f***ed for good Good ELI5, but a few bad points.

1. Raghu is just as much to be blamed as the doctor that is operating on you now that you drunk so much that you crashed your bike on the street.

2. Manmohan and UPA are the biggest culprits since they forced the banks to give loans to corporate entities that were close to them (and likely Sonia and co were in on the take)

3. Supreme Court - When they do get a chance to pull the biggies down (looking at you, Sonia and Rahul in case of national Herald, or PC in case of Vasan Eyecare) - they pull the last punches, and thus feeding the ""too big to fail"" mindset.

4. Modi - Under Modi's term, the incremental borrowing has practically shrunk. They have no legislative control on the banks, as the banks report into the RBI from a regulatory standpoint. Bank appointees coming from Fin Secy is the only tangential link. Could Modi merge and privatize all these banks? Sure, that is something that I hope they do!

5. Big corporates - They are not to be blamed. They are sucking the system dry since they are being allowed to. Can you blame a tiger for eating up your dog? If you cannot keep your dog on the leash and a big gun nearby - it is not tiger's fault, it is its nature. Crooks will try to steal money. Bailouts and capital infusement are not the same.

The former involves the Treasury buying loans from banks with cash (that they inturn got from taxes or borrowing through bonds)

The latter involves the govt investing in the banks that it owns to acquire more assets. Nothing about loans.

So, this alone makes rest of the argument invalid.  >To put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.

I disagree. The [ARCs](http://www.indiafilings.com/learn/asset-reconstruction-company-arc-india/) take up most of the NPAs and make a profit (management fee!) on recovering bad loans (vasooli) ! Thanks for the post, man.  Most of these bad loans are secured loans meaning there's a property or company assets that are mortgaged. Right now it is a pain in the ass for banks to recover NPA loans through the SARFAESI act. I hope the rules are simplified so that willing defaulters can face the consequences they deserve.  Why can't loan defaulters be forced to declare bankruptcy and the bank then can pay off their creditors using the defaulter's assets? Bailing out is not an option because then the banks would continue to give out bad loans. One of the big reason for this is very high interest rates (15-18%) in our country. Business margins are shrinking. Most companies are finding it hard to repay interest on loan, forget the principal.

Bankruptcy laws in India are very complicated. Actually they don't exist in the form they exist in Western countries. I have heard of so many stories of businessmen taking huge loans from banks and then fixing the system to never repay it or only a partial amount. The entire machinery works to make this system very efficient, including, politicians, bank employees, businessmen, accountants and middle men. Individuals do well while we collectively are screwed. relevant info  Reported this article to rbi at their contact us page. 

                          \__(^_^)__/  **Blame**

1. Raghuram Rajan - NO. He is only doing what should have been done long time back. If NPAs were allowed to go unchecked, most of them would have eaten up the system and even more bailout money at a later date. As of now we are already in a global recession/slow growth, so this is the right time to absorb the losses rather than carrying it forward and having it crash a bull market.

2. UPA - YES. They made hay with jobless inflationary growth while pocketing huge sums between themselves. Too bad there's no political accountability, the least we should do is pressure them to stop putting obstructions in the reform process. I'm looking at you /u/tathagatasatpathy /u/kumbhakaran 

3. NDA-II - NO. Capital infusion to PSBs is required to offset the shitstorm. See the BoB 12 Feb jump in share price: http://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE:BANKBARODA. this was because they declared huge amounts of NPA. Now this is one bank which won't need any bailout in the near future. All banks must come clean with as much NPA as they can clean up. This, combined with the Bankrupty Bill, will allow quick cleanup, larger than usual recovery in cases where assets are still there, and we can move on with a clean conscience.

4. Banks. YES/NO - while the systems there are still alright, banks need to get rid of front desks which give loans for bribes. This should be a simple task. Look at the list of approving officers. Finds officers whose sanctions have disproportionately gone in the red, fire them, put cases against them and let I-T handle the rest.

5. Big Corporations - YES. Same as the officers above: find chronic defaulters, black list them, file cases against them as appropriate, and let appropriate authorities handle the rest.

6. *Common Man* - YES. There was a post yesterday asking for ideas on how the common man can help India grow. *Don't give or take bribes.* As simple as that. And this is probably harder than the 5 above. Didn't the SBI sanction a 1 billion loan for Adani? Good learning info for SSC CGL exam.",Business/Finance,2016-02-26 18:31:51

Moreover, NRIs who take admission in Indian engineering colleges receive the shock of their lives when they see that their fellow batchmates are already quite familiar with concepts of calculus that the SAT does not test at all. As a result, many of these students end up failing math in their first semester and might even begin a downward spiral due to depression.


Every year I keep hearing talks of IIMs wanting to be more like foreign b-schools where majority of the batch does not hail from an engineering background, but from commerce/business backgrounds. But it's not just about MBA programs. Even the batch profile of the Msc Finance program at JBIMS reveals that out of the 30 students it takes in, majority have engineering background.

And here I thought that it would make more sense for business and commerce grads to pursue an MFin because that is much more coherent than jumping over to MFin from engineering.

Boy do I have stories for you today!

Last week, a Rajya Sabha member was suspended for a day for making ‘unauthorised inane noise’; a controversial amendment was passed which allows foreign funding for political parties; the government of the day tactfully avoided being embarrassed by a new ‘Jumla’; and Big Tobacco fought the Government with Zero Hour Notices.

Let’s get right into it!

#Money Bill strikes again!
___
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a troubled lot. They have an easy majority in Lok Sabha, which allows them to push their bills through, but they don’t have the numbers in Rajya Sabha to do the same. For the past two years, the opposition in the upper house has blocked their legislative agenda through the creative use of their throats and by camping all around the speaker’s grand throne-chair, protesting away to glory. But the Government of the day seems to have a few tricks up its sleeve. They seem to be aiming to completely ignore the upper house by using the [Money Bill route](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/492acw/lets_talk_about_the_new_aadhaar_bill_it_can/). Twice!


The first instance of ‘Operation Money Bill’ was observed on March 11, when the Lok Sabha passed the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016. During the consideration of this bill, many members screamed bloody murder and opposed this legislation being certified as a Money Bill. It went to the Rajya Sabha for recommendations. The bill got passed, 4 days later, on March 16 in its original form. The government of the day seems to have hit Parliament procedure gold. So merely two months later, they decided to do it again.

And this time, it was to bring in FDI in politics!

The Finance Bill 2016 was passed in the Lok Sabha with a clause that did not belong in that legislation, namely, amendments the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA).

#BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players

The FCRA Amendment is a strange one. Earlier foreign companies were not allowed to make donations to political parties. For obvious reasons. Otherwise entities like Monsanto [would have a field day](http://imgur.com/AsZqfLk). 

The logic being that foreign entities should not be able to influence our Parliament to make laws that favor them. In 2014, both BJP and Congress were found guilty by the Delhi High Court of accepting foreign contributions from UK based company Vedanta. So the government of the day decided to deal with it by making a retrospective amendment to the FCRA act by hiding it within the Finance Bill.

This amendment has cleared Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha has no say in it (because, you know, ‘Operation Money Bill’) and the President’s approval will come soon. Say hello to FDI in Politics.

#The Curious Case of Finance Bill, 2016
___
During the debate on the Finance Bill on Wednesday, Asaduddin Owaisi raised a point of order to question the government on the validity of the FCRA amendment. He argued that this act comes under the Home Ministry and amending it through a Finance Bill goes against the provisions of the Constitution. He demanded that the discussion should be suspended immediately since the bill is flawed. 

The decision landed on the lap of deputy speaker of Lok Sabha Arjun Charan Singh, who looked like a dog-lover with a cat in his lap. Unsure what to do. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was away on an official visit to Germany so MoS Jayant Sinha tried to do a [ninja save](http://imgur.com/G9lMcPM). He told Owaisi that Jaitley will respond to his query while replying to the debate.

**[24 hours later](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/e8/24_Hours_Later..._.png/revision/latest?cb=20130519222728)**

While giving his reply speech, the Fin Min sort of ignored the FCRA issue. Instead, he spoke about giving funds to the Polavaram Dam. It upset Biju Janata Dal from Orissa enough to stage a rather noisy walkout. The debate ended abruptly and clause by clause on the Finance Bill began. 

Still no word about the point of order despite Owaisi asking the speaker for a ruling.

[Cricket sounds #1](http://imgur.com/DKiZ6Mw)

The Finance Minister had made 49 official amendments to the Finance Bill, so the speaker was going through them one by one. Clause 233, which concerns the controversial FCRA amendment, was clubbed in with Clauses 220 to 230, schedules first to fifteen and passed together.

[Cricket sounds #2](http://imgur.com/wn6P3Mv)

After the clause by clause consideration was completed, the speaker gave a ruling to Owaisi’s point of order and denied it. Ignoring protests from some members, she called for the passage of the bill.

[Cricket sounds #3](http://imgur.com/JxBvCE6)

Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha.

To give you a short rundown of this ‘Jumla’, in 2005 GSPC claimed that the KG Basin had an epic deposit of natural gas worth an estimated Rs. 2,20,000 crore. They spent Rs 19,700 crore over a period of a decade for ‘gas exploration’ but did not get even a tiny whiff of the sweet sweet hydrocarbon gas mixture. Five CAG reports over the past five years have pointed out discrepancies in the way GSPC operated. The Congress has been dying to dig deep into this issue and they finally did it in Rajya Sabha. They took out their shovels, ready to break the earth while singing merry songs of victory.

But then, they struck a rock called Arun Jaitley even before they started digging.

Jaitley told Azad that this issue cannot be raised in Parliament because the [Public Accounts Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(India) (PAC) is already examining it. The PAC is a committee of selected members of Parliament, constituted by the Parliament of India, for the auditing of the revenue and the expenditure of the Government of India. The house cannot deliberate on matters that a Parliamentary committee is already deliberating.

#Rule 255: Kick the disrupter
___
Rajya Sabha was yet again disrupted at the beginning of the week over the Agusta Westland issue. Members trooped into the well, shouting garbled slogans against the Government. Then, Rule 255 happened. 

> “The Chairman may direct any member whose conduct is in his opinion grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the Council and any member so ordered to withdraw shall do so forthwith and shall absent himself during the remainder of the day's meeting.” [Source](http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rs_rule/generalrulesproc.asp)

Hamid Ansari, Chairman of Rajya Sabha invoked this rule and ordered Sukhendu Roy of the TMC to be removed from the upper house for a day. Roy was seen standing at his seat and demanding (very loudly) to know who benefitted from the Agusta Westland scam. 

Here’s an excerpt from the debate:

[""Please stop making inane noise""](http://imgur.com/JQhbrjq)

[""Please stop talking... or else""](http://imgur.com/vl0UVaB)

[""RULE 255 BITCHES!!! GTFO!""](http://imgur.com/v3kMrpA)

After the Sukhendu Roy left, taking his ‘unauthorized inane noise’ with him, the Congress continued its valiant attempt to stall the proceedings in the house. Nitin Gadkari, visibly upset, requested Ansari to smite them with his awesome legal powers and invoke 255 on all of them. Ansari pointed out that Rule 255 applies only to individual members and cannot be enforced en masse.

#Big Tobacco vs Unhealthy Lung pictures
___
There have been three zero hour notices raised in the Lok Sabha this session regarding increasing health warnings on tobacco products to 85%. To give you some context, the government had passed an order in 2014 which mandated tobacco manufacturers to show gruesome pictures of decaying lungs that cover up to 85% of the product packet. 

The pictures would dissuade new smokers from taking up the deadly cause and it has been proven to be quite effective in many countries around the world. This order was to come into force on April 1 this year and there has been a battle raging between the Tobacco industry and the government on the sidelines. /u/dextermilburn has been talking about ITC shutting down and opening factories [in his posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4inj30/last_week_in_indian_economy_for_the_week_ending/) for a few weeks now. The Parliament also became a stage where this battle is being fought by filing notices in favor and against the government’s move.

Last week on May 3rd, Baijayant Panda raised a zero hour notice supporting the government’s move to increase the warning size. He urged the government to hold its ground on increasing health warnings and to implement its order diligently. 

On 27th April, two other members had raised a notice to oppose the government’s move, namely R Dhruvanarayana and Sharadkumar Bansode. Both of these members spoke about how tobacco farmers and beedi manufacturers will be adversely affected if these warnings are imposed. They wanted the government to consider the plight of the farmers connected to the industry and not impose the order.

Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court had a hearing where upheld the Government’s 2014 order and asked Tobacco companies to implement it.

**What is a Zero Hour and why is it important?**

‘Zero Hour’ refers to a time period in the Parliament when members can raise matters of urgent public importance to bring it to the notice of the government of the day. Every day when the Parliament is in session, there is one hour allotted to raise such notices. A member is required to file the notice in Parliament before 9 a.m. on the same day. A ballot takes place in which notices are randomly selected and are allowed to be raised. In Lok Sabha, the Zero hour usually happens from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and in Rajya Sabha, it happens from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. It’s upto the speakers in both houses to decide the time slot of the zero hour, depending on how heavy the legislative business is.

The Zero hour is easily one of the most ignored aspect of our Parliamentary process. It a perfect way to judge what is on the minds of our elected representatives. For instance, in the past two weeks numerous notices were raised on the water crisis and drought situation in the country. Considering that these notices are randomly selected through a ballot, the sheer volume points towards the fact that this crisis is bigger and badder than we imagine.

[Last Week's post.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4h3ioz/last_week_in_the_indian_parliament_april_25_april/)


EDIT: Tiny grammar edits and added last week's post.

EDIT2: Thank you for the gold (x2) kind strangers! It makes me really happy to see that so many people are interested in content of this nature. :)",kumbhakaran," This is brilliant. Has there been any media coverage at all about FDI in politics? This could change the way crony capitalism in this country works.  >BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players

>Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha.

Proof if any needed, that BJP & Congress are no different from each other! They'll join hands and throw out democracy if it benefited them.

>The ‘Jumla’ that escaped

Not just a 'jumla' but the likes of 'scam' that this very BJP govt chased Congress out of power!

In 2005, then CM Modi abruptly announced that the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) had discovered 20 trillion cubic feet of gas in KG basin (that the BJP promptly renamed the Deendayal West area block), which would generate revenue worth Rs. 2.2 lakh crore for India! Everyone (including the state and central administrations as well as subject experts) was astonished at this fantastic claim. 

If true, such a find would have made India energy self-sufficient, a must for any country aspiring for super power status. Modi’s announcement therefore generated euphoric excitement and even shifted the narrative from him being the alleged mastermind of the 2002 riots to a potential Prime Ministerial candidate. 

In fact, given how events unfolded, it is abundantly clear that the announcement (like everything else PM Modi does) was just another exaggerated publicity stunt.

 Modiji pays heed exclusively to his own mann ki baat! He thus ignored the field report, and forced GSPC to go ahead with the project. Because of this, GSPC borrowed nearly Rs 20,000 crore from 15 different public and private sector banks. And what does India have in return? Nothing! 

But the issue is not just about Modiji’s gaseous exaggerations. It is also about diversion of public funds and corruption. After coercing GSPC to go ahead with drilling in KG basin, CM Modi forced it to partner with a company named Geo Global. Now here’s the interesting bit:

*Geo Global  was reportedly incorporated just six days before the agreement with GSPC. At the time of entering into the agreement with GSPC, Geo Global’s capital was reportedly a measly Rs 3,200. A week after the agreement, its capital mushroomed to Rs 10,000 crore.*

>In its report for the year ended March 31, 2015, tabled in state assembly this year, CAG had pulled up GSPC for its lack of experience as 'overseas operator'. ""The delay in execution of the work committed resulted in cost escalations in overseas blocks. As a result, the company had incurred expenditure of Rs 1,757.46 crore for 10 surrendered blocks, of which Rs 1,734.12 crore has been written off,"" the apex auditor noted.

Was this public money diverted to fund Modi ji’s extravagant 2014 election campaign? Does this not merit an independent high level judicial probe? And even more interestingly, when the screws were tightened on Vijay Mallya for defaulting on Rs. 9000 crore, why is GSPC not being subject to similar treatment? Why is it that instead, its Managing Director was rewarded with an appointment as the [Director of the National Informatics Centre?](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-06-18/news/63568239_1_gujarat-state-petroleum-corporation-deity-gspc)

However, desperately the BJP may sycophantically defend PM Modi, the bitter reality is that under him corruption was rampant in Gujarat. Consider how [he gave 250 acres of land (in a restricted wildlife zone) to cronies of the current CM of Gujarat for less than Rs. 1.5 crore.](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/anandiben-patels-daughter-in-soup-over-gir-sanctuary-land-deal-congress-wants-sit-probe/1/588670.html)

Similarly, [CM Modi gave public land for the Mundra SEZ.](http://www.frontline.in/cover-story/the-great-land-grab/article4666181.ece), which was worth Rs. 1500 per square metre for a pittance (anything between Rs. 01 & Rs. 32) That is why for years, the CAG was deliberately denied access to numerous files in Gujarat. And that is also why under Modi ji, a Lokayukta was not appointed for 10 years.

In his avatar as Prime Ministerial candidate, Modi ji had famously argued “main na khata hoon, na khaane deta hoon”. It seems the truth is different.

19,700 crore you mean right? 

Also, nice work! :) Hey, this is very interesting. Please keep it up, thank you! Firstly, great job man. This is the real shit. I'm so angry about FDI in politics, and other issues I wouldn't really have cared to watch Rajya Sabha TV/Lok Sabha TV for.

I wanted to ask- what is the law regarding corporations donating to campaigns of political parties in India? Are corporations considered as people and granted the same rights of free speech? (free speech = throw money where you want, that's the logic in US Supreme Courts' Citizen United anyways) thank you sir, for your valuable service.

I really look forward to next week.

I am whatsapp-ing this link to couple of groups. This makes my blood boil, what can citizens do to curb this ? >During the debate on the Finance Bill on Wednesday, **Asaduddin Owaisi** raised a point of order to question the government on the validity of the FCRA amendment.


wow, so everyone remains quiet and only he had the guts to question to this? Dude, thanks a lot for what you do.

Randia needs this. Dude that was an amazing read! Thanks a lot for this summary. Many people do not understand legislative business and do not have awareness of public policy affairs. We think that job of an MP is to take appointments of ministers, get funds by hook or nook , attend the projects opening ceremonies and take some commissions on the way.If someone comes in their way, get them transferred.

I work with Loksatta party (Dr Jayaprakash Narayan) and feel very bad sometimes knowing the apathy of fellow citizens towards public policy and legislative process. The new media (anyone with a website) does not have due diligence in verifying facts and just need a clickbait headline.  Thanks for this /u/kumbhakaran.

Some examples where credit ratings agencies have been disproven and discredited time and time again,13,7dskdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7dskdq/some_examples_where_credit_ratings_agencies_have/,9,"Should Indian government really be celebrating? Here are some examples to think not - 

1.""In November 1998, the day after the Japanese Government announced a large-scale fiscal stimulus to its ailing economy, Moody’s Investors Service began the first of a series of downgradings of the Japanese Government’s yen-denominated bonds, by taking the Aaa (triple A) rating away. The next major Moody’s downgrade occurred on September 8, 2000.

Then, in December 2001, Moody’s further downgraded the Japan Governments yen-denominated bond rating to Aa3 from Aa2. On May 31, 2002, Moody’s Investors Service cut Japan’s long-term credit rating by a further two grades to A2, or below that given to Botswana, Chile and Hungary.

In a statement at the time, Moody’s said that its decision “reflects the conclusion that the Japanese government’s current and anticipated economic policies will be insufficient to prevent continued deterioration in Japan’s domestic debt position … Japan’s general government indebtedness, however measured, will approach levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world, and as such Japan will be entering ‘uncharted territory’.”

The then Japanese Finance Minister responded (with some foresight): “They’re doing it for business. Just because they do such things we won’t change our policies … The market doesn’t seem to be paying attention.” Indeed, the Government continued to have no problems finding buyers for their debt, which is all yen-denominated and sold mainly to domestic investors. 
How … could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself? Japan, with an economy almost 1,000 times the size of Botswana’s, has the world’s largest foreign reserves, $446 billion; the world’s largest domestic savings, $11.4 trillion; and about $1 trillion in overseas investments. And 95 percent of the debt is held by Japanese people 

In the New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/business/international-business-japan-battles-bond-rating.html] the logic of the rating was questioned:

2. Comment by formers President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and former member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Bob McTeer who is described as having “free-market views” which “gave the Dallas Fed its reputation during his tenure as “The Free-Enterprise Fed”” (Source). McTeer says:

    It may just be me, but aren’t the credit rating agencies supposed to be rating credit?

    Yesterday, we saw a sharp market reaction when one of the rating agencies that gave AAA ratings to mortgage-backed securities larded with subprime loans called into question the credit worthiness of Britain. As is the case with the United States and the Federal Reserve, Britain and its Bank of England have the ability to create new money if necessary to pay off its debt at maturity. There is no sovereign credit risk. There is no need for credit rating agencies to opine on the credit worthiness of sovereign debt.

    Sovereign debt is subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates in general rise, outstanding bonds, sovereign and non-sovereign, will decline in price, the extent depending on how close they are to maturity.

    Sovereign debt is also subject to inflation risk. Holders of the debt are harmed if inflation outpaces their expectations when they purchased the debt.

    When Standard & Poor questions British bonds, they must be making a judgment about some risk other than credit risk. Given time, investors will learn to take such questions with a grain of salt and not overreact. Meanwhile, haven’t they done enough harm for this cycle?""

4.""Ratings agencies admit mistakes - Credit rating agencies have admitted errors were made when assessing some of the financial instruments that have been blamed for the credit crunch.

Representatives of the three main agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch, Moodys - were grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

They said that their assessment of securities backed by sub-prime mortgages turned out to be incorrect.

But they said these instruments were not too complex to rate accurately.

""The assumption that we made about how these assets would perform in the future turned out to be incorrect,"" said Ian Bell, head of European structured finance at Standard & Poor's.

Iceland role

Credit agencies carry out work to determine the worthiness or otherwise of financial investments.

They have been accused of failing to spot the size and risk of the bad US housing debt that was resold around the world, causing multi-billion-pound losses.

It was the discovery of these losses that caused the global credit markets to freeze up, and ultimately led to governments around the world having to bail out their banking sectors.

The ratings agencies said that credit ratings were just one factor that investors should look at when making investment decisions, but admitted that less sophisticated investors may have been over-reliant on their assessments.

The committee also criticised the agencies for failing to warn their clients adequately of the problems faced by the Icelandic economy before its banks collapsed last year.

Some 116 local councils deposited more than £858m in the failed banks, because they offered a relatively high return with a high credit rating.""

    The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies.

8. Moody's And Japan - But think about the Moodys statement in relation to Japan. The logic (and that is being kind) goes like this:

             1. Economic growth is low in Japan and is pushing tax revenue down and welfare spending up – hence the budget deficit rises.

              2. Given the Japanese government doesn’t exercise its legal right to spend without issuing debt to match the spending, the rising budget deficit (as a result of the cyclical downturn) also means rising public debt.

             3. Moodys asserts (with no analytical or conceptual basis provided) that these rising deficits are in some way a problem per se (rather than being a reflection of the real problem – slow growth).

            4. So in their Pavlovian fashion, they downgrade the credit rating presumably suggesting the Japanese government is a credit risk without acknowledging the Japanese government can never be an credit risk unless there is a collective brain explosion and the Government legislates to renege on its financial obligations.

            5. They downgrade because the slow growth makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit without acknowledging that the budget deficit should increase to meet the challenge of slow growth.

           6. But then you are left to ask two questions. First, the Moodys logic would suggest they want to increase the borrowing costs of the Japanese government by reducing the demand for bonds (because the lower rating is meant to scare investors) which if you believed their type of reasoning would further negatively impact on economic growth. So what sort of logic is that? Moodys (if you had their model outlook) is saying the Japanese economy is damaged because of the recession but we are going to make it worse and therefore worsen the problem of credit risk.

           7. Second, of-course, neither their implicit notion that Japanese government debt carries a credit risk or that their ratings change anything anyway are valid. Note that a sign that government paper was not an attractive investment prospect might be rising yields as investors avoided demanding the paper. But Moodys acknowledges that there is an “undiminished home bias of Japanese investors and their preference for government bonds, which allows the government’s fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally”.

So who would you bet on? A corrupt capitalist firm that has made some monumental mistakes in the past while handing out AAA ratings to firms who were paying them to rate their products or millions of investors who every day purchase Japanese government debt at stable and the lowest yields? The same investors who have been buying Japanese government debt while deficits have been rising and public debt ratios heading up beyond 200 per cent (compared to the ridiculous Reinhardt Rogoff default threshold of 80 per cent) for the last 20 years.""

8. ""What mindless rule is being applied here?

The whole thing is mindless. To repeat, the logic appears to be: Cut deficits to keep the Aaa rating – but that would undermine growth and push up the deficit and debt – which undermines the Aaa rating.

And the politicians and everyone else goes along with this nonsense. We really are not a very bright race of people.""

I am forwarding an interesting story about world economy. How valid is it? I leave it to you. Another whatsapp forward,8,7jrv4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jrv4g/i_am_forwarding_an_interesting_story_about_world/,8,"Amazing logic indeed. This is a crazy world! Interesting article written by an Indian Economist

Japanese save a lot. They do not spend much. Also, Japan exports far more than it imports. Has an annual trade surplus of over 100 billion. Yet Japanese economy is considered weak, even collapsing.

Americans spend, save little. Also US imports more than it exports.
Has an annual trade deficit of over $400 billion. Yet, the American economy is considered strong and trusted to get stronger.

But where from do Americans get money to spend? They borrow from Japan, China and even India.
Virtually others save for the US to spend. Global savings are mostly invested in US, in dollars.

India itself keeps its foreign currency assets of over $50 billion in US securities. China has sunk over $160 billion in US securities.
Japan's stakes in US securities is in trillions.

Result:
The US has taken over $5 trillion from the world. So, as the world
saves for the US - It's The Americans who spend freely. Today, to keep the US consumption going, that is for the US economy to work, other
countries have to remit $180 billion every quarter, which is $2
billion a day, to the US!

A Chinese economist asked a neat question. Who has invested more, US in China, or China in US? The US has invested in China less than half of what China has invested in US.

The same is the case with India. It have invested in US over $50
billion. But the US has invested less than $20 billion in India.

Why the world is after US?

The secret lies in the American spending, that they hardly save. In fact they use their credit cards to spend their future income. That the US spends is what makes it attractive to export to the US. So US imports more than what it exports year after year.

The result:

The world is dependent on US consumption for its growth. By its deepening culture of consumption, the US has habituated the world to
feed on US consumption. But as the US needs money to finance its consumption, the world provides the money.

It's like a shopkeeper providing the money to a customer so that the customer keeps buying from the shop. If the customer will not buy, the shop won't have business, unless the shopkeeper funds him. The US is like the lucky customer. And the world is like the helpless shopkeeper
financier.

Who is America's biggest shopkeeper financier? Japan of course. Yet it's Japan which is regarded as weak. Modern economists complain that
Japanese do not spend, so they do not grow. To force the Japanese to spend, the Japanese government exerted itself, reduced the savings
rates, even charged the savers. Even then the Japanese did not spend (habits don't change, even with taxes, do they?). Their traditional postal savings alone is over $1.2 trillion. Thus, savings, far from being the strength of Japan, has become its pain.

Hence, what is the lesson?

That is, a nation cannot grow unless the people spend, not save. Not just spend, but borrow and spend.
Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, the famous Indian-born economist in the US, told Manmohan Singh that Indians wastefully save. Ask them to spend, on imported cars and, seriously, even on cosmetics! This will put India on a growth curve. This is one of the reason for MNC's coming down to India, seeing the consumer spending.

'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue.'
But before you follow this Neo Economics, get some fools to save so that you can borrow from them and spend !!!
The world is in a economical mess 😅- interesting read",yasar434," But when Americans spend money in America, the money stays in America. But if you will spend money in India, most of this money will go out of India.
Example: Buy a IPhone product in America and India.  I get a feel this is snake oil logic. 

People need money to spend. Here currency is inr, so exporters would get paid in inr, and hence the Q may be to ask why is dollar so much more valuable and also why do Americans have so much more of it ? 

I have personally thought over what creates value at the very core and the answer always seems to me to be creation of new intellectual property in which US is the leader and will be for more time to come. 

As to why Americans have so much of it? I think it might be a very complicated Q and part of answer might be that they print it and also that lot of countries want to save in dollars and also invest in infrastructure creation in America... 
 This is not true on so many levels - the most obvious being that the spending habits of a nations's people has a very weak relationship (and even an inverse relationship sometimes) with the national debt. This is literally why macroeconomic indicators and microeconomic indicators should not be lumped or confused. Japan as a country is one of the most indebted nations with a debt to GDP ratio of 240%, while US is at about 106%. But it is just an indicator. If a government is borrowing mostly from its citizens in the form of government bonds (like the US) its not a big deal. If a government is borrowing to finance projects which will lead to economic growth, it can pay off those debts and have surplus left over in the future so its not a problem. For example, Greece's peak debt to GDP ratio of 160% was a huge concern because the economy was not growing, while the Japanese economy has strong fundamentals so they can keep borrowing.

Also if you look at it from the other side, China basically needs new jobs every year to feed its people. It is an export driven economy that pays for these jobs by selling the massive amount US dollars it gets from these exports for RMB (Yuan) that it then gives to its people. But this increases the supply for US dollars which left unchecked would overvalue the RMB and China would then lose its competitive edge in the manufacturing market. So to always keep the Yuan slightly undervalued it buys enough long-term US government bonds. These bonds also act as low risk investments that keep its portfolio diversified against the high risk manufacturing projects that it takes on in Africa for example.

So platitudes like 'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue' might sound reasonable and be applicable at a microeconomic level, but does not work at all when you are talking about countries. 'Keep your investment portfolio diversified' is a better saying that applies to virtually all levels of consumers. Hmm I don't know why people in the thread are thinking this is some mind blowing non mainstream line of thought.

OP can be easily explained as a version of Keynesian economics and demand side economics. Put money in the pockets of workers and the economy will grow because they spend more than they save. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-demandside-economics.asp Looks like another attempt at emotional blackmailing Indians to give up their gold and other savings for a better “future”  The reason why everyone ""invests"" in Dollars is because that is the currency for oil trade.

Unless you have a specific agreement like India and Iran, the default currency to buy crude oil is USD.

So everytime, every country wants to buy oil, it has to buy USD from the market and then pay the oil supplier. This keeps the USD strong compared to other currencies.

Also, the reason Americans consume so much is because they don't have strict import laws to ""protect"" the local industries like we do. The buyers in the US are free to choose what quality of products they want to use. And usually it's an imported products that is priced better than a local brand.

If we (India) remove import duty, we fear that Tata and Mahindra will die out. While the US takes it as a challenge and makes newer Chevys and Fords and, ahem, Chryslers.

###Headline Stories

**The Good News: Inflation**

Do you hear that sound? That’s the sound of retail stores in India reducing their prices to a 3 month low. After rising for five straight months, retail inflation in February came down to 5.18%. This has been [attributed](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-14/news/71509641_1_retail-inflation-price-rise-pulses) largely to a fall in the prices of vegetables, pulses and fruits. While cereal prices remained the same, the dark lining is that prices of eggs shot up significantly. Time to substitute omelets with salads, perhaps? But that’s just the retail end of business. Coming to the wholesale side of business, inflation in wholesale prices fell for the 16th straight month and remained [negative](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Decline-in-inflation-on-expected-line-Finanace-ministry/articleshow/51400780.cms) at -0.91%. The data comes from the Consumer and Wholesale Price Indices, which track retail and wholesale prices around the country.


**The Bad News: Foreign Trade**

Not to harsh your mellow, but stop rejoicing over the good news for a second and hear this. India’s February Exports decreased by 5.66%. If you haven’t been following the export numbers, and no one can blame you for that, this is the 15th consecutive month in which exports have [decreased](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rfZrfTFsUFMVWkTXV8wEAK/Indias-February-trade-deficit-narrows-to-65-billion.html). Petroleum products was the dark swan as exports of gasoline, jet fuel etc. fell by 28%. The golden goose of the bunch was jewellery as exports of shiny rings and necklaces increased by 11%. Just to give you some perspective, our brothers to the north, the Chinese saw their exports fall by 25%. On the flip side, India’s imports also decreased by 5.03%. You win some, you lose some, right? 


**Rajya Sabha Feels Betrayed**

Giving statutory backing to the unique identity number system, the Lok Sabha this week has passed the [Aadhaar Bill](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lok-sabha-passes-aadhaar-bill/article8361467.ece?homepage=true). This newly passed bill is a significant instrument for the government’s Direct Transfer Benefits scheme for better targeting of subsidies. The argument against it was that it violated the Supreme Court order that said an Aadhaar Card cannot be mandatory but only voluntary. Now, if you remember your 7th standard civics syllabus, both houses of the parliament, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, have to pass a bill for it to become a law. What your 7th standard civics textbook probably didn’t mention is the Rajya Sabha has no say in the matter if a specific bill is categorized as a “money bill”. Which is exactly what Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who piloted the Aadhaar bill through parliament, did so that it can bypass the Rajya Sabha where Jaitley’s BJP does not have a majority. One can only imagine how emotionally hurt the Rajya Sabha was when the Lok Sabha went behind its back to pass the Aadhaar Bill. 

**It’s Raining Black Gold: Sweet, Sweet Oil**

“Tass-Yurikah” sounds like an Urdu swear word, but it’s actually the name of a Russian oil field. Soon enough, it won’t even be entirely Russian anymore. A group of Indian oil companies signed a deal with Rosneft, the Russian oil company that owns [Tass-Yurikah](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ongc-videsh-ltd-ioc-consortium-to-buy-russian-oil-fields-for-4-2-billion/articleshow/51427860.cms), to buy a 29.9% stake in the oilfield for $1.28 billion (₹8,505 crore). This puts the Indians in partnership with the British oil major BP who owns 20% while the remaining 50.1% is still owned by Rosneft. Deals to explore a possible stake sale in Vankor, another Russian oilfield, were also signed. This comes at a time when global oil prices are falling off a cliff, just like BJP’s poll numbers in that [recent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_Legislative_Assembly_election,_2015) Bihar election. This also comes at a time when Russia’s economy is suffering from an acute case of international sanctions that were imposed on Russia after they snatched Crimea from Ukraine, just like the JD(U) snatched seats from BJP in that recent Bihar election. Too political? Thought so. Meanwhile, they just [hiked](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/economy/article-petrol-price-hiked-by-rs-3-07-litre-diesel-by-rs-1-90-litre-1287407) petrol and diesel prices by 3.07/litre and 1.07/litre.

**Ban on 344 Illegal Drugs**

The government is playing the game that everyone knows it excels at - banning things. This time around, the health ministry has issued a ban on over [344 drugs](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/health-ministry-bans-344-fixed-dose-combination-drugs-1286977). No, not the one’s that make you hallucinate or see sounds and hear colours, but the one’s that are pharmaceutical. Known as “combination drugs”, these drugs combine two or more drugs together so the patient only has to pop one pill instead of three. Technically, they were being sold illegally since none of them had approval from the central government, but had entered markets nevertheless after receiving blessings from only the state governments. At least this time around, the bans make more sense. Cough syrup Corex and the famous Vicks Action 500 were among the 344 substances banned. However, the Delhi High Court reversed the ban on [Corex](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/corporates/article-corex-popular-cough-syrup-not-banned-for-now-says-court-1287076?ndtv_related) and is set to hear the case on March 21st after Pfizer ([PFIZER](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APFIZER&ei=uk_vVqjdIoSVjAGihJ_IBw)), the company that makes Corex, sent lawyers marching down to the Court right away. Feeling a bit jealous of Pfizer, 21 other pharmaceutical companies, including P&G India ([PGHH](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APGHH&ei=tk_vVsGTOJPwjAGTuZQg)), the maker of [Vicks](http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/hc-relief-for-14-more-drug-firms/210246.html), also managed to convince the court to reverse bans placed on their drugs as well.

**Make Room for One More Tax**

You know how countries sometimes impose tariffs on foreign goods to make domestic players competitive? Well, states across India such as Uttarakhand, Bihar and Assam seem to have forgotten that they are not independent countries but merely states within one. It’s okay, we all go through an identity crisis at some point. Lawmakers in those states have imposed an “[entry tax](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-15/news/71543125_1_entry-tax-goods-services-tax-levy)” on e-commerce websites for selling products that were not made in those states - which sounds eerily similar to tariffs imposed by sovereign nations. What could make this worse? Almost half a dozen other states are also considering imposing a similar tax on e-commerce goods sold inside the state that were manufactured outside the state. If this goes through, you might have to foot the bill for your state’s poor manufacturing as online retailers pass these taxes on to the customer. Also, the grapevine has it that Amazon offered to acquire Flipkart for [$8 billion](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Flipkart-and-Amazon-may-have-explored-sale-talks-say-sources/articleshow/51421374.cms) (₹53,160 crore) last year, but the deal fell through. Make of that what you will.

TIL, that the PPF rates were around 3% in 1950s, 4% in 60s, touched 8% in 70s, touched 12% in late 80s and stayed there till 2000 and started coming down from 2001 to the current 8.1%.

Thank you dude. You are the hero randia needs. This is great stuff. Mods this needs to be stickied.   [The oil deal with Rosneft seems good](http://russia-insider.com/en/indians-buy-russian-oil-field-13-billion/ri13404), but how will they ship it from Siberia? Like, literal tanker ships? Wish we could build a pipeline or something.. Egg prices went up? I paid Rs3.80 per egg, lower from the previous 4.75, 4.25 etc. And the ship nearby has a fixed price Rs5 always. Nice read. A little less passive aggressive next time please. Also ""do you hear that sound"" lolcat etc. is a little lame, no offense.  Minor nag: In foreign trade, you could also include the numbers trade deficit. That would be  more helpful than saying ""You win some, you lose some"".

I also don't understand why 30% of your short paragraph on Russian oil fields is about state elections in Bihar. I understand that you want to use analogies and examples to make the data more easy to understand for others, but at least for me that example was distracting and unhelpful.

Well written, and informative.
Please keep up the good work. The ban on medicines is really gonna play two ways, because now instead when a doctor used to prescribe a single tablet he's gonna prescribe multiple because that particular combination is banned, well it doesn't sound too bad to pop a couple pills instead of one but it's gonna cost you more to do that. You don't thing companies will turn down the costs? They might turn them up to recover from the loses this will cause them. 

> Technically, they were being sold illegally since none of them had approval from the central government, but had entered markets nevertheless after receiving blessings from only the state governments.

I am always surprised at how our government manages to fuck up so bad. State governments gave them a big go, why'd they not produce them. If this were kept under a check since the start, we might not had to face this day at all, maybe we had even cheaper medicine available. But now, it just kinda looks like medicine is gonna get costlier for the common man.

Just look at how this will hit the smaller scale companies, throwing the current stock away would probably cost them hundreds of crores, well I can even look at some of the smaller bunch of companies closing up cause of it. Again, the richer companies didn't take much of a hit did they. Well if all the mainstream products aren't even going anywhere, I don't get the point of this ban? This ban more of sounds like *let's make the little ones suffer* sort of a ban, I'd at least expect them to give a timeline in which the products would be banned. Banning something which doesn't cause significant health damage out of the blue, without prior notices, without an approved scientific study shouldn't be legal. Does this remind anyone else of NPR Marketplace?  Why are cement stocks booming at a time when Public investment and infrastructure activity is on an all time low? Budget effect? Love the post it is informative and funny and for a layman. Love the fact that you explained what spectrum is.


I wanted to give you gold but being a typical Indian, here have an upvote instead   >Ban on 344 Illegal Drugs

Ok, I read so many articles on this topic and yet not one had the full list of banned drugs. Why the hell is health ministry so uptight? Do we need to file an RTI for every damn thing now? 

When it comes to drugs, our government is one of the least transparent. No prior notifications, no public consultations, no meetings... they just ~~~~release a vague press release with no solid information~~~~. This is not the first time they did this, the same thing happens all the time when it comes to their ""essential"" drugs list.

5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard ?,31,6cfxc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6cfxc8/5_reasons_why_layoff_in_india_can_be_especially/,21,"""Top 5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard"" 

Do you agree? 

1. Social stigma: The middle-class in India attaches a lot of ‘status’ to what one does for a living. Among the first questions one gets asked during introductions include “where do you work?” (or “Where does your husband work?”). “He used to work for Infosys and just got laid-off” doesn’t cut it.  

2. Identity and self-worth: Typical middle-class kids are conditioned to work hard to succeed. When one is laid-off due to factors beyond one’s control (‘business reasons’) one begins to question one’s basic values. 

3. Pressure from relatives: Those from an earlier generation – parents, uncles and relatives of IT workers – equate ‘layoff’ to ‘firing.’ Right after layoff, they may begin to gossip “Ramesh was fired by Wipro. I though he was doing well there. What did he do wrong?” 

4. Financial challenges : Many IT workers over-leveraged their finances by “Investing” in expensive, upscale apartments, houses, cars and white-goods with large EMIs and credit card payments. Sudden stoppage of a paycheck can certainly be hard. 

5. Other practical challenges:  Many of those who are being laid-off are single and in their twenties and early thirties. Until recently, an ‘IT groom’ with a nice paycheck was a prime-catch in the matrimonial market. All the news of doom-and-gloom in IT sector is perhaps making families with eligible brides and grooms re-think alliances from those in IT sector.

( [source link](http://www.beyondlayoff.com/2017/05/top5layoff.html) )",mydigitalstartup," >All the news of doom-and-gloom in IT sector is perhaps making families with eligible brides and grooms re-think alliances from those in IT sector.

Now families will start updating their daughter's matrimonial profiles with a new line 

*IT employees kindly don't contact Most of these are related to, ""oh, what will the society think of me"". While I get the importance of fitting into society, and not being an outcast, our incessant desire to be ""approved"" by people is doing us more harm than good. How can a person, going through such a tough time, see an sliver of hope, when their mind is clouded worrying about their perception by others?

Ours is a shallow, judgmental society. They'll celebrate you when you have succeeded according to their standards, but also denigrate and vilify you, when you go through a tough time, like a layoff, or fail an exam. That is a really toxic attitude. It makes a bad situation worse. The person cannot see a setback as an opportunity to become better or take a break to clear their mind, but as a final word on their identity and fate.

It's borderline psychotic what our society considers acceptable behaviour to a person going through a difficult time. All sound like probable valid reasons, but are signs of an unhealthy society. I was about to write a long write up going into detail here, but I lost interest.   [deleted] Hard? Yes. But totally justified. We Indians are inherently assholes. I have seen several people just sit on their ass all day and do nothing after they reach a certain position because they start believing that no one can touch them. Every year they get a small increment and every few years a promotion. We need to stop this culture and show them that it's not gonna work. All well OP?  You can always lie. It is difficult to verify if you are an employee of an IT company. Stupid points , 1,2 and 3 are essentially same.
Social stigme covers relatives. And 4 is just patently wrong. In India people are less leveraged than already USA..
 
 anyone know where I can actually meet some of these people laid off? I'm a reporter. Is there like a park or some place a bunch of recently laid off people hang out? What do they do in their free time? sorry if its a dumb question ... lol. Contact Indian farmers..the'll show how it's done. ",Business/Finance,2017-05-21 18:43:06

Universal social security proposed, also accident insurance for the poor through Jan Dhan Yojana.  MUDRA micro finance with priority for SC/ST. Pencho, why not make it equally ~~viable~~ available for EVERYBODY? man, woman, youth etc? SC/ST ka kitna chateyga?

edit: ~~word~~. Lol. Gadkari ko peeche bhaga diya. Whoa. AIIMS in 5 states. And 1 more in Bihar. IIT in Karnataka. IIM in J &K and AP. [deleted] If he keeps inflation below 6%, does that mean the indexation benefits of debt funds will be much lower? and effective tax higher?

Rs 12/year premium pe gareebo ko 2 lakh ka accident insurance. Just started watching - so far if seems similar to increased outlays, and reduced income.
The bet is that growth makes up the difference. Risky bet since we are already on an uptrend because of the global cycle, the real non cycle growth is what I'm hoping to see grow.

**27 Banks today = 6 Banks Tomorrow**

Strength in unity is the chant on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s mind as a new expert committee was set up to explore possible [bank mergers](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-may-form-6-stong-banks-from-merger-of-27-psbs-to-tackle-rising-bad-loan-issue-2186336) to bring down the number of state-run banks in India from 27 today to just 6 in the future. And with the bad loans crisis looming over the banking industry, strength is just what the doctor prescribed. Apparently, since public sector banks are already short-staffed, bank employees don’t have to worry about downsizing in case any of these mergers actually happen. Words of caution, however: Too big to fail?

**IIP: Third Time’s (not) the Charm**

For the third month in a row, [industrial production](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/G1Hs0uma1LuBdMLkYpQlFL/Indias-IIP-contracts-15-in-January-third-month-in-a-row.html) in India went down. The numbers for the month of January released just recently by the Central Statistical Organization don’t look good - a 1.5% drop in industrial production, that’s against a 1.2% drop in December and a 3.2% drop in November. That is bad with a capital B. Silver lining on the cloud that’s raining on everyone’s parade? Mining and Electricity sectors grew by 1.2% and 6.6% in January respectively. Raghuram Rajan, the main god that economists around the country worship who also moonlights as the Governor of RBI, has called the numbers “disappointing” while stating that though the economy is in recovery, the process is volatile.

**Housing For All by 2022**

So you thought Swachh Bharat was Prime Minister Modi’s only pet project? Then you haven’t heard about the Housing For All initiative under which the PM aims to provide homes for all Indian families by 2022. The country inched a step closer to that goal when the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament, passed a landmark bill seeking to regulate the [Real Estate](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-realestate-regulations-parliament-idINKCN0WC1DJ) sector to bring more transparency and protect consumer interests. And this bill.. get this, was passed by bipartisan support as even the Congress came out of the woodwork to extend its support. Now when was the last time you heard about the ruling and the opposition party coming together and working to pass important legislation? Almost makes you wonder if they are.. [up to something](https://j.gifs.com/v29nEn.gif).

**Not Happening: EPF Tax**

The government has suddenly become very sensitive to any kind of backlash as was apparent when Arun Jaitley announced that a key budget proposal to tax withdrawals from EPF exceeding 40% of total investment would be rolled back. The proposal led to controversy among the small but vocal professional class who viewed it as a tax on the hard-working middle-class employees, and thus was promptly [shot down](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-pensions-epf-tax-withdraw-jaitley-idINKCN0WB0BE). Might it have anything to do with the not one, not two, not three, but five states holding elections in April and May? With politics, you can be sure that the elections have a big role in.. really everything that politicians do or don’t do. 

**Vijay Mallya Just Can’t Win**

It’s hard to empathize with the problems of rich billionaires, but poor Mallya just can’t seem to catch a break. A debt recovery tribunal in Bengaluru has [cash blocked](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-barred-from-accessing-rs-515-crore-severance-pay-1284719) Vijay Mallya by halting the $75 million (₹515 crore) payment he was set to receive as settlement from Diageo plc., the largest shareholder in Mallya’s United Spirits Ltd. ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=yRjmVsGsBsWd2Aas8ovwBg)). Later, a bunch of banks ganged up on him as they seized [trademarks](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-mallya-idUSKCN0WC184) related to the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines, trademarks such as “Kingfisher”, “Flying Models” and “King of Good Times”. And then came the accusations that Mallya has fled the country, which led to the banks asking a court to return and impound his passport. Moral of the story: Kids, never borrow $1.4 billion to run a flashy airliner when you can’t repay it. Especially when you already own a successful liquor company.

**Ambani vs. Netflix**

Mukesh Ambani has decided that there is no way Netflix can just waltz into India and lay claim to his homeground without facing any competition. Not one to keep his hands off any pie, he is reportedly entering the country’s cable TV sector through his latest venture called RJio. Ambani’s Reliance Industries ([RELIANCE](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ARELIANCE&ei=DBnmVsG4Atf3jAHklKf4DA)) which already owns TV channels like CNBC, Colors, ETV and many more is planning to spend about $2 billion (₹13,403 crore) over the next three years to capture 20 million TV subscribers. One of the offerings in store from RJio is [Jio Play](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-reliance-cable-tv-idUSKCN0W92J4), a movie and TV series streaming service, in short, it’s version of Netflix. India being a massive entertainment market, Netflix probably isn’t going to watch this from the sidelines. Grab the popcorn, this movie just might get interesting.

**RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot**

After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.


**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**

Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.

**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**

Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.

**Are Diamonds Forever?**

That’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**

In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.

The PM says that the policy change of giving LPG subsidies directly in consumers’ bank accounts has [saved](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lpg-subsidy-in-bank-accounts-has-saved-rs-15000-crore-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/51565031.cms) about ₹15,000 crore, as 85 lakh Indians gave up their subsidy. 15,000 crore sounds like a big number, but how much is it worth exactly? A back of the envelope calculation says it can fund ISRO’s entire budget for almost 2 years. Either that or we can just make the Iron Man 3 movie about 750 times.

Raju Rastogi from 3 Idiots or Alok Gupta from Five Point Someone, embodied the typical rags to riches story of a poor kid with dreams getting into an IIT. Well, future Raju Rastogis of the country are going to have to pay more to live that dream. They just hiked tuition [fees](http://www.deccanherald.com/content/539261/iit-fee-hiked-rs-2.html) at IIT from ₹90,000 per year to ₹2 lakh per year.

",DexterMilburn," This thread series is my favorite of all and I feel like I should start something similar for civic issues and RTI.  1) the rio tinto mine goes through the panna national park area and I don't know how happy I am about that 

2) the sun Edison blew in the face man.  They bid aggressively in reverse auction in national solar parks which was paraded with so much galore, only knowing that it's pretty much not in tune with market price 

3) how's Tata Tiago? Thinking of buying a small car for mother  Bad loans being bought by ARCs... Sounds familiar. Precursor to new economic disasters to come? 
  
P.S. OP I love you Absolutely brilliant, but I used to enjoy your humor too.

Dude, you sometimes make ""it's vs its"" error. Submitted the survey too.  Thanks for the weekly update and quality reading as always. Just one suggestion - The equity index movements should be against previous week's end and this week's end rather than this week's open and end. 

Cheers, keep up the stellar work. Start email newsletter... For someone who has started to have interest in economics and social sciences, a must watch video - [How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)

Also podcasts like freakonomics and radiolab really help to understand many news and social issues from a scientific and academic point of view > Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

Subtle, very subtle!! Have never really commented on this thread (actually I don't remember commenting - god I've been here so long), but just wanted to drop in a message and say thank you. Tell me how I can support this initiative? I'm a corporate lawyer and I can help with some of the news stuff you are covering (also will donating gold help?)

 Great job /u/DexterMilburn. Just curious on how are you able to afford time and patience to do this. It takes lots of reading, squeezing, writing and then editing. How? Really nice thread, one of the most informative weekly posts on this subreddit. I just wanted to point out the fact that Tata Motors has launched 2 more cars between Nano and Tiago, Zest (sedan) and Bolt(hatchback). Keep up the good work man! > Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower.

Can someone explain me why this will happen?  thank you.. this is amazing.  > One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure

And the customer's nightmare. Do you know what is the ""job"" of the ARC's right? Threaten people, beat them up, reap etc etc to get them to pay their debts. This is nice! Thanks! Upvoted! This is a progressive step in /r/india :) Great work dude! Love this thread. Awesome work mate 👍👍 Just loved it. Keep it up. What's your schedule though, coz i don't want to miss your future posts  Thank you. Upvoted A welcome return to form after a disappointing last week.

Hello /r/india I have an MBA financing related question to ask you,38,5ycazs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ycazs/hello_rindia_i_have_an_mba_financing_related/,21,"I got into Oxford's Said Business School for their MBA program, which costs a lot of money. I have been working for the last 4 years and have saved up 12 lakhs, which covers my cost of living. The tuition is insane (40 lakhs). I've contacted Prodigy finance, that disburses loans to MBA students. ATK where I work refused to sponsor my tuition.  
My father informed me that he may support my living expenses, but he does not want to finance my tuition since he wants to use the money towards his own business.  
I want to know how I'm supposed to secure funding. Dont want to bank on the academic excellence scholarships at Oxford.  
Do Indian banks give money to MBA students going abroad? Which banks do? What if I have no collateral?  
 
Profile: I scored 800 in GMAT and have 87% from Mumbai University Bcom from Jai Hind. Ive worked in ATK for the last 4 years. 
  
",MBAfinancehelpIndia," 800 GMAT and only 1 admit, and no scholarship? 

Where else did you apply? 

Look here as well: https://www.gyandhan.com/ 800 in the GMAT? Damn that's amazing. I'd wait to hear what sort of scholarship you get before deciding on a funding option. Check if Saïd has a need-based scholarship option, but honestly you should get something for academic excellence. Once you have that information, then you'll know how much you need. If you have 12 and your dad is offering 10, then you need about 30L more to finance your MBA (assuming 0 scholarship). 

Private banks have mostly stopped giving education loans. One exception is HDFC, which finances education through a company called Credila. However, for any non-US MBA courses, they will require collateral/security. State banks disburse educational loans, but they have a soft limit of 20 lakhs, but this can be increased based on requirement. Once you have a final number you'd need to borrow, build a relationship with someone from State Bank of India and walk them through your requirement. In cases where credit history is good and risk is low, they can disburse loans without collateral. 

Prodigy is also an option, but they take a few months to verify your credit score here in India and disburse the loan. On the plus side... No payments until after the course and no collateral. 

All the best!  >Do Indian banks give money to MBA students going abroad 

You will get the loan but its a lot of jhanjat and paper work. Start ASAP. 

Max loan for foreign education is 25 L? When I went it was 20 L so looked pointless. 

The collaterals will be your fathers. 

All banks do. Public banks be better. You scored 800 in GMAT ? AT Kearney ? Dont settle for Said - wait for INSEAD. You will get in .. You can PM me. INSEAD alum who was in a similar scenario and got funding from Prodigy and a Scholarship.  What about placements? Have you contacted anyone how is the job market there? Do companies sponsor visa for foreign students? Upto what period you can stay there without a job? 

40 lakh INR comes to ~49000 GBP. Salary of an associate in Mckinsy at London office is ~80000 GBP. So it would be better to do an ROI. 

Lot of people take loans from prodigy. Its good. In fact, it was started by people from INSEAD. 

Also, contact school officials if they can give a rebate. In US, many a times business school give scholarships and rebates.  Contact citi bank. They give loans upto 50 lakhs.  800 on GMAT !!!!
Fab score dude ...
Since u have got in Oxford it will definitely have a good ROI.
Its better to convince your father rather than taking loan investment in education is better than investing in business and of course you wont have the pressure of mounting interest of loand given that the mba program lasts less than 2 years.
Try credila they give out loans with and without collateral @ ~13% interest.
Since u have got into a good school i dont think getting a loan would be a problem except the paperwork​.
All the best mahn !
Keep us updated :)

Also check out
/R/mba Fuck my life, 800 on a GMAT! Why aren't you going to the American B-schools? You may have better opportunities to get a scholarship/financial aid over there.

Indian banks are a lot of hassle. I tried and failed. They made me run around for a month before saying I can't get a loan. And this was when all my paperwork/collateral/credit & tax history were fine. They had given me a loan approval (disbursement?) letter and behaved as if they had done me a favour.  800! Wow! Good Luck with your MBA. You could have got a near full ride at a few of the M7s with that profile. Why just INSEAD and SAID if I may ask? Wifey used HDFC's  security in lieu of her fixed deposits to get loan from BNP for her studies at INSEAD. She pledged her securities in India, and HDFC gave a guarantee to BNP ( for a 3% fee) to issue the loan. I don't know how you will get thru no collateral.
I came to know about a couple of crowdfunding platforms and initiatives such as Prodigy ( in US) which helped candidates with difficulties in accessing financing - you may want to search on that. Great GMAT score! I would suggest you to look for alternate sources of scholarships also along with Said Business School scholarships. There are many external scholarships which are not dependent upon schools that you have applied & the application process also remains separate.
I could find information on many of these scholarships at:
https://www.collegedice.com/scholarship/all/
Some of these are specific to Indian students:
https://www.collegedice.com/scholarshipdetails/Aga+Khan+Foundation/415/
https://www.collegedice.com/scholarshipdetails/J.N.+Tata+Endowment+/431/
https://www.collegedice.com/scholarshipdetails/The+Inlaks+Foundation+Scholarships/376/
https://www.collegedice.com/scholarshipdetails/Asian+Development+bank+-+Japan+scholarship+program/3/

You should also look for scholarships for International students & also specifically targeting asian or south-asian students.

I am sure you would be able to find some scholarship that will help you finance your MBA.

Last week in the Indian Parliament #3 (May 09 to May 13),190,4jko0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4jko0k/last_week_in_the_indian_parliament_3_may_09_to/,37,"I have good news! 

The Lok Sabha functioned without even a *single minute* of adjournment during business. This was only the third session in the history of the universe when a Lok Sabha session functioned oh-so-smoothly. 

I will let the Speaker of the House Sumitra Mahajan explain it:

[ZERO ADJOURMENTS PEEPAL!](http://imgur.com/CNmZHO9)

Hello /r/India,

In this edition of Last Week in Indian Parliament, we talk about the great ‘Pillar Fight’; quorum of the house and the absence of it; and how Rajya Sabha turned into a nukkad Ganpati Utsav culture day. 

I also wanted to write about: ""The Enforcement of Security Interest and (*takes a deep breath*) Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (AMENDMENT) Bill, 2016 to amend the Securitisation and (*takes another deep breath*) Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 a.k.a the SARFAESI Act""

But then I realized it requires a whole new post.

So let's get right into it!

#“Hon’ble Members…”

#“Absent, Madam.”
___

The Budget session adjourned sine-dine on Friday for Rajya Sabha and on Wednesday for Lok Sabha. I can’t even count how many times during this session I heard the quorum bell ringing shrill, begging the members to come inside the house and let the business continue.

For the uninitiated, quorum is the minimum number of members that have to be present for the business in the house to be conducted. Under article 100(3) of the Constitution, for both houses of Parliament and State Assemblies, the quorum is one-tenth of the total strength of the house. So basically, in Lok Sabha, 53 members need to be present in order to let the house function.

Here’s the funny thing though, the quorum is considered only if a member present in the house brings it to the notice of the speaker. There is a certain ‘young’ Congress MP who can be spotted constantly counting the number of members present (I can’t name this person, for obvious reasons). The moment he sees that the members are below 53, he screams, “MADAMMMM! QUORUMMMM!?” 

Then he sits back with a smirk on his face as the speaker sighs, halts the business and the quorum bell rings.

**Fun fact**: There are two different sounding (and extremely shrill) quorum bells for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. They can be heard throughout the premises and all conversations are cut short. There are separate sounding bells for division of the house calls too. The members are supposed to rush into the house when these bells ring. Super irritating, if you ask me. If it were upto me, I would use the following as quorum bells:

[Lok Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W2jONIjrM0)

[Rajya Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg)

**Fun Fact 2:** The Quorum bell was rung when the Finance Bill and Aadhaar Bill were being considered. It was rung multiple times when the debate on Water Crisis was underway. Gives you an idea about the state of affairs.

**Why was the Lok Sabha adjourned early?**

Because the government didn’t seem to have any legislative business left. The Lok Sabha was supposed to continue till May 13, but was shut down on May 11. 

After the Uttarakhand Appropriation bill was passed, there was nothing left to do. So, as an afterthought, the discussion on drought and water crisis continued for two days. Since the session is coinciding with five state elections, a lot of members were absent from the house. I don’t recall AIADMK MPs participating even in a single debate this session. So basically, maintaining quorum was becoming a big issue and probably that’s why they decided to adjourn Lok Sabha early.

#Pillar Fight!
___

There has been a silent battle raging between our Judiciary, Legislature and Executive. In the past one month, there are many seemingly disconnected events that happened, but if you look closer you will see a tiny silk thread running through them all. Last week, during a debate on Uttarakhand appropriating bill, the Pillar Fight came to the forefront. The story is quite convoluted, so hold on to your [tin-foil hats](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/69852/3449330-tumblr_loq5o7rd4n1qzl8s1o1_400.gif)!

**The Battle of Uttarakhand**

The Uttarakhand ‘crisis’ came to a conclusion last week after Harish Rawat won the floor test, got on to his horse and [galloped away into the sunset](https://67.media.tumblr.com/ff9fd687b5bb1a3256eef3428074b7bb/tumblr_nytqw4xu7G1u9i37so1_400.gif). The floor test was ordered by the Supreme Court and it was to take place without the speaker of the 70 member assembly conducting it. The whole hand-raising ceremony was recorded and the video was sent to SC for verification. News Channels were showing Rawat praying to god almighty for saving his seat and, in the process, getting a lot of sympathy from his voters.

(**PERSONAL POLITICAL COMMENT:** I won’t be surprised if, come February, he goes around the state, addressing election rallies and screaming “MODI TRIED TO CONQUER US! BUT WE FRIKKIN WON!!” The ‘outsider invaded our land’ pitch can be quite compelling. Remember Independence Day? No no, not the Indian Freedom Struggle, I was talking about the movie where aliens attack and humans win and then everyone makes out in the end and are all happy and shit. Same thing. So, well done BJP!)


**Uttarakhand Appropriation Bill, 2016** 

>“Speaker is the roxxx. He/she is Supreme”

>~ Indian National Congress


Before the crucial floor test happened on Tuesday, the government of the day seemed to be in a weird sort of hurry to get the state’s budget passed in Parliament on Monday. I’m yet to figure out why but the Finance Minister, in his opening statement, said that this was being passed so that the state can continue with its expenditure for the next four months. He said, if the budget is not passed by the Assembly, the state won’t be allowed to spend any money.

[Jaitley Logic](http://imgur.com/RCstARp)

The president’s rule (under Rule 356) was imposed on Uttarakhand on 27th March 2016, a day before the floor test was supposed to happen. Since then, the assembly has been in a state of ‘suspended animation’. The central government was of the opinion that the Speaker of the Uttarakhand Assembly did not conduct the house as per the book, that he let the state budget pass even though the Uttarakhand Government didn’t have the required votes.

[What if the Speaker is being a complete ass?](http://imgur.com/rX785ih)

Members of INC argued here that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) has a right to conduct the house as he/she pleases. They also held the belief that the Court (Pillar of Judiciary) has a right to question the decision of the President (Pillar of Executive) too. On, 21st April, the Nainital High Court had scrapped the President’s Rule in Uttarakhand, thus challenging the President. 

**Aadhaar Bill, 2016**

> “Speaker is the suxxx. He/she is NOT Supreme.”

> ~ Indian National Congress

Now here's the weird part. 

Incidentally, in case of the Aadhaar Bill, 2016, the Indian National Congress has challenged the Lok Sabha Speaker’s decision to classify the Aadhaar Bill as a money bill. Jairam Ramesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, the hearing for which is scheduled soon. I have been talking about this case for a while now, so you can read more about it [here](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking).

In this case, INC has argued that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) is *not* supreme and her decision can be challenged by the Court (Pillar of Judiciary). 

I know I know. It’s utterly confusing. It’s also rather amusing how INC can speak in favour *and* against the same bloody thing. Takes some talent to pull it off.

**So which pillar wins?**

Zoom out a little. 

Imagine these three pillars, side by side. 

The height of the Legislative Pillar is decided by a party’s strength in the Parliament. At the moment, the Pillar of Legislature is standing tall (#MudiRoxx). As with the case with every party in power at the center, they try to find ways and means to infringe and cut down the powers of the other two pillars. 

*In the case of Uttarakhand Assembly*, Legislature was taken over by Executive and both of these pillars were shot down by the Judiciary.

*In the case of Aadhaar Bill*, the Judiciary is challenging the Legislature by questioning its highest functionary, the speaker. Since the Bill has been assented to by the President, they also end up challenging the Executive. If the SC rules that Aadhaar is #NotAMoneyBill and strike it down, it gives a decision against the Executive too.

This battle was underlined by Arun Jaitley with a singular suggestion to the Speaker of Lok Sabha, that if the Supreme Court summons her in the Aadhaar case: **She should ignore them!**

[Madam Speaker, ignore. Just ignore.](http://imgur.com/Lf89cDo)

[Obligatory song dedicated to Mr Jaitley](https://youtu.be/1M8vei3L0L8?t=26s)

The Pillar Fight rages on and much popcorn has been consumed in the process. I am single-handedly making Act II profitable.

I leave you with an interesting comment made by Kalikesh Singh Deo during the Uttarakhand debate:

#Rajya Sabha Association prijhents “Bye Bye Honourable Members Mohatsav”
___

53 members retired from the Rajya Sabha last week after serving 6 years in the house, being awesome and stuff. Prime Minister Modi gave a [farewell speech] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k-HZIMs9xc) on the occasion, which is worth giving a watch (HINDI ALERT).

Before you go further, let me say, **“No. The BJP will not get majority in the Rajya Sabha by 2019.”**

[Here’s a good article explaining why](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/in-this-term-modi-govt-will-never-have-the-numbers-in-rajya-sabha/)
___
**Psst... Umm… Noob question: How are Rajya Sabha Members elected?**

*Don’t be embarrassed if you don’t know! Let me give you a simple rundown of how this whole shindig works. If you already know, feel free to skip this part.*

To put it simply, Rajya Sabha (aka State Council) Members are elected by the people you elect for state assemblies. There is a proportional voting system in place which decides how many members from different political parties will represent a state in the upper house. 

IRL, the party boss decides who gets a Rajya Sabha ticket. The majority political party in the assembly gets to send more members than other parties. The number of RS seats per state are decided according to the population of the state. A member elected for Rajya Sabha serves a term of six years.

The Rajya Sabha, unlike the Lok Sabha, is *never* dissolved. 1/3rd Members of RS resign every two years making the house a perpetual entity. [Here](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/memberstatewise.aspx) is a list of the seats held by each state, present vacancies and other such details.
___

The Rajya Sabha bid a tearful adieu to retiring members who were given a chance to express their emotions. They did express their emotions and how! I have done the painstaking job of going through the debates and pulling out interesting bits which turned the Rajya Sabha into a *nukkad sabha*. 

Much fun was had!

*(Most of this was in Hindi, so for the benefit of my non-hindi speaking [comarades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NJbxEgf3Uo), I will try to translate it in a crude manner.)*

- Ram Gopal Yadav (Samajwadi Party) [recalled an anecdote](http://imgur.com/qjtuXlz): Two American politicians were sitting together discussing the relevance of the Senate (Upper House). The Senator amongst them was sipping tea, he simply blew on the tea and looked back at the other. “What does this mean?” asked the noob amongst the two. The Senator replied, “The Upper house cools down the decisions taken by the lower house. It’s like cooling tea so you don’t burn your tongue.”

- SS Roy (Trinamool Congress) [broke into a Mukesh song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDbwkKDWJ-4), explaining (in poetic terms) how members of Rajya Sabha will come back if the High Command wishes them to do so.

- Chandan Mitra (Bharatiya Janata Party) [recalled the lines of Faiz Ahmed Faiz](http://imgur.com/mUekcBY):

>“You know and I know,

> Both of our paths separate today,

> Even if you travel far, do remember me,

> Never say goodbye, Never say goodbye.”

- Dr KP Ramalingam (AIADMK) [quoted from Thirukkural](http://imgur.com/vFrXBVG), an ancient Tamil epic.

- The Subramanianator trolled V Hanumantha Rao (Indian National Congress) [even during his farewell speech](http://imgur.com/UK5eV4m). You gotta love that guy!

- VP Singh Badnore (BJP) [quoted John Keats’s “Ode to Melancholy”](http://imgur.com/uqxQoL8).



- Chairman Hamid Ansari (The Coolest Man Alive) [trolled](http://imgur.com/Pf9anKg) Tarun Vijay (BJP) by asking him to use his immense rhetorical skills and confine the speech to three minutes. Jaya Bachchan joined the trolling my asking members who speak too much to conclude their speech in two lines. #AnsariRocks 

- Tarun Vijay [roared back](http://imgur.com/4ibVzoL) with a *sher*. (#SelfThoo)

> “Let us do full enemy-enemy, but keep some space,

> If we ever become friends, we must not feel shame.”

- KC Tyagi (JDU) was in [full stand-up mode](http://imgur.com/mXJQv9Z). He started off by telling Ansari that he is going back to being a wild-child. “I will break Section 144 and do long duration discussions in Unparliamentary language,” he said. **“LOL,”** said everyone else.

How is it that J B Diamond, Forever Precious Diamond and Winsome Diamond are on the list of defaulters? Does it have anything to do with the performance of the industry in the recent years or is it just mere coincidence? 
",arre_yaar," Diamonds arriving in bulk from other countries are difficult to value. Uncut stones, finished stones, low quality stones, zirconium, and glass fakes are difficult to be examined individually for tax by officials. As a result a simple shipment can be valued at tens/hundreds of millions of dollars. What easier way to make money than create fake import bills and send hundreds of crores abroad?

I am stuck in a bad situation and I was hoping you could help me by guiding me on what to do or pointing to someone who could maybe guide me

**What I need help with** : Choosing a path to land a job as soon as possible

**What my problem is :** Was an entrepreneur for 3 years - I have only generalist skills, no employable skills. And I dont have money saved up. 

Some histroy -

I'm an Engineer with an MBA in Banking and Finance [Finished mba  2 years back from a top-12 college in India]. Right out of college I landed a job as a business analyst at a good IT firm [not Infosys/tcs etc] but I didn’t join that company and instead went into the family business.


Since  early 2014, I have been working for my 3 family businesses and done all sorts of general-ish stuff [One's a new school, another an industrial equipment manufacturing factory and the the third is a construction firm making residential apartments]


* in 2014, Worked towards planning, execution, purchase related stuff of construction of our school - involved dealing with suppliers, contractors etc


* In 2015, Worked in day to day planning, execution, management of our industrial manufacturing unit. Did lot of touring for this, to build better relationship with our clients and suppliers. I have experience of B2B marketing, building and maintaining client and supplier relationships etc]


* In 2016, in the construction firm, I oversaw and completed a small residential project and involved in a lot of aspects. Ive gone abroad in exhibitions and done B2C marketing, involved in sales and marketing department, designing/tweaking online ad campaigns, decision making for local sales channels like hoardings etc, supervision of day to day work on construction site etc. I believe I have a baisc working knowledge of the construction industry now.

However, now I am looking for a job since I haven’t earned anything in the past 3 years. **I cant take money from my family now due to a complicated situation. I am completely on my own** ,  There are no future earning prospects from the business for me, and my only way to survive is by taking up a job. Unfortunately, I don’t have any employable skills. I just don’t know what to do.


**I need a path to a job.** What is something I can do to land a job as quickly as possible. Can a person like me even get a job now ? I’m age 27 .


I was looking at 3 fields, but all involve a  lengthy studying time/skill acquisition time and less chance of getting a job – and time is something I don’t have : study finance to land a financial analyst job , study applied statistics to land a data analytics job – or somehow try to apply for business analyst job [by refreshing my domain knowledge from MBA]. I see a very very slim chance of me getting a job in these fields

Another thing I was thinking of was either take coaching for 10th standard Science/Maths or teach for MBA Entrance like CAT/GMAT etc. But how would I go about getting hired by a coaching center ?

Please help me.

tl;dr - help an unemployable, penniless ex-entrepreneur land a job.",qzyxqzyx," One ready option for most people is sales job. Banks always have requirement for sales job. So does several several companies. It is hard work and would involve lot of patience and communication skills. But the pay off is good. And there is growth if you perform well.


 With your credentials its not going to be tough at all, why are you panicking? Your Situation is not bad... You have passed out of a Top MBA School of the country so definitely, you will have a network of Friends and classmates who are now working at good places, you can forward your CV to them. References work like anything!

You have loads of experience and Entrepreneurship is in the trend, Employers see Entrepreneurs as a multi-talented resource for them. Another +

You will definitely get a job.

I am myself an Entrepreneur and have also passed out from a Top B-school of the country!!



 Activate your alum network and ask anybody who is in a good position to help. Sales/ marketing. You have people / inter personal skills to sail through a few jobs.  [deleted] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4V3Mo61fJM OP hit as many references as you can. Talk to relatives,friends, anyone and everyone you know. 
Getting a job through reference is the easiest way forward. Also be flexible on salary.   in all you did 3 jobs without salary ... now time to work for competition :) you already have contacts in respective field  You have good project management skills, see if you can get a certificate through pmi.org. I know it is a bit pricey, but getting a PMP certification is a good start. 

On the coaching side, there are hundreds of places offering services, though it does depend on the city you are located in. If you are in one of the major ones, like Bangalore, meet with them and show them your scores, perhaps they may get interested. You sound like a perfect fit for an operations job. Unless you are really interested in being an analyst, I'd concentrate on finding operations roles. They pay pretty well also since they come with lots of responsibility and lots of people to manage as well as relationships with vendors.",Business/Finance,2016-11-30 14:32:55

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

Millions of frustrated math students in schools across India have complained a million times about how nobody is ever going to use pythagorean theorems in real life. And how schools should teach something that people actually use in real life, like how to pay your taxes. Well, the Income Tax Department has taken that complaint to heart. As part of an effort to create a responsible taxpaying society, tax officials are set to [visit](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/i-t-officials-set-to-give-moral-science-lessons-in-schools/articleshow/53164515.cms) schools armed with powerpoints and statistics to teach kids all about taxes including how black money and tax evasion harms the economy.

Previous week's thread : [Indian Startups Last Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/513183/indian_startups_this_week/)",indianstartupguy," Thanks man. Really amazing what you're doing. is it really that easy to raise funds ? I have really great ideas. 

How do i start?  +1, Awesome work man. Just a suggestion could you have each post link to the previous week's post (a-la ""Weekly Coders"" thread)? Makes it really easy to read the ""back issues"" incase you miss out on a couple of weeks.  I will always upvote this. Thank you enlighten me with what happens in the Indian startups Ecosystem. Keep it going   

Just a suggestion. Can you even include a list of probable startup funding being raise by VC to invest in startups. Not sure if it is quite frequent to happen every week but it would be good to know.  [browze.co](https://browze.co/) is a community noticeboard sort of platform. I am simply trying to solve the space / time problem with location aware, real time activities around wherever you are. 

The apps got updated yesterday night. I still have a long time to go. I am self funding it, and if my advertisement agreements come through, I intend to continue upon the same path.

**Pandering To The Base**

Every politician does it. From the Donald in the US to Modi in India, it’s a political science lesson that crosses borders. As much as we parade the “developing-nation” tag around, India’s economy is still heavily dependant on agriculture as it employs almost two-thirds of the nation’s people. And these farmers also constitute Modi’s base and naturally, his government needs to pander to them before the forth-coming state elections. After a union budget that was largely seen as pro-farmer by earmarking almost $826 million (₹5,524 crore) for crop insurance plans, the government might play two more cards to appease the backbone of the economy. One, officials said last week that they are considering imposing a [penalty](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-crop-insurance-idUSL3N16U22P) on delaying of claim settlements for crop insurance. That’s when you buy insurance and if the rains don’t come in and your crops fail, you get paid a settlement. Two, the government is likely to extend the the current 25% wheat import tax which expires in March to continue [beyond](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-wheat-duty-idINKCN0WN1H7) March. The tax was imposed to shield domestic wheat farmers from cheap imports. Wasn’t exactly effective since wheat output in 2015 was down 10% from 2014, despite the tax.


**The Great Indian Addiction**

Indian people are addicted. It’s not a drug, gambling or internet addiction. It’s an addiction to gold. Gold imports make up a quarter of India’s trade deficit because we import almost 10 lakh kgs of gold annually. Billionaire Warren Buffett says about gold: “It doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you.”  Clearly, Indian people think that Buffett uncle doesn’t know anything about gold. Rehabilitating the Indian people from this addiction can be hard but the government is trying. Recently, it introduced a 1% excise duty on imported gold jewellry. How did that go down? Jewellers went on an indefinite strike which was called off last week after [assurances](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-strike-idINKCN0WM01T) that excise department officials won’t harass jewellers. The government also started a campaign to monetize the privately owned horde of Indian gold to cut down on imports. How has that worked out? The scheme only managed to attract 0.015% of the estimated horde of gold that is currently in family lockers and temple vaults. There was some golden news on that front last week as the iconic 200-year-old [Siddhivinayak](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-siddhihvinayak-temple-idINKCN0WK1ZF) temple in Mumbai announced its participation in the scheme.

**Because Karma Is A Bitch**

Petty sabotage and backstabbing isn’t just limited to undercover spies and Indian politics anymore. The corporates are adopting these strategies as well. Last week, Uber filed a lawsuit at the Delhi High Court against its biggest Indian competitor, Ola. The lawsuit accuses Ola of creating 90,000 fake Uber accounts and using them to book over 400,000 rides, only to be cancelled at the last [moment](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11292310/uber-ola-lawsuit-india-fake-rides-lyft). Classic prank by Ola, right? Except Uber claims that Ola did this to disrupt its operations and frustrate its drivers. And Uber would know that because it has been accused of doing the exact same thing to its biggest US competitor, Lyft. Two years ago, Lyft accused Uber of booking and cancelling over 5,000 rides using fake accounts that were traced back to Uber employees. If true, Ola will only have taken a page from Uber’s own playbook. If you’re a betting person, be sure to put your money on Uber - that company’s got deep pockets and can drag this out as long as it takes. It recently declared $1 billion (₹6,688 crore) in annual profits from it’s [top 30](http://www.newsweek.com/uber-profits-elsewhere-support-sustainable-spending-china-ceo-440705) cities alone. To be fair, they also said they were sustaining huge losses in China where the company holds a 30% market share.

**Auto Engines Are The New Moon Landing**

69th Richest Indian on the famous Forbes Rich-list and the co-founder of Infosys, Nandan Nilekani is known for investing in startups that focus on big, transformative ideas. In his investment portfolio is Team Indus, a company that aims to land a rover on the moon and Systemantics, a company that focuses on robots. Last week, Nilekani made his [biggest](http://thetechportal.in/2016/03/24/sedemac-mechatronics-funding/) startup investment yet in a company called Sedemac Mechatronics. What’s bigger than futuristic robots and landing on the moon? Time travel, perhaps? No, apparently, it’s building small engines and powertrains for auto companies. Nilekani led the latest round of funding in Sedemac which summed up to a total of $7.5 million (₹50 crore). Sedemac counts the big boys of the auto industry like Tata Motors, Mahindra Group, Ashok Leyland as its clients and was started by an engineering professor at IIT-B with a couple of fellow IITians.

**The Chinese Dragon Wants In On India**

The “Big Three” of e-commerce in India - Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon - will soon become the “Big Four” with the entry of Alibaba, the chinese e-commerce giant in India. Officials from the company that is poised to [surpass](http://www.businessinsider.in/Alibaba-on-course-to-become-worlds-top-retailer/articleshow/51507633.cms) the world’s biggest retailer, Walmart and claim that tag for itself, said last week that Alibaba was looking to expand its presence in India. It is looking to directly enter the online retail segment later this year. Run by China’s richest person, Jack Ma, the company already owns 40% of Paytm and 4% of Snapdeal. Are Indian e-commerce companies coming together like brothers-in-arms to fight off competition from this foreign entity? Of course no. The Indians didn’t unite when the British literally invaded and aren’t going to do that now with the Chinese either. In fact, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal and his Snapdeal counterpart Kunal Bahl already found themselves in a war of words on [Twitter](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/flipkart-s-sachin-bansal-takes-jibe-at-alibaba-s-india-entry-116032600040_1.html) over Alibaba’s planned expansion in India. Alibaba, which still conjures images of forty thieves in one’s imagination, may tie up with the [Tatas](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-21/news/71705366_1_digital-india-alibaba-group-chairman-cyrus-mistry) to launch its online retail business as a joint-venture. This is because FDI regulations still don’t allow foreign companies to sell directly to Indian consumers, which is what Alibaba wants to do. Amazon, the US ambassador to the industry, merely connects buyers and sellers and doesn’t sell itself.

**Oli Gets Oil**

Nepal’s Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli recently took a trip up north to Beijing and stumbled his way into signing an agreement with China for the supply of petroleum products to [Nepal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-nepal-idUSKCN0WP1WV). The country, which serves as a strategic buffer between India and China, adopted its first post-monarchy constitution last year. But protesters opposing the new constitution blocked trucks carrying fuel and essential goods coming from India. This five-month long “unofficial blockade” of Nepal had disastrous consequences for the Nepalese economy due to its overwhelming dependence on India. The distraught country says it now wants to import 33% of Nepal’s fuel from China in the future. Basically, after being deeply hurt by what the Indians did, Nepal is now looking for some quick rebound action from the Chinese. Indian officials, however, are far from alarmed that Nepal is trying to move away from the Indian sphere of influence. Why? Because there is this big huge chunk of rock called the Himalayas between Nepal and China.

It’s a far cry from it’s previous 77% market share but it’s back on the top of the charts. The ban imposed by the food regulator shot Maggi down. But Maggie didn’t fall.

How does this affect anyone (except the one's who had their gold deposited at the jwellers' for modification/cleaning etc)? Honest question. > “It doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you.”

But maintains its value across time and geography. Not the same with stock markets, real estate etc etc. Gold won't jump up or down much, but will keep at a steady pace. I think it is because indians are risk averse, not addicted to gold. i dont think uber has even 10% of the market share  in china considering it isnt even in any of the other cities except beijing and shanghai, Didi kuadi(Chinese uber) has much more of a spread and influence and isn't an american company, and if Alibaba enters with a e-commerce juggernaut like taobao i don't think the big 3  could realistically survive.  Safe to say infibeam IPO was a spectacular dud? You know, I know its not ""economic"" news per se, but you should talk about the down rounds that are a coming to the Indian market.

Should I move to India? Advice needed.,11,5zifa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5zifa2/should_i_move_to_india_advice_needed/,24,"My parents and I (only child) live in Thailand. I joined my family business of loose diamonds. I realized I do not enjoy selling diamonds. I want to move to India. I have a BBA in Finance. Should I move to work in India (preferrably Mumbai)? I understand finding a job will be very tough, and the starting salary will be peanuts, but hopefully I can move up the ladder with hardwork. My dad will not support me financially and I do not have much savings. As it is, I do not make much currently, as Im not passionate about what I do. Also, I would love to settle down in India in the future. 

Should I move to India? Or things are not as rosy and easy as I assume them to be? Any advice is appreciated. Are the career opportunities good? Is BBA in Finance enough to get me my first job? 

I am also planning to self-teach web development and move to India mid next year. Currently, I am 22 years old.

Note: Finding a job in Thailand for a non-Thai citizen is very tough. Also, I have posted about my situation here before but for a different advice.",nosleepnomore," Bro, you're asking in the wrong place. This sub is full of people who hate India and love the West. Any answer you get here is going to be biased at best. So don't ask any life-altering questions here.

My opinion - India is neither as rosy nor as gloomy as portrayed. It all depends on what kind of work you're doing. There are opportunities to be found and lost both. I would suggest you start applying for jobs, and see what you get. Generally, people here do a masters after BBA before getting a job, and they usually get a good job after that.

If you're thinking of getting into software, India is the place to be right now in Asia. We are having some teething troubles, but we should be sailing smooth in a couple of years. If you want to make a career in software, it's either the US or India. Without England, Europe's population is too homogenous to make a serious long term career there.  Are you of Indian origin? No.dont go to india...go to a good european country Uh, moving from Thailand to India is probably a good idea...  

I cant say about the job aspect, but as long as you get an equivalent job (Bombay is craaaazy expensive) India offers a better deal than Thailand in terms of quality of life and civil liberties(Atleast compared to the Thailand I saw as a tourist)  i think moving to india can substantially reduce your family's travel bill as IRC you pops loves his brother's family  more than his family.

After about 200 days, it was becoming difficult for me to keep hold of her. My finances were in ruin due to other issues so I decided to free her. I gave her the freedom to leave and patted myself on the back for freeing her.

Meanwhile, during her time as my sex-slave, she developed a Stockholm syndrome - a part of her had fallen in love with me and started to look up to me, glorify me, and imitate me.  

However, since I set her free, she hasn't been able to do well. She's not been able to find a job, not been able to create any savings, has a dysfunctional thought process, cannot execute things properly. 

But  it has been 60 days since I set her free. If she can't get her things in order in such a long time, how can anyone blame my 200 days of rape for it? 

I mean if she can't get her house in order even after 60 days, its completely her fault. A large part of her even agrees with me on this.

However, there is this small part of her brain that keeps talking about how she has PTSD from my rape. I keep telling her that this is a deluded fascist part of her brain that is making up fiction about how it could have been if I had not raped her. I mean duh, she'd have never heard of Netflix. Besides, everyone else was raping too so its not really my fault.

In any case, this fascist part of her brain talks about justice and vengeance against me for my rape. But I prefer to ignore and not talk about those old days. Sometimes I even tell her that the rape was good for her. I suggest that its best we ignore the past and build on our special relationship and continue to work together for a better future for the both of us. She agrees with me for the most part except when her fascist mindset kicks in. 

Who am I and who is she?",SerialRapistWhoAmI," [deleted] go home Britain, you are drunk. I'm sensing people don't get that this is a metaphor [deleted] You=Pizza delivery guy

She = Friend of a randian Its because you freed her but had her cut in two. Anyone living person who is split into two will suffer PTSD dude. Now they have split into three and different parts of her keep fighting for the common parts they love. You cut her up to ensure she can't live peacefully and keeps comes back to you and you can fuck her when you want. You like to keep your conquests and celebrate them every now and then. And the worst thing is you make it look like they chose to do this. I am amazed and disgusted at the same time bro! You guys are idiots.

We instead followed the soviet model which was at that time a direct opposition to the west. But we also missed our masters a bit(Stockholm syndrome?) and thus we never went full commie. Had we gone full commie, the glaring inequalities at the time of independence would have been wiped out by now - as happened in China. As a result we did not develop.

**Apple’s New China Is India**

When Steve Jobs, ex-hippie and the founder of Apple, visited India in the 1970s, he wore a lungi and [roamed](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/what-steve-jobs-did-in-india-35-years-ago-225246) barefoot. Until, of course, the Indian national disease of diarrhea cut his trip short and sent him back to the US. Fortunately for all of us, when Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, visited India last week his attire did not include a lungi and he probably drank bottled water, as is tradition for all foreign tourists in India. In between wild Bollywood parties at SRK’s house and IPL matches in Kanpur, Tim [announced](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-tim-cook-samples-bollywood-cricket-in-bid-to-woo-india-1463822223) a startup accelerator in Bengaluru and the opening of two new offices including one in Hyderabad. It wasn’t all play and no work - Tim met with businessmen like the CEOs of ICICI Bank, Vodafone India, TCS and heads of state like Prime Minister Modi, the Telangana CM and many more. But why India and why now? After reporting the first quarterly decline in sales that was largely caused due to slowing growth in China, Apple is now searching for something other than China to fuel growth for the coming decade. And Apple’s next China might just be India. Tim termed his visit to India as ‘fantastic’ but then again, he also ran into Alia Bhatt. So it’s entirely possible that his statements were laced with sarcasm.  

**The One With Trump, Brexit and India**

Britain, the former colonial master of India and more countries than you can even name, is going through an independence movement of its own. Currently, the country is a part of the European Union, a political and economic union of 28 countries in Europe. In a public vote to be held on June 23rd, Britishers will decide if the nation will stay in the European Union or get out of the European Union. All of that may be Britain’s headache but a new report out of SBI [suggests](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-brexit-can-open-up-opportunities-for-india-sbi-research-report-2212552) that even though a Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) could be terrible for Europe, it could turn out to be hugely beneficial for India since Indian companies will no longer need to follow complex trade agreements while dealing with Britain. Likewise, a former US Diplomat says a Trump presidency in the US, while [terrible](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/if-donald-trump-becomes-us-president-india-may-gain-at-chinas-expense-heres-why/articleshow/52380459.cms) for China and Pakistan (...not to mention Mexico) might actually turn out to be great for India as ~~Donald Trump~~ Dear Leader’s foreign policies are likely to shift the balance of power in Asia in favour of India. The word to describe what you’re feeling right now is schadenfreude - taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Trust me, *I know words. I have the best [words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T-Eo0j092Q)*

**The Banking Bloodbath**

With the whole bad loans crisis being shoved in everyone’s faces, it’s no surprise that banks are feeling the heat. Saddled with a ton of losses caused by increasing net non-performing assets (the fancy term for bad loans), conditions are becoming dire. A host of smaller banks reported earnings last week and it’s not good. If you have a phobia of falling bank profits, turn away now and seek professional help because it’s about to get gruesome. Alright, [here](http://www.livemint.com/Money/1MpJ5uNbQXhacOWKTo3PWJ/PSU-banks-shares-fall-after-weak-earnings.html) we go: Dena Bank reported a loss of ₹326 crore, Allahabad Bank reported a loss of ₹581 crore, Central Bank of India reported a loss of ₹898 crore, UCO Bank reported a loss of ₹1,715 crore and Syndicate Bank [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/syndicate-bank-q4-loss-at-rs-2158cr-provisions-jump-3-fold_6677621.html) a loss of ₹2,158 crore. Going for the silver medal is Bank of Baroda with a loss of ₹3,230 crore, the second highest loss in the history of Indian banking. And now, for the gold medal, the worst loss in the history of Indian banking ever was reported at a record-breaking ₹5,367 crore by *drumroll* Punjab National Bank. It feels good to have found the rock-bottom at last. At least now, there is nowhere to go but up. That’s what investors in bank stocks are saying to themselves so they can sleep well at night. Let’s hope for their sake that we don’t find a new bottom in the next quarter.

**|| || || > | | | | | |**

So you might’ve heard: The banking industry is in a bit of a tight spot. There haven’t been any bankruptcies (phew) yet. But there’s blood on the streets. And the only way to patch the wound is to stick together in times of trouble. State Bank of India, one of the largest banks in India, [proposed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-bank-of-india-says-no-talks-on-merging-with-any-other-lenders-1408323) a plan to stick together and merge with its 5 associate banks: State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore plus the newly created Bharatiya Mahila Bank. If merged, the combined bank will become a banking behemoth with 50 crore customers. And behemoths don’t bleed easy. Taking cue, the government is also urging UCO Bank, Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank (all of whom have reported losses) to find themselves a relatively well off bank and merge their losses away. Playing the merger game is tricky business. You don’t want your merger to be like Romeo and Juliet. Sure, they made history but they both died in the end. You want your merger to be like Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. One that can live happily ever after.

props to you man. this is great writing. you should pitch this to the Economist. They'd love it That's one of the most helpful posts, I have seen on Reddit. Keep it up!!! EU is not a political union, it is an economic union though.

In economic union you have monetary union in shape of ECB.

EU is walking towards political union and when it will be a political union then its working will be somewhat same as United States of America (USA). Excellent as always

-your dear friend in America far from me to be pedantic but the word ""extradited"" sticks out like a store in the Mallya story. Actually, the govt requested that Mallya be ""Deported"" which is a quick and painless procedure. This was declined as the UK has a policy of not deporting anyone who has landed there legally. The British suggested that if India requested initiation of an extradition procedure, they will consider it. I don't know if India did start extradition but in any case it is a long-drawn process with lots of paperwork and legalese. Was waiting for this.

**A Government of India Original**

The stage has been set - on one side, we have the world renowned economist, Raghuram Rajan and on the other side, we have the new MP on the block, Subramanian Swamy. It’s a battle of wits. It’s a battle of politics. But to find out if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI, or if Swamy successfully sends Rajan back to the US - watch out for season 2, coming this August. Apparently, the government is going to keep everyone [waiting](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-to-take-call-on-raghuram-rajan-s-rbi-term-extension-in-august-2215544) till the 11th hour and only decide if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI in August, a month before his current term expires. Just when you thought you were getting into the show, they drop a huge cliffhanger and make you wait for the next season. Don’t you hate it when that happens? We already have the protagonist and the antagonist for this plot - might as well add in some supporting characters: Uday Kotak - promoter of the Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Adi Godrej - head of the Godrej group have endorsed Rajan for a second term. Even a poll of top CEOs from corporate India found overwhelming support for Rajan. So everyone wants a second term for Rajan. But that’s the thing with season premiers - they tend to take very unexpected plot twists.


**Another Round of Startup ~~Funding~~ Troubles**

Zimply, PepperTap, Stayzilla, TinyOwl, Swiggy… these words don’t sound like words at all. And until a few years ago, they were just a bunch of typos. But today, they are all venture-funded startups that recruit from some of the best talent pools in the country, the IIMs. Or at least they used to, until the startup boom turned into a balloon that’s constantly trying to run away from thorns. In the recent round of troubles, officials in charge of placements at IIMs are annoyed with startups deferring joining dates and marking down pay packages. To take the classic example of what happened with Flipkart, the company told all new recruits from IIM-A to sit back and relax for now and join the company in December instead of joining next month. And in exchange for the lost pay which can often run into several lakhs, Flipkart will bump up the signing bonus by a sweet ₹1.5 lakh. Now, the authorities at IIM-A are not happy with [these](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/iim-ahmedabad-asks-flipkart-to-address-placement-issue-2819413/) shenanigans at all, since a lot of students have loans they need to pay back. And have warned startups that there could be consequences. Moreover, what if the students take up writing in their free time till December? India cannot afford another Chetan Bhagat right now.

**A Change of Plans**

Last August, the RBI gave approvals to 11 companies to set up payments banks. The 11 companies are some of the who’s who of the business world - Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla, Vodafone, Airtel, IDFC Bank, Tech Mahindra and many more. And then there was also the Indian Department of Posts. But what in god’s name is a payments bank, I hear you ask. A payments bank is just a normal bank, except it can’t give out loans. And before you ask the next most obvious question, they make money from fees and commissions. But increasingly, the process of chasing after the RBI to obtain these approvals is starting to resemble dogs chasing after cars. They wouldn’t know what to do if they ever caught one. Now, three entities that received approvals including IDFC Bank and Tech Mahindra are [dropping](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/tech-mahindra-drops-out-of-payments-bank-race-841548) plans to ever start a payments bank. The primary reason given for the change of plans is that competing with 11 other deep pocketed companies will result into wafer-thin profits which doesn’t make business sense. In short, simple capitalism at work. After all, chasing after things we don’t have, only to realize that we don’t want it when we do get our hands on it - is a timeless classic that is rooted deep inside all of us.

**Pakistan Is Listing Everything**

In 2013, Pakistan, our dear neighbour to the west, was about to Greece the place up by defaulting on its loans. You didn’t hear much about this because the IMF swooped in and saved the day by bailing Pakistan out to the tune of $6.7 billion. But IMF money rarely comes with no strings attached. As part of the bailout, Pakistan was required to privatize the economy by listing many of its state-owned companies on the stock exchange. Last week, the country [announced](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/world-news/pakistan-to-start-soft-marketing-state-airline-sale-in-june/263644/) that it is looking for investors as it plans to do exactly that and list over 68 companies including the Pakistan International Airlines, a bunch of steel mills and utility companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which by the way is also being listed. So if you know a friend who’s got a few million lying around - hit them up, Pakistan’s looking for investors. Or we could make a kickstarter campaign. I can kick in 50 bucks. Either way, this is definitely not Pakistan’s week. Historically, India didn’t have access to Central Asia and Afghanistan since Pakistan blocked all the land routes. But with a newly [signed](http://qz.com/690217/india-just-played-a-masterstroke-in-iran-to-reinforce-its-regional-soft-power-status-in-asia/) contract with Iran, India can potentially bypass Pakistan and trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia through a sea route to Iran and a rail link from there on.

* As a net importer of oil, India has raked in millions as oil prices nosedived from a high of $100 to a low of $30. But every coin has two sides - and sadly, this isn’t that double-headed coin Jai used in Sholay. In real life, the good comes with the bad. Some 7 million Indians work abroad in the oil-rich Gulf countries that have fallen on bad times, and more and more are being forced to come home. Remittances from Indians working abroad [slumped](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-remittances-idINKCN0YG2OE) 27% to $48 billion - lowest since the 2008 crisis.

* The markets have a reputation for being sensitive. They tend to react even if Raghuram Rajan so much as sneezes. So events like the US Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate hike, or Britain’s referendum to leave the European Union, or China’s worsening economy are all but guaranteed to sway the markets one way or another. But forget all of that. After a 2-year drought, we have a monsoon on our doorsteps that has been forecast as above average - and experts [say](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/forget-fed-brace-up-for-monsoon-bonanza-on-d-street-el-nino-is-gone/articleshow/52430422.cms), this is the event that will define the economy over the next few months.

**2020: Double the Coal, Double the Asthma**

Tesla Motors of the United States just launched the Model 3 electric car that can run entirely on solar power, reducing any climate effects since it doesn’t need gasoline. Piyush Goyal of the Indian Power and Coal Ministry, on the other hand, just assured everyone that India will indeed [double] (http://profit.ndtv.com/news/commodities/article-india-to-rely-on-state-miners-to-meet-coal-target-piyush-goyal-1291421) its coal production by 2020, increasing every imaginable climate effect. So the government wants to increase coal production to 1.5 billion tonnes by 2020. State-owned Coal India ([COALINDIA](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ACOALINDIA&ei=vtABV7DnAtbajAGNr57QBQ)), India’s largest coal mining company, is already on track to increase its own production to 1 billion tonnes by 2020. The private sector was expected to pick up the tab for the remaining half a billion tonnes. But since the private sector companies are strapped for cash and can’t increase coal production to meet the target, the coal minister is pushing for other state-owned companies like NTPC ([NTPC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANTPC&ei=XtEBV7n2CoSA2AaLz7vwCA)), National Aluminium Co ([NATIONALUM](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANATIONALUM&ei=ndEBV6GTBISe2AbWvIy4AQ)) to step up their coal production so the government can meet that target. “Renewables? Climate change? Pollution? Asthma? What do those words even mean?” - Piyush Goyal (paraphrased).

**No Smoking**

A group of cigarette manufacturing companies led by ITC Ltd. ([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC&ei=rNEBV-GJHMP02AbI5KiABQ)) through the Tobacco Institute of India have shut down all cigarette manufacturing facilities since [April 1st](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-itc-not-ready-to-print-bigger-health-warnings-on-cigarette-packs-factories-to-remain-shut-2197282). The stated reason for this is because of the ‘ambiguity’ over the size of pictorial health warnings on cigarette packages. Every cigarette packet is mandated by law to have horrible pictures of Satan’s lungs over them to discourage smoking. While a parliamentary committee had recommended the size of those pictures to be 50% of the packaging, the health ministry had ordered for the figure to be 85%. Not knowing which figure to follow, the cigarette manufacturers have decided to just shut down all operations and take daily losses of ₹350 crore. The theory behind the size of the pictures being - larger the picture, lesser the smoking. If you listen hard, you can almost hear the patron saint of anti-smoking ads, Mukesh turning in his grave thinking of what would’ve been if only the 85% sized pictures had come in his lifetime.

**Buybacks and Dividends to the Rescue!**

The Indian football team can’t set goals to win the FIFA World Cup 2018, unfortunately that’s just not realistic. And one of the basic rules of setting goals is that they should be realistically achievable. But somebody in the government never got that memo. After five consecutive years of failing to achieve targets of money raised through disinvestment, the government still set an all-time record [high](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/PAYP49n1pV885tWIPO7d3J/Disinvestment-scorecard-Govt-a-to-miss-target-16th-tim.html) target for this year. So it shouldn’t exactly be a surprise when it misses targets this year as well, which will be the 16th time in 25 years now. But unrealistic targets also lead to desperate actions to fulfill those targets. In this case, the government is looking at buybacks and special [dividends](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Govt-banks-on-unlisted-PSUs-to-mop-up-Rs-5k-cr-this-week/articleshow/51577307.cms) from unlisted state-owned companies like Hindustan Aeronautics and others. The extra cash in those companies will now be used to buy shares back from the government and declare special dividends amounting to almost ₹5,000 crore to help the government meet targets this year. Who wants to bet we’ll still miss targets this year and set an even higher target for next year?

**BJP’s Beef Ban Backfires**

(pause for reader to appreciate that alliteration) As a part of the BJP’s beef ban that was introduced in BJP-ruled states last year, it is prohibited to sell your cattle for slaughter. For people living in cities drinking Starbucks coffee, that’s hardly a problem since they don’t really own a lot of cattle. But for farmers living in villages drinking unfiltered water, that’s a huge [problem](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-beef-idINKCN0WU1UQ). If the rains don’t show up for a particular year, the crops fail and the farmer sells his cattle to feed his family. And when the rains do show up the next year, the crops blossom and the farmer buys the cattle back. But the beef ban just threw a wrench in this cycle by making it harder for people to sell their cows. Cattle prices have fallen across the country, by almost 40 to 60 percent in one district of Maharashtra and India’s meat exports have dropped 13%. This comes at a time when the government is trying very hard to appease farmers in a bid to win state elections later this year.

**For Sale: Tata Steel UK, Condition: Slightly Used**

On second thoughts, slightly used might not be the correct way of describing Tata Steel’s UK business. ‘Abused by the Chinese’ might be more accurate. Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL&ei=3NEBV-H3IceJ2AbIrarYCw)) entered the UK Steel market by acquiring Corus, a company that was three times bigger than itself for $8.1 billion (₹53,654 crore) in 2007. Fast forward to two months ago, it declared a [loss](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/tata-steel-reports-third-quarter-loss-chinese-imports) of £68 million (₹641 crore) after suffering from cheap Chinese imports, high energy costs and weak demand. Last week, Tata Steel announced that it was putting up its entire UK business on the [auction](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot) block. The problem is: no one’s bidding. The UK government is even debating on just nationalizing the whole business to prevent mass layoffs and to protect what is an important part of the British economy. Of course, that’ll only be temporary nationalization until suitable buyers from the private sector can be found. Otherwise, it’ll be socialism (gasp).

**100% FDI in E-commerce *T&C Apply**

Millions of family-owned corner stores across India have moaned and complained since forever against e-commerce companies taking their customers away. And with Amazon gaining a foothold and Alibaba planning an Indian expansion, the e-commerce field in India is increasingly being dominated by foreign companies. The corner store guys were having none of this and filed a lawsuit saying this was illegal since foreign companies aren’t exactly allowed to set up retail operations in India. After years of uncertainty, we finally have a ruling on this - foreign companies are now legally allowed to set up e-commerce operations in India, but terms and conditions [apply](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec51a45e-f5be-11e5-9afe-dd2472ea263d.html#axzz44oZbeUBy) (don’t they always?). These companies can’t sell directly to customers, but can only connect buyers and sellers. No single seller can account for more than 25% of sales. And these companies can not set prices themselves to offer discounts, as many do now to attract customers. Buy that smartphone for cheap while you can, the days of deep discounts may end before you know it.

How facetious. After a great start to the series, this is really disappointing. Its an Electric car, not a solar car. You can theoretically you call it as running on solar power by using electricity generated exclusively from solar plants. 

India needs a lot of power and coal will be the short term solution.

 Thank you. 

I dont agree to the comments on the piyush goel but thats ok. I think so far this government has done more work on renewable energy compared to any other government so far. >If you listen hard, you can almost hear the patron saint of anti-smoking ads, Mukesh turning in his grave thinking of what would’ve been if only the 85% sized pictures had come in his lifetime.

 gods work. keep it up & thanks.  Am I the only one who thinks this is bullshit? Call it an opinion on the news, not a summary of the Indian Economy for fucks sake.  When you are in a poor country, you need cheap power. Hence why coal is important. We arent nearly rich enough to worry fixing first world problems like climate effects etc. We are trying other things, thats ok, but taking it out on coal is silly. The whole country faces power outages because of the lack of coal supply. Also, either way, what we dont produce will be bought. Its not like our coal power plants will magically turn into solar farms in an instant. If this was a little less politically charged, it'd be great! Great summary of the week, wonderful to read.

How do I start investing in the stock market here? Can someone with experience help me out?,67,4dfdi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4dfdi7/how_do_i_start_investing_in_the_stock_market_here/,47," x post from r/indiainvestments :

So I'm 22. Just out of college having studied finance and business, I feel I am ready to start with a small amount, I have a little over a Lakh saved for stocks. My questions are, what is the best method to invest in them personally? ie I want to manage it myself, not a broker or anything. Secondly, I am aware of the Valuation methods such as DDM and Cash FLow Valuation. I can even do a thorough financial Analysis of the company's accounts having a finance background. My dad said a lot of that wont be useful in India as there is a lot of dirty business going on and not a lot of it is done on merit. Guys that have been doing it for a while, it would be great if you could share your stories and help a young guy out.",BatsmenTerminator," Hey dude, I started investing in Jan. I am sharing what I learned in the last few months.

* Read ""One Up on Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch. It will give you a new perspective to look at companies.
* You should start with Nifty 50 companies. Those companies will not die and will force you into a habit to checking financial news and the stocks prices in general.
* Create a portfolio on google finance or moneycontrol of companies you think you will be interested in.
* Read news related to your portfolio companies.
* Use screener.in for stock screening.
* Its better to buy when the stock market is down. Jan-Feb was the perfect time to join for me since every stock was down. So I invested in some blue chip companies all of which are giving me > 10% return. 
* Since the market is still fluctuating look for days when it has gone down to pick up stocks.
* Start slow with 15-20k and look at how things work out.
* Don't pick expensive shares which cost more than 1000 or ones with PE ratio more then 20. Since if you will be able to buy on 10-15 shares so even if the prices go up by 100 the net income will be only 1000 (you will pay brokerage also on this).  Also price change of 100 does not happen so quickly.

The best way to learn is to start investing. Do not be afraid of failures. Take calculated risks on how much you can afford to lose.  DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT invest in individual stocks after analyzing their cash flow you read through their annual reports. 

1- That information is already priced-in. People have priced the stock based on that information. 

2- There are people with better information then you, those who know CFO ( insider trades) , have been given a tour of the factory( analysts) or understand the sector far better than you. Also there are billion dollar companies who have far more advanced models than what your quad core laptop can possibly run. 

In short, you will not be a player with any advantage by analyzing cash flows. 

3- If you want to invest to make money, invest in mutual funds because frankly they exploit insider information to identify better stocks than you will. They know the govt. policy before it is made public. etc. etc. 

If you want to invest to learn, try building a portfolio on one of those finance sites like Yahoo finance etc. etc. In fact it may be better to pick up a mature market like US for that since there will be lot more data available for you to analyze. You don't need real cash for that ! 

My credentials are that I was in investment management business for 1 year. I have sold hedge funds and REIT's. Trust me, trading directly in stocks is dangerous, although in my stupid bravado, I still sometimes do it :( 

 Log on to www.zerodha.com and create an account. They'll ask you for some ID proof etc. and then set you up with a Demat and Trading account. You can then buy Shares, Mutual Funds, Commodities, Futures and Options, and even Currency Futures. They're one of the cheapest brokerages in India. 

I currently trade with them and so far haven't had any complaints.  Is it worth the time it requires keeping tabs on companies and all? Few basics to covers

Decide what you want to become, a broker i.e one who looks at stock prices every single day and worries about the market fluctuation or an investor who wants to own part of a business because of a hope that you may make some money in future and you believe that company would be able to better use your money for the time you have invested in it than you would. 


If you are looking to become a stock broker than i don't have any advice for you  and you can stop reading here i am sure someone else would be better to help but if you want to become an investor then i have somethings that might be of interest. 

Finish up this reading list in that order.

good luck 

p.s. please ignore the typographical error, if any Invest in Funds instead of trading yourself. They are experts getting paid a whole lot of money to make you and the company $$$ and usually know their stuff more than you do.


Never try to time the market. You need a special kind of luck and very very special talent to do that.  From where you sit, I would recommend you investing your time in building up your career. Just buy tax free government bonds. 8% risk free is best for you. > My dad said a lot of that wont be useful in India as there is a lot of dirty business going on and not a lot of it is done on merit.

Your Dad is partly right, lot of smaller companies do play dirty but if you stick to large and mid cap companies and looking at their 10 year financials helps you figure out which is good and which is bad company to invest.

**Killing Tax Havens - One Treaty At A Time**

Question - What country ranks second in the share of foreign portfolio investments made in the Indian stock market? Answer - First of all, that is a very specific question to ask. And second of all, if you [answered](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-12/news/73039798_1_tax-treaty-capital-gains-tax-mauritius) Mauritius, give yourself a pat on the back. It’s not that ~~Martian~~ Mauritian citizens are crazy about Indian stocks, Mauritius is just an island that is even smaller than Mumbai and Delhi put together. It’s that investments made through Mauritius were exempt from Indian capital gains taxes - which essentially transformed Mauritius into a tax haven. It was all legal under a 30-year old treaty between the two countries that was signed in 1983. Ahh, the 1980s - when the Panama Papers wasn’t a thing, the accountants didn’t have to worry about ethics, and writing physical letters was actually cool and not just hipster cool. But all that and more is changing. Under an amendment to the treaty that was [agreed](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/u4AzTTKA5vCRJBWhANkuZN/Some-FAQs-on-the-Mauritius-tax-treaty.html) upon last week, India will begin imposing a capital gains tax on all future investments made through the country. This gives existing investors some wiggle room, and doesn’t trigger a crash in case existing investors decide to pull out.


**Raghu’s Second Term**

Time flies when you’re having fun, and it’s already time for another governor at the RBI. Current governor Raghuram Rajan’s term is about to end in September and there’s some awkward tension in the air about his reappointment since Rajan’s crusade against bad loans is expected to be done by March 2017, a full 6 months after his term expires. Chosen under former PM Manmohan Singh’s administration, Rajan [says](http://www.businessinsider.in/RBIs-Raghuram-Rajan-keeps-mum-about-second-term-but-reveals-his-backup-plan/articleshow/52185985.cms) he hasn’t been asked if he wants to continue as governor and intends to go back to teaching when he’s done. He can act as coy as he wants, but everyone knows that he wants to continue as governor. Who wouldn’t? It’s like asking an olympic gold winner if he’d like to continue winning the gold. However, the newest member of the Rajya Sabha, Subramanian Swamy, has [stated](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/send-raghuram-rajan-back-to-chicago-subramanian-swamys-new-attack-1405498) that Rajan is unsuitable to run the RBI and shouldn’t be reappointed. Swamy says that Rajan should instead pack up his bags and go to the US, where he is a professor at the University of Chicago. ‘Go back to (insert country here)’ seems to be a recurring theme lately.

**EPF Changes: Strike Three?**

At first they tried to tax your EPF withdrawals. But that didn’t work out. Then, they tried to restrict EPF withdrawals until you’re 58. But that didn’t work out either. Now, they are back. And this time, they want to help you buy a house. A new scheme currently under discussion would [allow](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/epfo-members-to-benefit-as-govt-plans-low-cost-housing-scheme-for-over-5-cr-subscribers/251510/) you to pledge future EPF contributions as installments towards buying a house. Here’s how it would work: You go out and try to find your ultimate dream house. You give up and settle on one that your wife likes, because you just want to get this over with. Then you find a bank that doesn’t think you’re Mallya 2.0 and gives you a home loan. And now, your future EPF contributions can count as installments on the home loan. But you also have to be a low-income first-time home buyer to qualify. The last two times any modifications to the EPF system have been proposed, they have backfired. If this were baseball, the batter is already two strikes down and might end up with a strikeout, if this backfires as well.

**Numbers You Don’t Want To Hear**

The kryptonite of any agrarian economy is a prolonged drought. Like the one we’ve been having in over 10 states for the past two years now. A recent study [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/rs-650000-crore-thats-the-impact-the-drought-will-have-on-the-indian-economy-says-assocham/) the total impact of that drought on the national economy at ₹6,50,000 crore. That number is so huge, your brain is incapable of processing it. That’s because a loss of ₹100 is a tragedy, a loss of ₹100 crore is a statistic. Moving on to some much lighter news - the Indian banking [system](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/its-that-bad-if-you-pay-rs-150-for-a-bank-stock-rs-50-is-going-as-bad-loan/articleshow/52291846.cms) is on fire. If you spend ₹150 on buying stock in the average Indian bank right now - you’d be spending ₹50 just to purchase the bad loans that come with the bank. The skeletons could’ve stopped tumbling out at any point - but what’s the fun in that? New estimates show that the amount of bad loans in the Indian banking system might be greater than the entire economy of New Zealand. Little reminder - In statistics, you can either pick the data and write the story it supports, or you can pick the story and write the data that supports it.

 Brilliant stuff, as always.

Two things:

1) Why, according to you, is the government so eager to dip into the EPF money? From what you have written about the low-income housing scheme, do you think it's a constant effort to redirect the money towards recapitalizing failing banks?

2) PNB Q4 results will be out today. Do you have an inkling when the other banks will start declaring theirs? Sensex is already jittery, fell 250 points since morning.

**No Money? No Problem**

No Problem for the banks that loaned you the money - big problems for you. The Lok Sabha just [passed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-bankruptcy-idUSKCN0XS1NW) the landmark Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Currently, we use a patchwork of laws that govern bankruptcies in India. That patchwork has resulted in 70,000 pending cases of bankruptcies. But the new bill sets a deadline of 180 days after the business defaults on loans during which the business owners and the lenders have to reach a resolution. Failing a resolution, the lenders can then sell the business to recover dues. This country is slowing moving to a market-based economy ever since the fall of the Soviet Union. And capitalism without bankruptcy is like christianity without hell. An interesting recommendation that could end up in the law seeks to ban bankrupt people from contesting in elections. Wonder if there was any specific person that inspired this recommendation. You know, a specific person who was a businessman and a politician but also went bankrupt while receiving excessive media coverage coinciding with a time when a lot of the banks are dealing with bad loans? (*cough cough* Vijay Mallya).

**A Democratic RBI**

Currently, the RBI functions like a dictatorship with the governor being the supreme leader. Basically, while sitting in his pajamas, Raghuram Rajan can make major changes that could either launch the economy into the future or turn the economy upside down. And nobody can do anything about it. But now the Finance Bill which just [passed](http://qz.com/676943/indias-bullet-proof-central-bank-is-about-to-get-another-layer-of-armour/) the Lok Sabha and is expected to pass the Rajya Sabha as well will turn the RBI into a quasi-democracy. The bill seeks to replace the current system with a six-member panel with three representatives from the government and three from the RBI. The panel will vote on the changes to be made and Rajan will be given the tie-breaker vote. No wonder Rajan is all for the new system because one, most major central banks do it this way, two, centralized power just hasn’t work out well historically and three, in case of terrible outcomes - just point to the panel for all the blame and in case of great outcomes - bask in the glory of all the history books and mainstream media credit as the governor of the RBI.

**Flopkart**

(That title was so obvious, it had to be used.) What’s the most important law of nature? No, it’s not ‘people who wear crocs don’t get laid’. It’s the law of gravity. What goes up must come down. Just a few years ago, Flipkart was the hot new thing on the startup scene. But now competition in the space is heating up. Starting just a few months ago, minority investors in Flipkart have begun to [slash](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/more-investors-mark-down-flipkart-valuation-116050400523_1.html) the value of their shares in Flipkart. In February, Morgan Stanley marked its investments in Flipkart down by 27%. Last month, T-Rowe Price marked its investments down by 15%. And now, Fidelity and Valic slashed the value of their investments by more than 20%. It’s not just Flipkart. HSBC [published](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/zomato-demicorn/) a report that basically says Zomato is worth only half of what people say it’s worth. Is this what it felt like in 2000 just before the startup bubble popped? Zomato, which is thought to be a unicorn (a startup worth a billion dollars) might just be a demicorn (a startup worth half a billion - trademark pending). 

**The Singh Bros of Ranbaxy**

They say you should never hide information from your doctors and lawyers. Add one more to that list - a Japanese corporation that’s buying a majority stake in your business. The Singh brothers, ex-promoters of pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy Laboratories, are finding out just what happens when you cross that line. In 2008, the Singh bros sold a majority stake in Ranbaxy to the Japanese corporation, Daiichi-Sankyo (with an appropriately Japanese name too). But they allegedly, hid information from Daiichi that Ranbaxy was adulterating drugs that were made in India and sold in the US. They were caught in 2013, and Daiichi-owned Ranbaxy had to pay $500 million in damages. Since Daiichi had no idea that Ranbaxy was involved in these shady dealings when it bought a majority stake in 2008, it sued the Singh brothers for hiding that information. An arbitration panel last week found the Singh brothers guilty and [asked](http://www.wsj.com/articles/former-ranbaxy-owners-ordered-to-pay-385-million-to-daiichi-sankyo-1462473046) them to pay $385 million to Daiichi as damages. That’s got to be a bitter pill to swallow.

Data from the agricultural census [says](http://scroll.in/article/807603/failure-of-reforms-5-of-indias-farmers-own-a-third-of-the-land) just 5% of the farmers own over 30% of India’s farmland.

And then, of course, resumed production within 48 hours. Frankly, people are going to be disappointed if they don’t do the same thing next week.

* Tata Steel’s UK business has been underwater for a long time now. And the lungs are about to give up and flood water. Unless someone throws in a lifebuoy.

There are lots of people, well educated people, who have no understanding of a lot of things outside their area of expertise.
 
Now there is pressure from society on these people, to give their opinions on X, Y and Z. Rather than saying I am not an expert and go and ask an expert, many of these people will quote such summaries to maintain some unnecessary illusion or the other.

This just wastes everyone's time. Actual experts are ignored or paid less attention too and misinformation increases. 

Yes we can give kids access to a library of Maths books, but then if we fill the library with the kids summaries, commentaries and opinions about everything then what happens?  ",Business/Finance,2016-05-10 12:10:54

**WANTED: RBI Governor**

Alright, you knew this was coming. You don’t live under a rock. You’ve heard about this. We have had wall to wall coverage of this story since it broke. And as the most important economic story of the week, it has to be talked about here. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan does not [want](http://in.reuters.com/article/rbi-chief-rajan-quit-idINKCN0Z50N2) a second term. In a message to the RBI staff that was released on the central bank’s website, Rajan has stated his desire to not continue as the governor. Instead, he’s going back to his old teaching job in the US. Apparently, the governor was very much interested in serving a second term. But getting reappointed would mean that he would have to maneuver the delicate political minefield. And Rajan was unwilling to get down and dirty in the intricate interlockings of Indian politics, which has now become more complex than the plot of Game of Thrones. And so, the House of Rajan will now be leaving the show in September. This decision to not continue marks a political victory for the campaign against his reappointment, which was led by Subramanium from the House of Swamy. 


**Flying Higher**

Rule 4/20 is the rule that states you must smoke a little something when the clock strikes 4:20. Rule 5/20 is not as exciting or fun, and only applies to the Indian aviation industry. The 5/20 rule states that any Indian airliner must have 5 years of experience flying domestic routes and must own 20 aircrafts before it can operate any international routes. It might sound like redundant regulation to you, but that’s not how the folks at Jet Airways and SpiceJet see this. To incumbent airliners who already satisfy the rule, this is hugely beneficial since it removes competition on international routes. But to newer airliners like Air Asia who don’t satisfy the rule, this is a lost business opportunity. But a new civil aviation policy approved last week [removed](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-airlines-rules-idINKCN0Z110J) the 5-year experience requirement, however the 20 aircraft rule still stands, making it the 0/20 rule. A big round of FDI reforms has also eased rules for FDI in the aviation industry.

**EU & Britain - The Big Divorce**

Britain, the real reason why Indians love tea and cricket, is going through a messy divorce. In a nation-wide referendum, Britishers will soon vote if they want the country to leave the European Union or stay in the European Union. A popular argument for staying in the EU cites the disastrous effects that the British economy is expected to experience if it leaves. The UK Treasury [says](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/macro-view/talking-point-brexit-and-indian-markets/article8748796.ece) that if Britain leaves, inflation will spike, unemployment will rise, and GDP growth might be 6% lower. But let’s be honest, most of you can’t be bothered to keep up with even the Indian economy. The news is boring, uninteresting, mundane and all the other synonyms of boring. And here is a story asking you to care about the British economy. So before you tune out, know that you should care about this because the global economy is a series of dominos, and one of them might fall next week. Most of the world is urging Britain to stay in the EU. But really, the only evidence that anyone needs to take into consideration is - Donald Trump supports Britain leaving the EU. And that right there, should be enough information for the British people to know which way to vote.

**STILL WANTED: RBI Governor**

You know what? We haven’t talked about this enough. This story deserves another look. The big news of Rajan’s departure was dropped in an open letter that Rajan wrote to the RBI staff. And it caught everyone off-guard, including the government. While Rajan gets ready for his exit interview, the government is busy looking at résumés of candidates to fill his position. The news of his departure isn’t even a week old, but the race to replace him is already starting to heat up. The shortlist has as many as [seven](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/seven-names-on-long-list-to-replace-rbis-rajan-official-1420762) people, but the frontrunner right now is Arundhati Bhattacharya, a high-profile banker who has been at the helm of India's largest lender - State Bank of India. If you think you can make the shortlist, send your CV to: Sansad Marg, Janpath, New Delhi, Delhi 110001. Either way, get ready to bid farewell to Rajan. It sure was good while it lasted, wasn’t it? But like all good things in life, it had to come to an end. Rajan, we had a lot of fun together, didn’t we? Remember when you cut consumer inflation from a high of 11.16% to a low of 3.69%? Yeah.. Good times. And remember when you increased the foreign exchange reserves from $275 billion to $363 billion? Yeah... Those were the days. I’m sorry, I think I need some time alone.

* To stop cheap imports of foreign wheat from messing with the domestic wheat market which employs a lot of farmers, the government levies a duty of 25% on all wheat imports. Last week, the duty which was set to expire this month was [renewed](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/180616/india-extends-25-percent-tax-on-wheat-imports-ram-vilas-paswan.html) for 3 more months. But it might not work as planned. Despite being the world’s 2nd largest producer of wheat, Indian imports of wheat could touch a decade-high this year. Well, at least the government will make a ton of cash off it.

* Technically, Amazon India is not an e-commerce company. It is an online marketplace [that](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/amazon-continues-to-lobby-for-hybrid-ecommerce-model-in-india-116061300365_1.html) connects buyers and sellers. E-commerce is when you sell inventory directly to the buyer. Current regulations don’t allow FDI in e-commerce, which means foreign companies like Amazon can’t enter the e-commerce industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently met PM Modi and lobbied him to allow FDI in e-commerce. One can only imagine how frustrated Bezos must’ve felt when they told him that last week, India [eased](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/govt-to-hold-briefing-on-fdi-rules-today/article8751887.ece) FDI rules for 9 industries including aviation, defense, pharma and food processing. Can you guess which industry didn’t make the cut?

* Larsen & Toubro has [bagged](http://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-qatar-idINKCN0YS0P2) a $135 million contract to build a stadium in Qatar for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. $135 million is a lot of money. Qatar’s economy is largely based on oil and prices are not exactly ideal right now. So if you’re wondering how they are even paying for the stadium, wonder no more - The Gulf country has cut planned spending on building hospitals by about two-thirds in 2016 following the drop in oil prices to keep expenditure on its World Cup-related projects unchanged. Those are some solid priorities right there.

* It hasn’t even been a week since the news of Rajan’s departure broke and bad news has already [started](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/wpi-inflation-rises-to-079-in-may-on-higher-food-prices/article8727957.ece) rolling in. Consumer inflation, which halved during Rajan’s tenure, came in at a 21-month high of 5.76% for the month of May. Food prices for the month went up by 7.55%, also a 21-month high. Wholesale inflation, which was negative until two months ago, came in at a 19-month high of 0.76%. RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

They say there aren’t any free lunches in the world. But at least you don’t get the bill after a free lunch. However, that might soon change. Due to some ambiguity in the GST bill as it stands right now, you could [potentially](http://www.businessinsider.in/Nothing-is-going-to-come-for-free-after-GST-is-implemented-Heres-why/articleshow/52775662.cms) end up paying taxes on things that you get for free. While it is highly unlikely that this goes through, this could spell the end of all those ‘Buy One, Get One Free’ offers that businesses use to kill two birds with one stone - get some solid goodwill with consumers, and get rid of old merchandise.

For a lot of Indians, the festival that brings families and friends together is no longer Diwali. It’s the festival of IPL. The sporting franchise recently concluded its 9th season this year.

A big chunk of that money, as much as ₹1,100 crore went to Sony as the official broadcaster of the IPL. With that kind of cash, it doesn’t matter which team you support or which team wins, the executives at Sony always win.

Wanted to add three links, if you are interested in knowing more about this issue:

1) The pro-Brexit people made [a nice hour long documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMxfAkxfQ0) to explain why UK should not be a part of EU. It's quite convincing, to be honest. Do watch, if you have the time and inclination.

2) John Oliver did a [sort-of anti-Brexit segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAgKHSNqxa8) on Last Week Tonight. He made some valid points too. Don't miss the little boy with a british accent singing ""Fuck you EU"" towards the end.

3) Here's [a calm and quiet discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlzpC2qFnws) on what impact Brexit will have on the global economy and India. God bless Rajya Sabha TV. Doing the real work, talking about the right things.

Thank you for this /u/DexterMilburn. The post is epic, as always! :) Yet another masterpiece delivered OP, thanks. I was hoping to find your comments on FDI easing for this week's thread. Nevertheless i shall wait for, when the master believes is a, right time.  Correct me if I am wrong but what about conflict of interest? Making Arundhati Bhattacharya RBI Governor means SBI has a lot of pull in RBI. Don't tell me that there wouldn't be nepotism. If KV Kamath was the front runner for selection only then will people think about it? > RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

LOL, you're in love with Rajan! Remembered how George Soros made a killing by hedging when britain left EU that time, is the situation kind of same? Did the PNB not have a bad year with epic losses in NPA's, how are their stocks so valued? Great post. Loved reading it. Keep 'em coming. Is there any particular reason behind Punjab National Bank surging? Or is it just recovering from a low earlier? Content plus humour... bright spot in r/India Thank you.

**Earnings-Palooza Continues**

The festivities for the quarter ending March continued with Airtel [reporting](http://www.firstpost.com/business/bharti-airtels-q4-profits-up-15-per-cent-rise-in-subscribers-for-mobile-internet-2753518.html) a 3% increase in net profits and a subscriber total of 35 million Indians. Airtel’s gain turned out to be Idea’s pain. Shares of Idea traded down after the company [reported](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/markets/indian-markets/idea-cellular-stocks-today-on-bse-sensex-nse-nifty-on-april-29-2016/245221/) almost 40% decrease in profits. That had to have hurt. The main event of the week were the banks that were reporting earnings. Profits at Axis Bank [fell](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/LlwW49im93N1GmvPrUm64H/Q4-results-Axis-Bank-profit-falls-for-the-first-time-in-46.html) almost 2% as bad loans went up - it’s the bank’s first decline in quarterly profits in over a decade. ICICI Bank, the country’s largest private sector bank, [reported](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/icici-bank-q4-profit-hit-by-provisioning-116042900307_1.html) a 76% decline in profits, the sharpest decline of quarterly profits ever in its entire history. Records like that are probably best left unbroken. Just as you breath a sign that after results like those, the worst is probably over - you realize it really isn’t. Both banks said that they expected the amount of bad loans to increase for a few quarters. Shareholders of bank stocks better get used to the pain of being burned by bad loans. Masochist shareholders of bank stocks can relax.


**Maruti Suzuki**: **:’(**

Delhi’s odd-even rule has drawn a lot of flak from residents who are being forced to take the bus every other day and smell the smells of the people on the bus. Among those unhappy has to be Maruti Suzuki, India’s biggest car maker. Maruti’s results for the first quarter of 2016 [reported](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/live-maruti-suzuki-q4-results-fy16-net-profit-sales-revenue-margins/243113/) a 12% decline in profits. Interestingly, the company cites the Jat reservation agitation as one of the reasons for a fall in profits. But there are also people who are happy with the odd-even rule. Like a 13-year old boy who registered the domain odd-even.com and [sold](http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Remember-The-13YearOld-Who-Created-The-OddEven-Website-Has-Now-Sold-It-To-Orahi/) it to carpooling app, Orahi and now attends advisory board meetings at Orahi as a technical expert, presumably right after watching Chota Bheem. Sticking to the theme, chalk this one up as win for the militant environmentalists - Mahindra is planning to [build](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-mahindra-to-build-indias-first-automobile-shredding-plant-2016-4) India’s first automobile shredding plant that will focus on destroying 100,000 units of old cars, ships and machines per year. They should upload videos of machines crushing cars to YouTube.

**Let’s Pretend Like This Is A Creative Title**

Every time there’s technological progress, people piss themselves silly telling everyone that machines will take all our jobs now. That has been happening since the past decade or so and likely started when they invented swords to replace the jobs of all the people who made pointy sticks. But today, there is a special kind of irony when the engineers who make machines and software that replace other people’s jobs start getting replaced by software and machines themselves. One of Infosys’ co-founders says growth in hiring has [decreased](http://www.businessinsider.in/Heres-why-automation-AI-is-good-news-for-IT-companies-and-bad-news-for-you/articleshow/52037635.cms) by 40% over the past 10 years and will likely fall further. And it’s all happening because of automation in the IT industry. There’s only one job available for every five engineers graduating every year. Psh, and they said arts students don’t get jobs. Due to this increased supply and reduced demand, salaries for new hires [stayed](http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate/no-salary-hike-for-freshers-in-it-space-amid-hiring-blues/52019188) pretty much the same despite a booming IT industry. Indians who opted for the road less traveled despite family pressure to pursue engineering cannot stop smiling right now.

**Last Week In Vijay Mallya’s Life**

Not to jump on the bandwagon of hating him because it’s cool now, but that Mallya fellow just can’t stay out of the news media, try as he might. Either that or the news media just can’t stay out of Mallya’s life, and they don’t even try. Brands confiscated by the banks a few weeks ago like ‘Fly the Good Times’ and ‘Fly Kingfisher’ were [put](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/logistics/lenders-begin-auction-of-brand-kingfisher-trademarks/article8540946.ece) on auction for the second time. And for the second time, nobody was stupid enough to make a bid. The minimum price was set at ₹367 crore. It’s safe to say - those brands are poisonous by now. The Supreme Court [directed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sc-directs-vijay-mallya-to-furnish-details-of-assets-in-india-abroad/) Mallya to declare all his foreign and domestic assets to the banks so they can be better prepared at the negotiations table. Mallya isn’t back in the news. He just never left the news. They also just [revoked](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/india-revokes-passport-of-vijay-mallya-who-fled-to-london-owing-13bn) his passport - and being an MP, he’s even got one of those shiny red diplomatic passports, which is now useless. That last sentence was written before news broke that Mallya had [resigned](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vijay-mallya-resigns-from-rajya-sabha/article8547747.ece) from the Rajya Sabha -  so now that shiny red diplomatic passport is really useless.

**Bros Again: Reliance and Iran**

The Iranian Revolution of 1979 overthrew the ruling dynasty in Iran which was supported by the US. Since this was a matter of internal politics in a sovereign country outside the US territory, the US had to respond, as is tradition - and it promptly imposed economic sanctions, which were recently lifted. Reliance, which has substantial investments in the US, had suspended trade with Iran for fears of being dragged through the mud in the US. But last week, Reliance [resumed](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/reliance-buys-iranian-oil-after-6-year-hiatus_6377461.html) buying oil from Iran after almost 6 years. Talking about oil - oil prices have crashed the floor and everyone’s predicting the end of Saudi Arabia as we know it. There was even talk about an IPO for Saudi Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, to raise cash and douse the fire lit by falling oil prices. If there is a fire, the kingdom is trying to hide the smoke. Saudi Aramco is now actually looking to [expand](http://www.indiainfoline.com/article/news-top-story/saudi-aramco-mulling-offers-for-indian-oil-refinery-stakes-pradhan-116042600203_1.html) and buy stakes in Indian petrochemical projects, possibly in a planned oil refinery on the west coast.

* The presidential elections in the United States are proving to be the best drama series since Breaking Bad. And presidential candidates are all about that minimum wage. Even though the same conversation about minimum wage in India is painted less so with a political brush, last week we managed to [increase](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-contract-workers-may-soon-get-rs-10000-as-monthly-minimum-wage-2203056) the minimum wage for workers hired by contractors to ₹10,000 per month.

* Disclosing your salary to your coworkers can certainly make for some awkward water cooler conversation. But what if you are mandated by law to disclose your salary, not just to your coworkers but to the entire country? An RTI disclosure recently [revealed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/banking-finance/article-raghuram-rajan-not-top-paid-executive-at-rbi-report-1398885) that RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, the guy that basically runs the Indian economy, is paid a gross salary of ₹1.98 lakh per month. Here’s the shocker - he’s not even the highest paid employee at RBI.

* Warren Buffett, everyone’s favourite billionaire (sorry Bill) recently livestreamed his company’s annual shareholder meeting on Yahoo. During the meeting, he showered praises upon praises on Amazon founder and fellow billionaire, Jeff Bezos. And Jeff deserves that pat on the back - As Amazon reported profits and revenues that crushed expectations back home in the United States, Amazon India [surpassed](http://www.bidnessetc.com/68048-amazon-shoves-snapdeal-aside-become-indias-2nd-largest-online-retailer/) Snapdeal to become the 2nd largest online marketplace in India after Flipkart.

* Two weeks ago, it was about Japan building India’s first bullet train. But then there’s China who wants to [build](http://techstory.in/india-high-speed-rail-network-19042016/) a second bullet train route in India, possibly a Delhi-Chennai connection. China does have the world’s largest bullet train network that it claims is profitable, but it also [has](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/india-on-5th-place-in-fake-goods-trade-china-on-top/story/232014.html) 63% market share in the global fake goods trade (India has 2%). Considering the state of Indian Railways, fake Chinese bullet trains will probably still be an upgrade.

Amazon is doing great. But Apple has seen better days. It reported a 22% fall in profits for the previous quarter. Its stock is down 15% for the month. It’s so bad that Apple CEO Tim Cook had to go on American TV to remind everyone that it’s still the most profitable company in the world. In India, things are equally grim. Market share of iPhones [dropped](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Samsung-outpaces-Apple-to-emerge-as-leader-in-Indias-premium-smartphone-segment/articleshow/52035720.cms) from 55% a year ago to just 37% today. And Samsung emerged as the leader with a 62% market share. Where are all the apple fanboys now, huh?

In a lot of the developed world, people always call out the top 1%, the richest individuals, to stop evading taxes and pay their fair share. But in India, if you do pay taxes, you are actually the 1%. Government data shows only 1.25 crore Indians [paid](http://www.indiainfoline.com/article/news-top-story/only-1-of-india-s-population-pays-taxes-govt-data-116050200008_1.html) taxes in 2012-13 which is about 1% of the population.

###Headline Stories

**Return Of The Avengers**

Whoever says Hollywood’s superhero movies are unrealistic? The Avengers are actually real. Hollywood’s Avengers was a group of superheroes saving the universe by blowing stuff up. In reality, the Avengers are a group of guys that just blow stuff up for no real reason. The Niger Delta Avengers militant group has been [blowing](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/oil-hovers-near-8-month-highs-on-us-inventory-draw.html) up oil wells in Nigeria and has rejected any peace talks with the government. After dropping to dangerous lows of $20, crude oil prices have bounced back and recently crossed the $50 mark. Much of the reason for this rise is simply the forces of supply and demand reacting to each other in a free market. But one of the reasons it touched $50 last week was the Avengers sabotaging oil wells. A lot of investors betting on the resurgence of oil can’t say this out loud, but thank god for terrorist Avengers. However, not everybody is celebrating the return of oil. In the latest policy review, the RBI (which kept interest rates untouched last week), [cited](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/black-gold-a-headache-not-only-for-modi-but-for-raghuram-rajan-too/articleshow/52634156.cms) rising oil prices as a risk. Because when oil prices go up, inflation goes up as well. Personally, I’m just sad that budget cuts forced the Avengers to opt for simple dynamite instead of nuclear-powered Mach-5 flying suits.

**Black Problems**

India has a huge second economy that deals with black money. That’s news to nobody. But a new study has [pegged](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/new-study-pegs-black-money-in-india-at-rs-30-lakh-crore/story/233395.html) the size of that black economy at an astounding 20% of GDP or over ₹30 lakh crore (that’s 3 followed by 13 zeroes). And that just happens to be bigger than the overall economic size of countries like Thailand or Argentina. While the size of India’s black economy expanded rapidly during the 70s and 80s, it has been gradually declining since then. Today, most of this money is locked up in physical assets like real estate or gold. Due to obvious reasons, there are no official figures but experts say that as much as 30% of India’s real estate sector is funded by black money. Really, only in economics can you root for the supremacy of white over black and not be called a ~~Donald Trump supporter~~ racist.

**The Curious Case Of Missing GDP**

How does a 7.9% growth in GDP sound to you? If you ask the average joe on the streets, he won’t know what is what. But if you ask the fairly well-read joe on the streets, he’ll tell you that a 7.9% growth rate is amazing. But what about a 3.9% growth in GDP? Now, that’s bad. Official numbers released last week say that India’s GDP in the March quarter grew by 7.9%. But wait, there’s more. The accuracy of those numbers has been [called](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/kvvDHfbryOQjvu2l16UcEI/Discrepancies-drive-GDP-growth.html) into question. When you break GDP down into its components, sometimes the data doesn’t add up. It’s life. Sometimes, things just don’t add up. So this gap is then plugged by calling the missing portion as a ‘discrepancy’. As long as this discrepancy doesn’t get too big, all is well. But the amount of discrepancy in the latest numbers has shot up by over 350%. And if you remove the amount put under ‘discrepancy’, GDP growth rate falls from 7.9% to 3.9%. Faking GDP numbers? Come on guys, that’s not our job. That’s China’s [job](http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/china-fake-economic-data/).


**Economic Story Because Export and Import**

Nuclear weapons are serious business. Emphasis on serious rather than business. Although a handful of companies do make money off the nuclear power business. When sensitive nuclear technology falls in the wrong hands, you have rogue nations like North Korea and when it falls in the right hands... well, there really aren’t any right hands for nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a group of 48-countries that controls the export and import of goods that can be used to make a nuclear weapon. The NSG does this to ensure that nuclear technology doesn’t fall in the wrong hands. But India is not one of its 48 members. One of the reasons we are not invited to parties thrown by the NSG is because we have nuclear weapons but haven’t signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is an international agreement designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. This is a sore point with a lot of countries like China who are against India joining the NSG. However, being being friends with the United States, the world’s superpower does come with a lot of benefits. A US-led push to include India in the NSG is [picking](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-nuclear-idUSKCN0YV13Z) up steam as nations like South Africa and Turkey are coming around to supporting India’s bid for a membership. Here’s the irony - the only reason the NSG even exists as an international group, is because India tested nuclear weapons in the 70s and that rustled some jimmies in the international community.

* Government offices spend around 10-20% of non-plan expenditure or roughly 1.4 lakh crore on routine office purchases like cups and saucers to laptops and printers. And the government’s purchasing arm is [considering](http://www.businessinsider.in/Government-e-Marketplace/articleshow/52652285.cms) a portal called GeM (Government e-Marketplace) that’ll let employees buy routine office purchases online. Basically, they’re making a clone of Flipkart. Because you know, using Flipkart is just too mainstream now.

* The Tata Group of companies is a big group of companies. They’ve got companies tucked away in every nook and cranny of the economy - a total of close to 100 companies, of which only 30 companies are listed on the stock exchange. That number is set to become 31, as the group [revived](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/tata-technologies-revives-ipo-plan-likely-to-raise-rs-1400-crore/articleshow/52664433.cms) plans of an IPO for Tata Technologies, the engineering and IT arm of Tata Motors. If this goes through, it’ll also be the first IPO from the Tata Group in 12 years after TCS in 2004.

* The US-India Business Council counts the big boys of the global industry like Boeing, PepsiCo, MasterCard and many more as its members. And collectively, these big boys are [investing](http://www.firstpost.com/world/modi-terms-india-new-engine-of-growth-usibc-sees-45-bn-investment-2822448.html) a total of $45 billion on expanding operations in India. It’s not just one big cheque, they’ll invest over a few years. Amazon, a member of the Council as well as a big boy, committed to investing an extra $3 billion in addition to $2 billion already invested in Amazon India. The $5 billion funding will take Amazon India past the combined funding raised by both local rivals, Flipkart and Snapdeal. 

* A hot, young investment banker in London just bought a new Jaguar Land Rover car nicknamed the ‘baby Jag’ in all cash upfront. A trucker in Uttar Pradesh just scraped together enough money to buy a light Tata truck hoping that ferrying cargo from city to city will pay for his son’s education. What do those two people have in common? They both [contributed](http://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/domestic-turnaround-jlr-boost-tata-motors-net-profit-three-fold/941818) to the tripling of profit for the March quarter at Tata Motors to ₹5,177 crore.

Earlier this year, the Indian government once again tried to get the famed Kohinoor diamond back from the UK and failed. Citing that it would set an “unworkable precedent”, UK Prime Minister David Cameron [refused](http://www.newsweek.com/kohinoor-diamond-india-colonialism-449951) to return the stone, which has been claimed by the governments of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan at various points as well. That didn’t pan out quite well. But how do 200 statues and sculptures sound instead of 1 big fat diamond? The US  is [returning](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/07/us/stolen-artifacts-returned-india/) more than 200 artifacts that were stolen and smuggled out and eventually just ended up in the hands of the US government. Some of them are as old as 2,000 years and are worth over $100 million.

The government has, for the first time in history, [declared](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/03/india-will-have-surplus-power-for-the-first-time-ever-report) that it will not have a shortage of electricity this year. Baring the small matter of authorities often choosing to black out certain areas to hide demand, from June onwards, the country will have more electricity than required. Psh. Power cut. Shmower Cut.

I  thought that the actual numbers would be 6 or 5. But 3.9!!! Boy is that scary. > The US is returning more than 200 artifacts that were stolen and smuggled out and eventually just ended up in the hands of the US government. 

Yes, because they are required by U.S. law to do so. That they chose the opportune moment and occasion is because they are also the world's largest PR agency. >When you break GDP down into its components, sometimes the data doesn’t add up. It’s life. Sometimes, things just don’t add up. So this gap is then plugged by calling the missing portion as a ‘discrepancy’. 

This is absolute bollocks. I don't think you don't know what the discrepancy term means. Why are you misleading people?

For those who don't know, ""discrepancy"" is just the difference between the two estimates of GDP the government gets using two different methods – expenditures method and GVA method. Both the calculations are done by the government only, and therefore there is no inherent reason to trust one number more than the other.

In fact, according to some economists, the expenditures data on quarterly basis is pretty shabby and unreliable, so that is the one we should be deemed less trustworthy. I would give it to OP, because the discrepancy data is being qouted around quite a lot. It's not a good thing, but it certainly doesn't mean the GDP is infact 3.9%
In a country like india, its tough to find the numbers collected through expenditure, and hence we, like most countries, report production (read GVA) numbers as our GDP. Ideally they should be equal (infact, production, expenditure and income approach should reach the same number. The difference is reported as a discrepancy.

While it is indeed curious as to why did it skyrocket to that figure in this qaurter, it doesn't automatically discredit GDP figures. Infact, there are worse things going on to discredit it (WPI use in deflator, profits vs sales numbers, GVA in manufacturing and IIP numbers)

Though, this discussion is subpar, the discrepancy portion is tackled very well. Give it a hear.

"Want to become independent, but depressed cos of dad. Please help!",13,5um9dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5um9dt/want_to_become_independent_but_depressed_cos_of/,16,"I am 22 years old. Living in Thailand with parents. Only child. But my dad loves his elder brother and his family more. He keeps sending them money and always says we don't have money to go traveling, do shopping, etc. His nephew (elder son of tauji) is who he favors the most. Always sending him money and making sure he lives a comfortable life in Mumbai with his family while we keep sacrificing. Today the nephew's son turned one month old, and my dad especially went to India just cos they had a function (most likely my dad sponsored it). I joined my family business, but now I regret it cos my dad 24x7 thinks about his brother and nephew in India. I want to move back to India and live alone because I am pretty sure once my dad is no more, he will name everything to my nephews name, and me and my mom will have nothing to us. I have a BBA in Finance, but the only work experience I have is working as a salesperson in my family business of loose diamonds. I am also self-teaching web development to switch career. What can I do to become independent and not rely on my dad like his brother and nephew? I have zero self-esteem cos thanks dad! Please help.",nosleepnomore," There is no money in web development unless you are an excellent coder and have exceptional photoshop skills. Please don't make that switch! Lmao just talk to him .


Ask him if you're adopted since you don't feel like he loves you ( will at least shock him that his son feels that way ) . 

Just an idea  What the hell, that's so weird. 

I am 100% sure there is more to this story. Why would anyone be more concerned about their brother's child than their own? And he thinks about them all the time? There's something else going on here 


You should try to find out why. This is not normal  Work in your dad's business. You are 22 - your dad is probably around 50. There is still probably some time before your dad dies & before you need to worry about who gets the business etc. So best is to work with your dad - if you don't inherit his business - you will at least learn the business. Consider inheritance as a bonus not something necessary. What does your mother say to this? Are you sure you're not being poisoned by your mother? Ask him to pen down his will. You will have your answer. If you want return on your investment on the present company ask him to transfer partial ownership to you. If he shies away sighting meaningless stuff then sue his ass. It may break your family but then that's happening already.

After this all has happened then go and see a counsellor. Open your brain and listen to what i m gonna say to you ,
Firstly WTF, i found most of the advises on this page very retarded, i mean ""talk to you father""  lol seriously ?! so don't blindly do what these comments say.
Now, the solution i m gonna give to you would maybe considered lil bit fuckedup from these people's standards.

But what i m gonna say to you is the most pro-survival thing to do :-

First off you need some leverage against you dad, i don't know how stuff works around in thailand but i hear corruption is pretty normal their too , so you need to find out is your father doing anything illegal or not, any kind of money defaulter or something .
The least you do is have all and Every piece of legal document's copy , not just business ownership documents, i m talking about all the receipts and the data that is stored in the computer, scan/take a photo of it , copy the computer data  save it all in a secret pen drive or upload it as a smart person (encrypted obviously) .
In case u don't find anything favorable to you , you need to get in his goodest graces in the next few months and indirectly suggest him some illegal things/money default, if he do it than have proof of it by all means.

secondly, what is the dynamics of your family , does your father hate your mom, maybe you are not his son, or maybe your cousin is his son, you should atleast suspect these things for once .

Even if those things are not true ,you can secretly spread rumors in mumbai about your cousin being your father's son and how your father pay to his elder brother to continue his ""mumbai visits"" , if your ""tauji"" and ""taiji"" have any kind of stress in their relationship than you can consider this whole thing as the final nail to this problem, and if it doesn't work than you always have a leverage against you dad.

Althou i warn you, if you don't have the cunnings to do it Don't bother doing it at all, it would backfire at you like a mutherfukher.

**Banks - Mo’ Money, No Problems**

Two major private sector banks, Axis and HDFC, reported results for the quarter ending June and it’s a mixed bag. The bad loans crisis [continued](http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/axis-bank-q1-results-net-profit-bad-loans-on-july-22-2016/325755/) to hit Axis Bank where profits fell by 21%. But HDFC Bank, which mostly focuses on retail borrowers, [managed](http://in.reuters.com/article/hdfc-bank-results-idINKCN1010ML) to entirely miss the crisis as profits were up by 20%. However, the bag isn’t so mixed when it comes to public sector banks which are riddled with problems. The government’s got 99 problems, and 98 of them probably involve the banking sector in one way or another. Now, one way to solve problems is to just throw money at the problem. And 13 public sector banks just [received](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-allocates-rs-22915-cr-for-psu-bank-re-capitalization_7065221.html) about ₹22,915 crore of cash from the government. A back of the envelope calculation says if they had delivered all that cash physically, it would weigh about 275 kgs. Yes, I did the math. After reserving a lot of money to treat the bad loans problem, the banks didn’t have much remaining to lend out to borrowers. And if banks stop lending money, the entire economy grinds to a halt. So the new capital given by the government is supposed to help them get back into the lending game again. The largest recipient of this capital infusion was our largest bank, the State Bank of India that got about ₹7,575 crore. However, this is only a “capital infusion” and definitely not a “bailout”. Who even said bailout? There’s no bailout here. What bailout?

**ELI5 - GST**

GST - You know it’s a thing. But you don’t have a single clue what it’s about. The only time you hear about it is while changing channels on the TV. And from your drunk uncle at wedding receptions who thinks he’s an expert in politics. The Goods and Services Tax is probably the most important tax reform of this decade. It replaces a whole bunch of indirect taxes such as the VAT, Service Tax or Excise Duty. So instead of paying ten taxes at ten places, you only pay one tax at one place. And cutting down on that paperwork starts a domino effect of good things for the economy. At least that’s the theory. But the bill has been stuck in Rajya Sabha for a long time now. So what’s the big hold up? Political parties have been negotiating the finer details of the bill and the negotiations are taking a little more time than everybody expected. Some sore points of disagreement are whether to place a maximum limit of 18% above which the GST tax rate cannot be raised, whether to levy a 1% surcharge on interstate trade and how to resolve any disputes in the process. But now, if you feel like you aren’t getting enough of our beloved parliamentarians that are so hard at work solving our problems in penthouses all around Delhi, then fear no more. Because the government is [planning](http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/gst-hopes-brighten-as-congress-signals-support-bjp-ready-for-debate-in-rajya-sabha_1908866.html) a 5-hour-long debate in the Rajya Sabha aiming to resolve all disputes and pass the bill once and for all. That’s right, back to back five hours of bickering old men in white clothes - without any commercial breaks.

**Tesla to go desi?**

The pollution in Delhi has reached such an alarming level that if a Delhi resident starts smoking 10 packs of cigarettes a day and garnishing his food with powered nicotine while sleeping in a chamber full of passive tobacco smoke, he’ll probably still die of asthma from the polluted air before the lung cancer gets to him. And then there’s Delhi CM Mr. Kejriwal who recently hinted at the possibility of the torturous odd-even rule returning back to Delhi during the upcoming winters to curb pollution. What the city clearly needs is a whole bunch of emission-free electric cars. And accordingly, the government’s making moves to get Tesla, the car company famous for its electric cars to come to India. Apart from offering to promote joint ventures between Tesla and Indian car companies, the government is even [offering](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/tesla-and-make-in-india-a-roadway-to-cleaner-and-greener-india-but-how-soon-326205.html) Tesla land near major ports so it can Make in India and export to other Asian countries as well. However, the pipe dream of driving a Tesla down the national highways is unlikely to come true for at least a few years. Until then, we’ve got to find other ways to reduce pollution. Such as banning all diesel vehicles older than 10 years, which is what the National Green Tribunal just did. NGT, a top environmental court, has [directed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-autos-court-idUSKCN0ZY12P) Delhi transport authorities to de-register any diesel vehicles older than 10 years, and car companies couldn’t be happier.

~~**Tollywoodonomics**~~  **Kollywoodonomics**

Rajinikanth, the Amitabh Bachchan of the South, was out with his latest movie *Kabali*, which opened last Friday in 6,500 theaters, many of which were sold out for the entire weekend. In the movie industry, you’re only as good as your last flop - and in Rajini’s case, his last movie was *Lingaa* and before that, *Kochadaiiyaan* - both of which - well, let's just say that they haven’t exactly been Spielberg material. So you’d think producers would think twice before betting on this next film - but this Rajini we are talking about. He doesn’t follow the laws of economics. The laws of economics follow Ra... okay, yeah, those jokes stopped being funny 10 years ago. But still, people literally pour milk on huge cutouts of this guy. So producers went all in and funded Kabali with a budget of ₹110 crore. Here’s the kicker - the movie had already [earned](http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/how-rajinikanths-kabali-has-earned-rs-200-crore-days-before-its-release-2902140.html) ₹200 crore even before being released. Music rights, overseas rights, satellite rights and all other kinds of rights had already earned the movie a ton of cash before being released. How much did Rajini make off the movie? The actor was reportedly [paid](http://www.catchnews.com/regional-cinema/revealed-this-is-how-much-rajinikanth-charged-for-kabali-movie-news-rajinikanth-kabali-fees-revealed-1469024603.html) ₹35 crore as acting fees plus he’s set to receive another ₹45 crore from first week collections of the movie at the box office. Rajini being Rajini, theaters were sold out but prices for tickets in black ranged up to ₹1,500 with reports saying fans were ready to pay as much as ₹5,000 for tickets. All of this only points to one thing - at 65-years old, Rajini’s still got some swag.

However, mobile internet packs have stood the test of drought to become best-sellers across rural India. Which, I believe, can be taken as conclusive evidence that even farmers in far-reaching corners of rural India love browsing aww-worthy cat photos on the internet. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, the hardest hit company, is wiping its tears of sadness with the $1.4 billion it earned in profits just last quarter.

**Last Week On Rajan Watch**

Last year, PM Modi called RBI Governor Rajan as the “best teacher” for explaining complex economic issues to him. Days later, Rajan said the teaching went both ways. Aww. But the bromance doesn’t end there. Reports saying the PM is “proud” of Rajan surfaced last week [stating](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rajan-insight-idUSKCN0YM2SC) that any campaign against Rajan will not affect the big decision that he needs to make on Rajan’s reappointment. That might’ve been a snide reference to MP Subramanian Swamy’s moves to remove Rajan, Swamy has even rebuked Rajan for “speaking like a grandfather” (what? with artificial teeth? I mean Rajan is already 53, while Swamy is 76). Being best buds with Modi will definitely help Rajan secure his governorship at the RBI for a second term. But then, later in the day, reports [surfaced](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-doesnt-want-extension-media-report/articleshow/52536142.cms) that Rajan doesn’t even want to continue as Governor and would rather be a spectator in the game by going back to teach in the US and continue research on the Indian economy. Apparently, his family has already left. Somebody better buy the rights to this reality show - I’m personally hanging by the edge of my seat. Rajan is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the interest rate meeting this week. And the markets are expected to worry more about the “Rexit” - Rajan exiting the RBI than the interest rates this week. 

**Lincoln Could Only Do So Much**

When you have North Korea, Uzbekistan, Cambodia and Qatar at the top of a list - you pretty much know that the it isn’t the list of world’s happiest countries, it just has to be a list about something bad. Last week, India [shared](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-18-35-million-people-india-tops-global-slavery-index-1413891) a spot on such a list with all of these countries and it was the list that ranks countries in terms of slavery. Yikes. Owning a person might’ve gone out of fashion decades ago, but the trend is still alive - With a global figure of 46 million modern-day slaves, India is home to 18 million of those modern-day slaves followed by 3 million in China and 2 million in Pakistan that are implicated in domestic work, prostitution, manual labour, forced begging and so on. Even in manufacturing, working conditions at factories contribute a lot to the problem by essentially turning employees into slaves. Prominent for workplace [violations](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/01/gap-walmart-factory-workers-exploited-and-abused-in-india) are factories that supply global multinationals like Walmart or Gap. They’ve been known to have working conditions that don’t just border on exploitation - but are miles away from that border, deep into exploitation territory. Complaints include non-payment of wages, forced overtime work, inability to form unions, extreme health consequences that may be fatal due to lack of safety regulations and even sexual harassment. How’s that 9-to-5 desk job sounding now?

The stock market was friend-zoned not just by the PM, but by his cabinet as well. While the total assets of the top 9 ministers in the Indian government amounted to a staggering ₹91.1 crore, only 2% of them were invested in the stock market. The richest of the bunch was Arun Jaitley, perhaps appropriately the Finance Minister, who has total assets of ₹49.5 crore, a significant portion of which is just cold hard cash sitting as bank deposits. The poorest of the bunch was Suresh Prabhu, perhaps also appropriately the Railway Minister, who has total assets of mere ₹17 lakh. You want to talk about the gap between the rich and the poor? We’ve got that gap right here for you in government’s *navratnas*. 

**Time for Tim: Cook’s India Aftermath**

Tim came, Tim saw but Tim did not conquer. Tim Cook, Apple CEO, visited India a few weeks ago to much media fanfare and met several top government ministers. But to Tim’s disappointment, he failed to convince anyone to allow Apple to launch its famous retail iStores in India. Currently, Apple sells products through a network of dealers. That’s because under current regulations, if Apple wants to open retail stores, it needs to source 30% of content locally. Sourcing 30% locally means Apple would have to start manufacturing in India. Either that, or just buy stuff from local businesses and literally light it on fire. Neither of those things is about to happen. However, under current regulations, Apple can be granted a waiver to the 30% rule but only if Apple is bringing “cutting-edge” technology to India. And in the classic bureaucratic fashion, nobody actually bothered to define what “cutting-edge” would mean. And when you leave crucial terms like that open for interpretation, somewhere somehow a lawyer gets all excited. Now, Apple fanboys might disagree on this but government officials are unlikely to call any of Apple’s technology “cutting-edge” and are widely [expected](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/lDn53REhqvhqGoIxs9MgwJ/Apples-proposal-to-sell-refurbished-iPhones-in-India-reject.html) to decline Apple’s petition for a waiver of the 30% rule. The government is also not a big fan of Apple’s proposal to sell second-hand iPhones in India fearing that the country would become a graveyard for all old iPhones.

**Going Gaga Over GST**

Last week, the Rajya Sabha [passed](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/gst-bill-pass-what-next-step-by-step-until-the-rollout-2952723/) the Goods and Services Tax (GST) - the tax reform that has been heralded as the most important piece of legislation in over a decade. While the common market of Europe is walking backwards due to Brexit, the common market within India is stepping ahead due to GST. The bill has been the subject of political bickering for a long time now. However, it was passed with 203 votes for and none against. With 0 votes against. They didn’t even blink twice, so you know there families weren’t being held hostage and all votes were entirely voluntary. But this has only been the tip of the iceberg. Even though both houses of the parliament have passed the bill, there is a laundry list of things that need to happen before we can all go home and forget about this whole GST business. The Lok Sabha needs to approve the bill once again. Then, a minimum of 15 state governments need to pass the bill. Then, the president needs to sign the bill. Then, a GST Council needs to be formed and the GST tax rate needs to be negotiated. Then, the central government needs to pass two supporting laws, and each state needs to pass a separate supporting law. And only then, we’ll be able to pocket all that cash from the GST-led economic growth that is being predicted. The deadline set for all of this is April 1st, 2017. Till then, government officials around the country are set to debate on extremely sensitive issues like whether cream biscuits should be taxed at the same rate as ordinary biscuits. #TeamBourbon.

**Uber-Didi**

Uber joined the long list of American MNCs that came to do business in China but inevitably fell on their faces. In a deal announced last week, the popular ride-hailing service will sell its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in [exchange](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/business/dealbook/china-uber-didi-chuxing.html?_r=0) for a 20% stake in Didi, who will invest $1 billion in Uber. The two giants have been battling for the Chinese market for years and despite spending billions of dollars, no one has managed to turn a profit. In fact, Uber was facing a loss of $1 billion annually due to heavy competition in China. Once upon a time, Uber’s future in China seemed to hold promise. And now, the company is throwing in the towel. The company’s mistake? It tried to fight a land war in Asia. Although Didi was the bigger company in China in terms of market share, Uber did have its moments. Such as when a Chinese hip-hop artist posted a gangster rap song about how much he prefers Uber. Don’t Baidu it - China being China censored the whole thing just days later.

**Loans For *Pani Puri wala*s**

Banks use all sorts of fancy algorithms to determine if a borrower will repay a loan. Despite all of that, with the banking crisis, a huge amount of loans are at a risk of being Vijay Mallya-ed. So the fancy algorithms haven’t exactly worked out. Another one of those fancy things that banks use is a credit score. A good credit score will have banks lining outside your door shouting for your attention. A bad credit score will have you lining outside the door of the banks with a ton of paperwork. You need a good credit score to get loans. But to get a good credit score, you need to repay loans. So you see the chicken-and-egg problem here. This means a lot of people don’t even have credit scores. But those people still need loans. And banks won’t touch them with a ten-foot pole. Now, microfinance companies like Edelweiss, Bharat Financial, DHFL and many more are going places feared by the big boys of finance. A big push in the industry is to loan [money](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/saturated-cities-now-even-idli-vada-seller-can-get-loan/articleshow/53515598.cms) to pavement hawkers, scrap dealers and other self-employed individuals. For example - the makers of the extremely healthy chinese food at the hand-kart that parks near the local sewer every evening. Basically, giving loans to low-income borrowers without a credit score or any kind of formal financial history. If that sounds like a recipe for trouble, that’s because it is and we’ve already had that dish in the run-up of the financial crisis of 2008. And if history isn’t repeating itself here, it’s definitely rhyming.


**Too Many Branches Spoil The Bank**

The State Bank Of India has almost 17,000 branches which is very impressive. Especially since they get to brag about it in tables that rank banks by number of branches. But the bank isn’t doing itself any favours by putting 5 branches within a 1 km radius of each other, as is the case a lot of times with SBI. Because sometimes, it’s not the size that matters, it’s what you do with it that matters. And SBI is [considering](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-weighs-plan-to-shut-relocate-30-of-its-branches/articleshow/53494912.cms) a proposal to do away with such extra branches by consolidating them. It might make common sense to shut down branches when put like that, but then they won’t get to brag about how many branches they have. And investors love those kind of things. SBI is currently in the process of merging with its associate banks from Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore and so on. It expects to have that completed by March 2017. At which point, that 17,000 number will balloon up to 24,000 branches, compounding that problem. A global consulting firm, McKinsey which was hired by SBI has recommended shutting down upto of 7,200 of those branches. Moreover, bank branches are so *2000s*. Online is where it’s at.

RBI slashed the interest rate on credit card dues after I sent a petition to the Honorable Prime Minister,312,2vw8p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2vw8p6/rbi_slashed_the_interest_rate_on_credit_card_dues/,61,"Last year in May 2014, I had sent a letter about profiteering by Indian banks to the Prime Minister's Office, on the day when Mr Narendra Modi took charge. This letter mentioned several points about how banks were exploiting consumers. Some were even charging money for cash withdrawals and for counting currency. I also suggesting ways and means to make life easier for entrepreneurs and tax payers.

The entire letter can be found on my blog.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/18/letter-mr-narendra-modi-prime-minister-india-prevent-profiteering-indian-banks-and-make-lif

After over 35 years of credit cards being introduced in India, RBI has asked all banks to bring down interest rates. For all these years there has never been a cap on how much interest credit card companies could charge. Now, there will be. I'm amazed the way Modi ji and his government has acted to protect the interest of banking customers who have been exploited for decades by banks and credit card companies.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Interest-on-card-dues-set-to-drop/articleshow/46225962.cms

This was covered by Business World magazine

http://www.businessworld.in/news/banking/how-to-stop-profiteering-by-banks-&-make-life-easier-for-taxpayers/1381616/page-0.html

The Prime Minister's office (PMO) sent me a reply a few weeks later, turning my letter into a petition. A few months later I received two replies from the Reserve Bank of India and one reply from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) addressing the capital market reforms I had suggested.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/22/sebi-sends-me-letter-responding-my-letter-honorable-prime-minister

One of the arguments that I put forth in my letter was about excessive interest rates being charged on credit card outstanding dues. To quote from my letter;

*The credit card division of banks needs to be looked at very seriously. Most banks that issue credit cards charge anywhere between 24% and 36% per annum as interest on the funds lent. Most people are not financially very savvy and this sends them into a debt trap. There is no justification for charging 36% on credit card advances when a loan to buy a scooter can be given at 15%.*

With this move, the RBI has implemented my suggestion. To quote the RBI report; *'Interest rates charged on credit card overdue were inordinately high and out of alignment with other products with similar risk profiles'.* The decision on trimming charges was taken at a conference attended by bank ombudsmen and the top rung of the RBI, which included governor Raghuram Rajan. The conference resulted in action points being drawn for the Indian Banks' Association. 

It is very heartening to see the agility with which the government has responded to my suggestions. This will, I hope, go a long way in giving a fair deal to banking consumers, increasing their purchasing power and improving the quality of life of the common man.

I also wrote a letter last month to the Honorable Finance Minister suggesting a Janta Credit Card, to eliminate black money from the economy. Please read it.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/23/my-letter-honorable-finance-minister-shri-arun-jaitley-suggesting-janta-credit-card-elimina

I'm hopeful that the PM and FM will consider implementing this solution. Apart from eliminating black money, it can go a long way towards ensuring inclusive growth, reducing the gap between the haves and have-nots, increasing India's competitiveness and ensuring employment and GDP growth.

**tl;dr: I sent a letter to the Honorable Prime Minister offering several suggestions to counter profiteering by banks, encourage entrepreneurship and reform taxation. One of the suggestions was to slash the interest rate on credit card dues. This was implemented yesterday, 35 years after credit cards were introduced in India. For the first time in our history we may actually have a cap on credit card interest rates in our country.**",vikkramm200," My children will thank you op. Great intiative. As someone who has been in credit card debt and a bachelor of economics, I thank you. After fighting HDFC for 9 months and threatening to sue several times, the bank finally agreed to reverse unjustified charges they had been levying.

Basically, they had turned on an auto debit feature wherein my credit card dues were automatically deducted from my HDFC account every month. However, my HDFC account has always been dormant and never held any money, and my relationship manager knew this. So every time it would auto debit and every time it would fail, they would charge me 600 rupees for the failed transaction. This amounted to several thousands in just a few months.

Banks are profit-driven institutions. They are not here for financial support, they are here for business.  Thank you man. I could not understand half of it, besides the bit that CC holders were being charged gaand faadu interest rates. Good to know that you actually did something about it, and very good to know that your suggestions were taken up by Modi and hence RBI, and letter did not go in the bin. BC 36% rate is too fucking much. 

You can change the website layout a bit, will be easy on the eye.  Well done man.  Good job OP. Nice one on the Modi Government too. 

Let's hope some media mentions this article as signs that the government takes people's opinions seriously and acts on it. uplifting news of the day.

Great work OP, you actually did something about the problem you faced/felt need to do something about.

And a government did what it is supposed to be doing. All in all, nice work. Good job op..  I am still wondering how many letter the pm gets and he not only forwards them but keeps track of them and gets things done.. 

Mark my words he will beat ABV and become the best PM of India  Thank you everyone for your kind words.

+/u/dogetipbot 200 doge verify What a great uplifting news to start my day. Kudos to both of you & gov. You did something, sent a letter. Instead of just ranting out. OTHO, PMO was responsive! That's really good to hear. The fact that PM responded to your letter and started a petition makes me happy. 

If anything, this is one of those acche din :)

(Now waiting for jurnos to copy this story. A man sent a letter to PM, you will be amazed to know what happened next) Good stuff OP and an appreciable action from the govt. Kudos Vikram, another step towards a better future. Good job OP. I hope RBI,, govt and SEBI also cracks down on micro loan companies that charge ridiculous interest rates. Most of the people who take micro loans are poor people but the interest rates they are asked to pay is just terrible. well done, OP, even well done modi sarkaar. 

I like it when a govt responds to citizens This is great. Active citizen and responsible government. That's how a nation is supposed to work. Thanks for sharing this. If i wore a hat i would doff it off - at your sheer awesomeness.

Keep up the good fight, mate - and may your future endeavors meet with similar success. TIL writing letter works, Whoring on change.org does not! Great work. 

This inspires me to send a letter to the Honorable Prime Minister to do something about atrociously worded gender biased laws in the country.  amazing to know that your letter and suggestions were taken seriously. Thumbs Up to Modiji

Although, it is not a good idea to spend money you do not have.  >We must have lower interest rates for borrowers with a good credit history, rated by CIBIL (Credit Information Bureau Limited).


You do, its called a personal loan at I think 18% or so

>When this happens, more and more people will own and habitually use credit cards. The boom in the US during the 1950s and 60s was driven by consumption.

Having people use credit cards for credit is not desirable...  

>The government, on its part, must consider offering a credit card; a 'Janta Credit Card' via the public sector banks such as The State Bank of India. These credit cards can be backed by a fixed deposit or a personal guarantee, making the risk of default minimal. The lending rate can be very close to the bank's deposit rates. With this, the penetration of credit cards will increase exponentially. 

Already covered by debit cards is it not? Whats the additional value of a credit card here?

>There are many small traders who deal only in cash and issue little worthless slips of paper as invoices and receipts. Greater usage of credit cards will make it very difficult for such small traders, small retailers and restaurants to conceal transactions and evade taxes, thereby sharply increasing the direct and indirect tax collections.


Completely agree, but between the mandatory account scheme and RuPay cards, isnt all this covered?

If the govt instead severely limited ATM cash withdrawals on the crores of 0 balance accounts they are giving out, it would do a lot to accomplish this goal > I also suggesting ways and means to make life easier for entrepreneurs and tax payers.

Good times for entrepreneurs, businessmen and taxpayers.  Can someone explain why doesnt this happen already as a result of free market forces - basically why doesnt someone just open a pseudo-bank and take big 'personal' loans from existing banks at 15% and then reloan them to credit card customers at say 18% ?

My guess is it is maybe because the banking sector is over-regulated - in which case I would have to say that the person to blame here is not the banks but the govt. itself. Kudos to the OP and the government. But it's a pity that even when the problem is known and the government has good intentions it takes so long for corrective action to be implemented.

BTW I notice that a certain group of posters(the ones who troll threads with bottom-rated 'Dear Leader' and 'Acche Din' comments) are conspicuously absent from this thread. It appears they follow the creed *'If you can't say anything nice then don't say anything at all.'* Good. Great job! You are a true citizen!! :) Great work. This just shows what one determined person can do. You have done good OP :) OP delivered! Thank you!  Sab mile hue hain I still don't see evidence that RBI made the decision solely based on your suggestion. The whole post is so self-promotional that it is almost cringe-inducing.",Business/Finance,2015-02-15 02:47:36

**Big Oil To Get Fatter**

One of the ideas being thrown around to deal with the bad loans crisis was merging all 27 state-owned banks to make 6 really huge banks. Taking inspiration from that idea, the government is now throwing around another idea - [merging](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-set-to-start-talks-on-merging-13-state-oil-companies-to-create-behemoth/articleshow/53371857.cms) 13 big state-owned oil companies to make 1 really huge oil company. Companies like ONGC, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum lead the list of the 13 companies being considered for this mega-merger. Even as oil prices nearly committed suicide last year, just the top 6 state-owned oil companies still managed to report revenues of ₹9.3 trillions. So clearly, the 1 giant oil company that will come out of these mergers will be big enough to rival the likes of UK’s BP and Russia’s Rosneft. But it will still be a few ranks smaller than some of the biggest oil companies in the world. And at least when it comes to business, size does matter. This idea of merging oil companies isn’t a new idea - it’s been brought up and shot down numerous times in the past mainly due to concerns over reduced competition. Mergers are extra difficult for government companies because after every merger, there’s some extra fat that you have to trim. But government companies tend to focus on social welfare before profit - which means keeping that extra fat to pump up employment in the country. Even if the prospect of this 1 giant oil company with trillions in revenue seems huge right now, rest assured, it won’t be bigger than *yo mama*.

**Gone Are The Days Of Jabong**

The e-commerce industry made multiple headlines last week - the biggest story being the acquisition of Jabong. Flipkart-owned Myntra went shopping around for companies and [dropped](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/rocket-internets-jabong-sold-to-flipkart-owned-rival-myntra-for-70m/) $70 million on Jabong, creating the largest online fashion company. The second-highest bidder for Jabong was Snapdeal which offered $50 million followed by Future Group (that owns the Big Bazaar stores) which offered $35 million. It’s been a tough couple of years for Jabong. Even Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla of the e-commerce business, briefly considered acquiring Jabong for $1 billion back in 2014. Compared to that price tag, Flipkart got a nice discount of 93%. However, the days aren’t as rosy as they sound for Flipkart. Exhibit A - the company just [fired](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/start-ups/article-flipkart-to-lay-off-hundreds-of-underperforming-employees-report-1437780) about 700 employees and tried to play it off as “a fairly common practice”. Exhibit B - Industry reports released last week indicate that Amazon has [surpassed](http://www.firstpost.com/business/most-consumers-preferred-amazon-over-flipkart-for-online-transactions-in-2016-says-survey-2915798.html) Flipkart to become India’s preferred online destination. Exhibit C - Snapdeal reached 1 million daily transacting users, more than those of Flipkart and Amazon put together. Seems like bad news does come in threes.

**RIO MMXVI**

The 2016 Olympic Games are set to begin next week in Brazil. As the media begins extensive coverage of the events, get ready for the millions of Indians that will be shocked to find out about the existence of sports other than cricket and fighting trolls online. Just as the international media came at India with pitchforks drawn for botching up the 2010 Commonwealth Games, let’s turn those pitchforks around and poke other countries for mismanaging international sporting events. The host nation, Brazil is going through its worst economic crisis since 1930 and its worst health crisis since 1918. The country’s GDP contracted by 4% in 2015, and is expected to [contract](http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-02-22/budget-rio-olympics-16-times-higher-budget-combat-zika-virus) by another 3% in 2016. Plus there’s the small matter of Zika viruses roaming around giving birth defects to unborn babies. Technically, the country doesn’t have a President since the most recent one was suspended under charges of corruption. Considering all of that, just the fact that Brazil hasn’t descended into anarchy is an achievement. The government has allocated $9.7 billion for the Olympic Games, which is 16 times more than the budget allocated to deal with the Zika virus that has already infected 1.5 million Brazilians. Hashtag Priorities. However, every Olympic Game since 1968 has exceeded its budget by an average of 179% which means that $9.7 billion could very well balloon up to $17 billion. Godspeed Brazil, godspeed.

**News Flash: Old Age Is Tough**

Most people’s idea of preparing for retirement includes investing in 1) Fixed Deposits, 2) Mutual Funds or 3) A kid or two. But a survey by the investment bank HSBC [found](http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/finance/47-indians-not-saving-for-retirement-hsbc_1908299.html) that 47% of the working people in India haven’t even started saving for retirement. No need to panic - the global average is around the same at 46% - so the rest of the world is as deep in this swamp as India. The HSBC survey also found the 80% of Indians seek advice about retirement from friends and family - which basically means that your primary source of information about retirement is that one balding uncle you have who walks around with a beer belly and midlife crisis. That’s just one survey. Here’s another - the annual Global Retirement Index published by Natixis, one of the biggest asset management companies in France, [ranked](http://qz.com/737382/india-is-the-worst-place-in-the-world-to-retire-2/) India as the 43rd best country to retire. That doesn’t seem so bad until you realize that the Index only tracks 43 countries to begin with, and India finished last. Dispelling any notions that India finished last due to all the nice guys in the country, the index mentioned the pitiful state of India’s healthcare system as one of the reasons that we finished last. Meanwhile, Norway and Switzerland were ranked as the best places to retire.

**The Rain Gods Want Beer And IPL**

Maharashtra is suffering from a major drought, which is a big deal because hospitals in the severely hit areas have had to cancel operations due to water shortages. It’s so bad that SS* President Uddhav Thackeray has [asked](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/maharashtra-drought-water-crisis-latur-govt-should-stop-water-supply-to-beer-units-in-view-of-drought-shiv-sena-chief-2756485/) the government to stop supplying water to breweries in the state. There’s more. The Mumbai High Court has also [ordered](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36038026) 13 IPL Cricket matches to move out of the state (cricket matches use up a ton of water). You know it’s bad when they go after cricket and beer. The rain gods got a wind of what was happening and have decided to stop the madness before riots break out. The Indian Meteorological Department, which predicts rainfalls among other things, has [predicted](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Economy-set-for-boost-as-Met-forecasts-above-normal-monsoon/articleshow/51802516.cms) “above normal” rainfall this year that may break the two-year long drought and help revive a weak farm economy. Take it with a grain of salt since these are only predictions but they have been supported by two private forecasters as well.

*Shiv Sena, not the Nazis.

**Some Good Numbers**

Several agencies just unloaded a big data dump and while the data isn’t always good, this time it is. Consumer Price Inflation [slowed](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/retail-price-inflation-slows/article8467622.ece) to 4.83% in March, the lowest it has been in 6 months. The price declines were led by the ‘food and beverage’ segment. Who doesn’t love cheap food? Industrial Output broke a 3-month negative streak to grow by 2% in February while electricity production grew by 10% in the same month. All those foreign tours are paying off - despite a decrease from 2014 numbers, recent numbers show India as the world’s largest remittance recipient in 2015 after NRIs [sent](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/India-is-top-remittance-recipient-of-2015-World-Bank/articleshow/51822766.cms) back $69 billion (₹459,988 crore) to families in India. Economists around the country are calling it the “Karan Johar effect”. But that also works the other way around - outward remittances from India grew by over 300% to reach $499 million (₹3,326 crore). Although bank deposits grew by 10%, it’s the slowest growth rate since 1963. But that could also indicate increased consumer spending which can be good for the economy - depends on if you’re a glass half-full or half-empty kind of person.

**No Smoking - Part 2**

Part 1 Recap: The size of the pictorial health warnings that go over cigarette packets was increased from 20% to 85%. Confusion over the decision prompted cigarette manufacturers including ITC ([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC)) to shut down all cigarette factories in protest. And now…

Part 2: Turns out - all that drama was over nothing. Cigarette manufacturers, having realized that the government can stay adamant longer than they can stay in business, have decided to [resume](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/itc-to-resume-cigarette-manufacturing/story/231126.html) cigarette manufacturing. But that doesn’t mean the end of this saga. While the mainstream cigarette brands have resumed production, now the traditional cigarette makers that make *beedis*, have [shut](http://in.reuters.com/article/tobacco-industry-supreme-court-appeal-idINKCN0XB1H6) down production because the “wrapping paper edges prevent printing on a reasonably large area of the curved surface”. The beedi industry employs more than 8.8 million Indians mostly in rural impoverished areas, who might be temporarily out of a job. A lawsuit challenging the size increase has already made its way to the Supreme Court which is set to hear the case on April 22nd.

Stay tuned for Part 3 - Coming Soon.

**TCS’s US Troubles**

A grand jury in the United States has [held](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/tcs-denies-ip-infringement-will-appeal-940-million-jury-award-in-us-trade-secrets-theft-case/articleshow/51855594.cms) Tata Consultancy Services ([TCS](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATCS)) in violation of copyright and intellectual property laws and asked the company to pay a fine of $940 million (₹6,266 crore). In October 2014, Epic Systems, an American healthcare software provider, filed a lawsuit accusing TCS of stealing trade secrets, confidential information and more than 6,000 secret documents in order to improve its own competing product called ‘Med Mantra’. And now, the jury has found that TCS did indeed do all those things. TCS, part of the Tata Group known for its integrity and ethics, has denied all allegations. Cheap ripoffs of Western products and brands is usually China’s ball game. But hey, if it works, why not? Except this time, it turned out to be not so cheap - $940 million is close to half of Epic Systems annual revenue.

**Greybull Capital To The Rescue!**

Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL)), after a year of intensive searching has found a scapegoat that’s willing to buy a part of its loss-making UK operations. The company is [selling](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/tatas-sell-uk-unit-to-greybull-for-1/235275/) a part of its failing business in the UK to private equity investor Greybull Capital (not to be confused with Red Bull, provider of wings). You don’t really understand the extent to which the Tatas were desperate until you hear that the UK business was sold for just a nominal sum of £1 (94 rupees) and the current pension obligations for employees will still stay with the Tatas. The search for buyers for the remaining parts of the business is still on. However, this has not scared the company off Europe in any way. Tata Steel was [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tata-steel-thyssenkrupp-idINKCN0XA0F0) to be in talks with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp (thi-sen-krup) to merge their European businesses under a joint venture.

I thought you wanted to keep politics out of these posts.(I LOLed at that though :D) Monday office gets lighter with this post. 30 minutes of leisure quality read. Amazing levels of Perseverance on display !

I want to ask one question: **Why are you doing this?** . Building up your credit score is fine, but what is the ultimate goal? Do note, that by me asking this question, in no way undermines my appreciation for your hard work! Do you have a bot to keep track of market and stock movements? We could also probably add Infosys' results! Liked the tip of the hat to Keynes. For those who did not get it, one of his more famous quotes is:  
  
The markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. You should also mention the unemployment numbers release by the Labour department. Great work, Dexter Is IDEA really a good network provider? I use Vodafone and man, does the coverage suck.  brilliant as always! you should open a blog Good work !

Career advice(switching stream from CA),8,7rbddh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7rbddh/career_adviceswitching_stream_from_ca/,1,"I'm 23 years old. Yesterday CA final results were announced and this is my 6th attempt (writing Ca final exams from 2015). I could not focus properly and I honestly don't have interest in finance field(first two levels of CA were easy for me and this final is like torture to me). I completed IGNOU BCOM(As regular BCOM is not allowed while pursuing CA). I will complete CMA(course like CA but relatively easy) this February. I am interested in technology. I self-learned various things like web development and IOT stuff. I would not get bored doing or experimenting these stuff. 

Are there any good short term courses either related to this stream like CISA (which includes IT+ Audit) or any other different stream altogether. how is business analytics course by [IIDT](http://www.iidt.edu.in/courses.php). I am depressed right now. 

I am worried about switching streams. Here in India people mostly give jobs based on your degree (at least eligibility is considered based on having certain degrees).

Presently keeping Chrome for this (and the few times something breaks only on chrome and I need to test that.) Wasn't there a news this week about the IITian dating platform shutting shop?

It's time for Indians to invest in Canada,0,7oony4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7oony4/its_time_for_indians_to_invest_in_canada/,3,"It's time for Indians to invest in Canada

Jagdish Pathak

There are more than one million Indian-origin immigrants in Canada. But compared to rising number of Indian-origin immigrants, Indian investment has not kept pace in Canada. However, slowly but steadily, Indian investments are trickling into the Canadian economy. Economic stability has become key to Canada's success and is decisive in attracting investors from all over the world to its shores. Investment in Canada is considered a safe haven for investors' hard-earned money and continues to represent a solid foundation for future growth and prosperity. 

Canada is the No. 1 investment destination in the G7 and was ranked 4th in the world as the best country to conduct business over the period 2010-14, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Ranking August 2010 report. 

Indian investors have still been shy about investing in Canada. Most investors from India prefer the UK and Europe as well as the countries of the Middle East, historically. Outside this region, Indian investments are scattered and limited. Canada is a stable, secure nation, and endowed with abundant natural resources. Its currency has always been very stable and its safest borders are with the largest economy of the world. Canada/US relations can be described as the best that any two nations can have. 

Canada ranks 27th in terms of FDI investment in India and its investments are mostly in the development sector. Whereas Indian FDI approved until 2009 in Canada is restricted to $570 million and ranks as the 20th destination of Indian investments. 

Recently, in Windsor, I saw a big hoarding on the road showing the name ""Aditya Birla"" on it. I stopped and looked at it with admiration, thinking, at last, Indian investors have made up their mind to make Canada their destination for good. 

Indian investors should consider Canada and especially the province of Ontario to be the hub of their North American business activities. Ontario has liberal laws, a huge existing infrastructure, and various tax benefits to investors, relatively milder climate, fertile farmlands and, without doubt, some of the best golf courses in the world in your neighborhood. 

People here are well aware of Indian investments in the automotive sector of the UK. During the purchasing phase of the Jaguar and Land Rover deal by Tata, India and its investors were commonly discussed in Ontario bars and restaurants. Ontario is the hub of automotive industries and support services for manufacturing automobiles of big-3: US and Japanese car manufacturers like Honda and Toyota. Southwestern Ontario is a key entry point for US and South American markets. 

Canadians are very knowledgeable about India and its information technology-related successes. India is no longer a nation of beggars and snake- charmers in the minds of a younger generation of Canadian citizens. Growth of the Indian software industry has made a big mark on the Canadian psyche. 

Any investment in Canada will have to be planned over the long term similar to US investors in the past. Canadian oil and energy, forestry, mines and minerals, and gold and diamond resources are some of the best resources for investors to look at. The Canadian higher education system is one of the best in the world and at par with the US, resulting in students from across the globe studying and performing high quality research. 

Investors from India are relatively conservative by nature and prefer to satisfy some critical marks before deciding to invest. Canada is one such country which should be the destination of long-term investors from India. One might look at some of the investments made by Indian investors in the Ontario province and think how much is there on offer in this well-endowed province alone. Investments by Essar group in energy and steel, by Mahindra Satyam and Wipro in the IT sector are a good beginning. However, the quantity of investment is negligible, compared to China, which is making substantial investment in the core sectors of oil and energy, solar and wind power generation and forestry. 

A strategic investment in developed nations like Canada goes with the Indian aspiration of becoming a global power. Indian investors can fulfill such desires in conjunction with the geo-political leadership potential of India.

Am just a normal internet user from some city of India and have been touring out in many different countries from last few years.

I really love my nation and while travelling I found that we have everything what other so called developed countries have than why are we still developing?

I generally came up with few more questions while browsing through so many social networking and news channels and other print media.

I Have 1 general question from all the citizens of this country, Don't you think that the only problem is we are been fooled by few politicians?

Why I came up with this question.
I don't think all other countries with such huge population are safest for women's or they don't have any crime happening or there are no bankrupt or jobless people roaming around, every country has this and this is just a part of it.

What makes difference.
Some countries have low population and so they have managed to have better law and low rate of law breakers, some countries are so open for sex and everything that they don't have sex taboo guys roaming around to harm girls, some countries high rate of literacy and there are huge tax payers and the government is so rich that in very average amount of tax also they manage to serve the best to country and there are some countries which has huge population but they work strictly on business and make more and more vacancies to leave less unemployment in the country.

Now what this country is working on?
I found that none of the political parties are actually trying to solve the issue or jobs and tax payers and if some think of trying it out (not only now but even when congress tried few better step) the oppositions and others just try to criticize them and they try best to fool people and get rid of this solutions and try to misguide the citizens of our country.

Root cause,
No political party is trying for the best awareness and is opened up for space for public voice.

Reason:
Everyone is scared of loosing there position.

I don't say demonetization is right or wrong i am just a common man who has not studied finance or i do not know how gst is effecting people because i was not a trader or so, but i know only one thing that if stop criticizing everything and work together for benefit even for next one 3-4 years i think this country would be most powerful and most dominating in the world in ever space.

With all this criticism, blame game, dirty politics we are not heading towards any solution we are in a loop of destruction we will always be behind few other countries and we will always be developing country because the condition of been developed country keeps varying every generation with the high end techs and literacy.

We need to work together for awareness, jobs, tax payers and food quality rather then seeing who is low level scammer or who is shouting higher.

Please be aware we are not moving towards development if this situation is continued and maximum people stay against government always.

I pardon for my language if i have misspelled or there is a grammatical issues, I am not a blog writer but i am really in pain with the way things are going and if we all don't stand to support any government in position all together we will always be in the same situation forever, and i think this is the right time to open eyes and start supporting because we need a government with majority and this is that government lets support them maximum and give a try we have no other option when you have to bare it anyways why not supporting while voting again don't vote them thats all. 

",khwajanawaz," > but i know only one thing that if stop criticizing everything and work together for benefit even for next one 3-4 years.

You want to live in a nation without exercising FoE that has its foundation in the following ethos:-

**WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN, SOCIALIST, SECULAR,DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:**

**JUSTICE, social, economic and political;**

**LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;** (very important)

**EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all**

**FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;**

**IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this 26th day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.**


>I don't say demonetization is right or wrong i am just a common man who has not studied finance or i do not know how gst is effecting people because i was not a trader.

But i am assuming that you want the best for your country? as you have pointed out that you love this nation- it won't hurt to get a basic grasp of such steps that are of acute national importance- your logic is like i can't celebrate Mangalyan as i have no knowledge of astrophysics. So get the basic idea of everything that happens in the nation and try understanding how it has affected the country...

another issue is you have asked not to criticise and work together for the nation- now you might not be not affected with the above mentioned incidents, but what about those who are? i guess you want that they just keep on working tirelessly forgetting about their problems, for the ""good of the nation""- well no, if i faced a problem (more life catastrophe for people who lost jobs, lives, %points in GDP growth, etc etc) i'd exercise my right to raise my voice.

>Please be aware we are not moving towards development if this situation is continued and maximum people stay against government always.

Being anti establishment is not being against the nation, it actually promotes an accountable Govt.

For example : Modi is not India, and India is not Modi, if i criticise Modi, doesn't mean i want him to fail...i just want him to be held responsible for the his 'executive' actions , and BJP/NDA for their ""legislative"" ones

Tl;Dr: you have a flawed logic my friend.

With a view to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities, and for eliminating Black Money ,Government decides to cancel the legal tender character of the High Denomination bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 from the expiry of the 8th November, 2016. 




            With a view to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities such as espionage, smuggling of arms, drugs and other contrabands into India, and for eliminating Black Money which casts a long shadow of parallel economy on our real economy, it has been decided to cancel the legal tender character of the High Denomination bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations issued by RBI till now. This will take effect from the expiry of the 8th November, 2016.
 
2.         Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) in circulation in these denominations are comparatively larger as compared to those in other denominations. For a common person, the fake notes look similar to genuine notes. Use of FICN facilitates financing of terrorism and drug trafficking. Use of high denomination notes for storage of unaccounted wealth has been evident from cash recoveries made by law enforcement agencies from time to time. High denomination notes are known to facilitate generation of black money.In this connection, it may be noted that while the total number of bank notes in circulation rose by 40% between 2011 and 2016, the increase in number of notes of Rs.500/- denomination was 76% and for Rs.1,000/- denomination was 109% during this period. New Series bank notes of Rs.500/- and Rs.2,000/- denominations will be introduced for circulation from 10th November, 2016. Infusion of Rs.2,000/- bank notes will be monitored and regulated by RBI. Introduction of new series of banknotes which will be distinctly different from the current ones in terms of look, design, size and colour has been planned.
 
3.         The World Bank in July, 2010 estimated the size of the shadow economy for India at 20.7% of the GDP in 1999 and rising to 23.2% in 2007. There are similar estimates made by other Indian and international agencies. A parallel shadow economy corrodes and eats into the vitals of the country’s economy. It generates inflation which adversely affects the poor and the middle classes more than others. It deprives Government of its legitimate revenues which could have been otherwise used for welfare and development activities.

4.         In the last two years, the Government has taken a number of steps to curb the menace of black money in the economy including setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT); enacting a law regarding undisclosed foreign income and assets; amending the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and Mauritius and India and Cyprus; reaching an understanding with Switzerland for getting information on Bank accounts held by Indians with HSBC; encouraging the use of non-cash and digital payments; amending the Benami Transactions Act; and implementing the Income Declaration Scheme 2016. 

5.         In order to implement the above decisions of the Government and keeping in view the need to minimise inconvenience to the public, the following operational guidelines have been issued:-
 
(i)            Old High Denomination Bank Notes may be deposited by individuals/persons into their bank accounts and/or exchanged in bank branches or Issue Offices of RBI till the close of business hours on 30th December, 2016.

(ii)          Old High Denomination Bank Notes of aggregate value of Rs.4,000/- only or below held by a person can be exchanged by him/her at any bank branch or Issue Office of Reserve Bank of India for any denomination of bank notes having legal tender character, provided a Requisition Slip as per format to be specified by RBI is presented with proof of identity and along with the Old High Denomination Bank Notes. Similar facilities will also be made available in Post Offices.

(iii)        The limit of Rs.4,000/- for exchanging Old High Denomination Bank Notes at bank branches or at issue offices of Reserve Bank of India will be reviewed after 15 days and appropriate notification issued, as may be necessary.

However, in accounts where compliance with extant Know Your Customer (KYC) norms is not complete, a maximum value of Rs.50,000/- of Old High Denomination Bank Notes can be deposited.

(v)          The equivalent value of the Old High Denomination Bank Notes tendered can be credited to an account maintained by the tenderer at any bank in accordance with standard banking procedure and on production of valid proof of Identity.

(vi)        The equivalent value of the Old High Denomination Bank Notes tendered can be credited to a third party account, provided specific authorisation therefor accorded by the said account holder is presented to the bank, following standard banking procedure and on production of valid proof of Identity of the person actually tendering.

(vii)      Cash withdrawal from a bank account, over the counter will be restricted to Rs.10,000/- subject to an overall limit of Rs. 20,000/- in a week for the first fortnight, i.e., until the end of business hours on November 24, 2016.

(x)          For those who are unable to exchange their Old High Denomination Bank Notes or deposit the same in their bank accounts on or before December 30, 2016, an opportunity will be given to them to do so at specified offices of the RBI on later dates along with necessary documentation as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of India.

**7th Pay Commission**

If entrepreneurship is where ambitions get fulfilled, a 9-to-5 bureaucratic government desk job is where ambitions get killed. A government job is an excellent way to start your career, if what you want is to also end your career in a government job because once you’re in there, you really need to screw up big time to be thrown out. How big? You could even skip work for 24 years before being fired like [this](https://www.rt.com/news/221543-india-government-employee-fired/) guy. Along with the literally fire-proof long-term job security, there’s also the chance of making a little buck from time to time with bribes - although few will admit it. But the jobs do come with the downside of being low paid. And the government is working to change that. Every ten years since independence, the government appoints a “pay commission” that recommends what to change in the salaries of over 1 crore government employees and pensioners. The government recently accepted the recommendations of the 7th and the latest pay commission which include an average pay hike of about 24%. It [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/7th-pay-commission-salary-hike-govt-salary-hike-arun-jaitley-2886723/) spending an additional ₹1 lakh crore (that’s 1 followed by 12 zeros) annually to accommodate increased salaries and pensions. Some of the money will presumably go right back into government coffers through taxes. But a range of other issues have stuck out as thorns and lakhs of government employees have threatened to go on strike if they remain unresolved.

**The Banks Need A Stress Ball**

It's been a long, long time since the RBI’s crusade against bad loans in the banking system started. But it doesn’t show any signs of stopping in the near future as the situation has only deteriorated. And if things continue going downhill, banks like the Bank of Maharashtra will probably have to switch slogans from ‘One Family One Bank’ to ‘One Bank One Bankruptcy’. The most recent round of stress tests at the RBI indicate that the banks are in desperate need of a vacation to de-stress for a little bit. The central bank [warned](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/stability-of-banks-has-worsened-significantly/article8784540.ece) that stability in the banking system has significantly worsened since mid-2010s. There is no use praying for the speedy recovery of our banking system as even the RBI did not exactly sound optimistic. At minimum, the central bank expects the amount of bad loans to rise from 7.6% this year to 8.5% next year. And at maximum, that figure can reach 9.3%. Profitability at the banks is in the dumps, having gone [down](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/takeaways-from-rbis-stress-test-banks-very-close-to-tipping-point/articleshow/52967108.cms) by 43% due to write-offs. Looking back at this mess, you can’t help but wonder what will happen if the banking crisis hits a tipping point, if the Punjab National Bank goes from ‘The Name You Can Bank Upon’ to ‘The Name That Just Went Bankrupt’.

**One Giant Leap for ISRO**

Every time ISRO makes news with a launch, you get that occasional story in your social feed that you like without reading and feel proud for about an hour, space exploration replaces Salman Khan on the list of things people care about, #ISRO trends on twitter, NRIs get that occasional feeling of guilt over contributing to brain drain and Shahrukh Khan is relevant because Swades. Well, here’s the story that you might’ve already seen and liked without reading: last week, ISRO made news in the global space commerce industry by [launching](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/isro-throws-satellite-making-open-to-private-sector-1423043) 20 satellites in one rocket. 17 of the 20 satellites were from foreign customers of Antrix, the commercial arm of ISRO.  It’s really anyone’s guess how much Antrix or ISRO charges for one satellite launch, but Antrix did report revenues of over ₹1,800 crore in 2015. But the launch wasn’t the only ISRO event making news. AS Kiran Kumar, chairman of ISRO invited the private sector to make a full spacecraft. So far, private companies like Larsen & Toubro or Godrej Aerospace have only manufactured the components that go into the making of a satellite.

**Time To Go Public**

India has two stock exchanges that really matter - the NSE and the BSE. So if those two companies wish to go public and list on the stock market, they’ve got two options to begin with. One, list shares on the rival stock exchange and risk being regulated by a competitor. Or two, list shares on it’s own stock exchange which is prohibited by regulations due to being the most obvious conflict of interest since the makers of sliced bread said it was the best thing ever. While the BSE is already in the process of listing shares and going public, the NSE [entered](http://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/nse-plans-to-file-ipo-document-by-jan-2017/article8779637.ece) the fray last week by announcing plans to go public as well. Interestingly, along with plans to list shares in India, the company also intends to list overseas by April of next year. It’s a fantastic time of the year to go public. Despite the naysayers of Brexit, recent IPOs have [received](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-ipos-idUSL4N19Q22K) a lot attention from investors and the IPO pipeline currently has big names like Vodafone, ICICI Prudential and L&T Infotech.

But the question is - can you trust the government to honour its end of the agreement? You just know that at the very least, your name is going to end up on some “special watchlist” at the Income Tax Department.

Tata Motors was given 1,110 acres for its Nano car plant in Sanand (near Ahmedabad) at Rs 900 per sq mt, Ford India paid at Rs 1,100 per sq mt for 460 acres close by, while India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, bought about 700 acres in Hansalpur at Rs 670 per sq mt.

The Adani Power Ltd. has claimed that it has paid customs duty on raw ¬materials and consumables – that is, coal imported for the generation of electricity. However, documents leaked to the EPW clearly indicate that the APL had not, in fact, paid the duty on raw materials and consumables amounting to approximately Rs 1,000 crore that had fallen due at the end of March 2015.

Ironically, the biggest black money case that has come up before the SIT so far is that of the Adani group. The Adani group allegedly took out over Rs 5,000 crore to tax havens, using inflated bills for the import of power equipment from South Korea and China, the SIT on black money was told by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The Adani group vehemently denies any wrongdoing. Modi, after his rhetoric-filled ride to power, has been silent. Since Modi’s ascension to office, what has happened in the ED, which had registered a preliminary case against Adani in Ahmedabad and was handed details of DRI findings, is illustrative. The officer heading the Ahmedabad branch of the directorate was raided by the CBI, which accused him of possessing disproportionate assets. It failed to prove anything at all, despite months of investigation. The two senior-most officers in the Mumbai regional office, who oversaw the investigations in Ahmedabad, were forced out of the agency. The tenure of Rajan S.

Bloodbath Continues On Stock Market; Sensex Falls 1200 Points - 11 Points You Need To Know,3,7vlecu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7vlecu/bloodbath_continues_on_stock_market_sensex_falls/,0,"> ""The Sensex and Nifty suffered a bloodbath today, tracking a selloff in global equity markets. Overnight, the Wall Street suffered its biggest intraday decline in history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with a loss of about 1,200 points - nearly 4.6 percent. Shares in other Asian markets were also under strong selling pressure, with Japan's Nikkei down about 5 percent. The Sensex fell as much over 1,200 points to 33,482 while Nifty tumbled below 10,300. The rupee also fell to 64.38 against US dollar, as compared to Monday's close of 64.06.""


* The trigger for the latest global selloff is Friday's job data in US, which showed American wages increasing at the fastest pace since 2009. This has raised alarm about higher inflation and with it potentially higher interest rates.

* In anticipation of the faster-than-expected rate hike from the Federal Reserve - the US central bank, bond yields have spiked in the US, undermining the attraction of equities. Higher bond yields are also seen as negative for emerging markets and commodity prices.

*  Though Finance minister Mr. Arun Jaitley Killed Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency but showed their interest in Blockchain technology, people still likely to [understand all in & Out of Cryptocurrency](https://www.eduonix.com/complete-steemit-course-earn-cryptocurrency-for-free?coupon_code=edu15) as well as interested to purchase it 

* The US central bank had last month kept interest rate unchanged but said inflation would likely rise this year, raising the possibility faster-than-expected rate hikes.

* On the other hand, [global oil prices have dropped](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/business-30691883/why-are-global-oil-prices-falling) amid recent dollar strength, with international benchmark Brent futures hitting a one-month low of $66.90 per barrel earlier this week. A fall in global oil prices is seen as positive for India as the country imports bulk of its requirement.

* Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday attributed the downslide in the local bourses to selloff in global markets. ""It is not due to the Budget or the LTCG (long-term capital gains tax),"" he said.

* Apart from the global selloff, the domestic sentiment has been hit by the Budget announcement of 10 percent tax on long-term capital gains accrued from equity investments, say, analysts. The Sensex fell over 800 points on Friday and over 300 points on Monday.

* The Street would also be closely watching [Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy stance](https://www.ndtv.com/business/rbi-seen-taking-tough-stance-on-inflation-in-monetary-policy-review-1808713) tomorrow. It is expected that RBI could turn more hawkish on inflation after inflation hit a 17-month high in December, well above its 4 percent target.

>  ""We expect the RBI to remain on a pause in this policy. However, the tone will likely be more hawkish with the probability of rate hikes in FY2019 increasing,""

* The selloff in Indian markets was broad-based with all the stocks in the Nifty50 index trading in the red. Among the big losers, Tata Motors slumped over 7 percent while Axis Bank and Indiabulls Housing Finance plunged nearly 5 percent each.

Want to shift to India - Finance or Programming?,6,5sed6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5sed6s/want_to_shift_to_india_finance_or_programming/,14,"I am a 22 year old NRI living in Thailand. I have zero corporate work experience. I have only worked in the family business with my dad. I am a BBA in Finance undergrad. I want to shift to Mumbai. Recently I got introduced to web development, and am really interested in learning it. However, I am interested in Finance too. So, just like webdev, are there online Finance courses I can take to stay updated in Finance, which will make it more likely for me to get a job? Or are there particular programming languages I can take up which will be beneficial in the Finance field? I have lost touch with Finance since I graduated in Dec 2015. Thank you.",nosleepnomore," Whats wrong with Thailand?  Follow your passion even if it means ditching something you've started. From what I have seen so far, algo trading is quite the rage and it marries both programming with finance. As a Javascript dev I would recommend you to master JS. 
You said web development and at this moment plenty of top companies like paypal, netflix, airbnb, fb and what not have all moved a chunk of their apps to js. Be it NodeJS/React native/Frontend JS is a big thing at this moment and years to come. 
Javascript has become what Java wanted to become.  Finance and programming can be a killer combination. Look up computational finance. High stress job, but the amount of money you will be making is insane. I don't know much about those lines of  work, but from personal experience the first you are going to notice is a bit of a culture shock. You would find it quite suffocating, atleast initially.

Can criticism of any social evil such as the gau-rakshak lynchings be termed as ""anti-India""? Can promotion of any currently widely unaccepted opinions like LGBT rights be termed as ""anti-India"" because a majority of people (and maybe even those in power) do not like them?

[RANT] Reality v/s Perception about the state of affairs in Bengal (economically).,13,3rvcoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3rvcoi/rant_reality_vs_perception_about_the_state_of/,73,"The trend right now is to continuously harp on certain shortcomings and create an environment of negativity about Bengal. And it's shocking how the ones who leave Bengal are busy bad-mouthing the state the most. That actually causes a very negative perception about it.

Contrary to the prevalent perception, the Bengal govt has done a significant amount of work in the last 4 years. Lets talk about them first.

->Growth:

i) Gross Value Added- India is growing at 7.5 percent while West Bengal is growing at 10.48 percent 

ii) Agriculture- India is growing at 1.1 percent, West Bengal is growing at 6.46 percent 

iii) Industries - India 5.6 percent, West Bengal 8.34 percent 

iv) Services- India 10.9 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent

v) Per Capita Income - India 6.1 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent.

These are as per statistics of the Central Statistical Organisation.

-> Investment Proposals:

i) Since TMC came to office, Rs 84,923 crore of investments are either completed or in process.

ii) In the Bengal Global Business Summit, Rs 2,43,000 crore of investment proposals are tabled and work has already started on the Rs 91000 crore within the last five months. 

iii) Changi airport has come to West Bengal creating the first ever with BAPL private sector greenfield airport in India, nobody talks about that. What is interesting is 1800 acres around the airport - 56 percent of which will have to be non-polluting industry is going to come up there, transforming that entire area as an Aerotropolis. 

iv) SAIL is already implementing on a promised Rs 16000 crore investment in the state and has now promised another Rs 40000 crore of investment. 

v) Anil Ambani's group is investing in cement. 

vi) Tata Metaliks has asked for expansion of its plant. 

vii) NTPC is coming up with two more power plants,work has already started on those. 

viii) TCS is almost ready with a new campus bringing in 20000 new jobs. Cognizant and Wipro have announced 5000 and 2400 new jobs respectively. 

ix) Wipro has started work on the construction of a new campus already. 

x) The largest Software Technology Park of India (STPI) is coming up in Kolkata for a Rs 100 crore investment. 

xi) Caparro Group has committed to investing in a small car manufacturing hub in Bengal,land has already been bought.

xii) Bengal Birbhum Coalfields, the newly formed company in which Bengal has the largest share, could well be a game changer for the industry-starved state.The company will develop Deocha Pachami, the country's largest mineable coal block, which happens to be in West Bengal's Birbhum district. 

xiii)Chinese bus manufacturing company Zhongtong has decided to set up an assembling unit at the airport city in Burdwan's Andal. The company has proposed to invest Rs 250 crore in the first phase and scale it up to Rs 1,500 crore. Zhongtong plans to manufacture buses in Andal later. 

xiv) Mahindra & Mahindra is investing 150 crores in Kharagpur.

->Finance Hub

Setting up a greenfield Finance Hub is a real tough thing. BKC took 3 decades to get built. Bangalore tried this. It failed. GIFT Tried this. In spite of ""Brand Gujarat"" and PR skills of Modi, it has failed to attract as many investors as New Town Finance Hub attracted. Getting 19 national level Financial Institutions commit investment by buying land at 13 crore / acre in a time span of 4 years is just AMAZING boss..
Is the Media ever coming up with these news? Even if they are coming up, they are portraying these things in negative light telling how many plots are yet to be sold.

->Tourism:

i) We know what traffic Darjeeling was receiving before TMC came. If you want check the pre-2011 statistics of Bagdogra Airport. Annual traffic was around 2-3 Lakhs. Last year (2015 March) it reached the mark of 1 million air passengers / year. in 2011, Bimal Gurung and his gang was creating trouble almost every other day through Bandhs and stuffs like that. Do we hear of those things now? That was MB's diplomacy and political shrewdness .

ii) Jangalmahal: It was a Naxalite den. Today we have several tourism initiatives happening there , tourists are visiting those places in good numbers. Bengalis love to roam around. They are getting new places to visit in WB itself. Tourism industry ( hotels and cottages) does not require much land and generates a lot of blue-collar employment in the form of drivers, stewards, cooks, guides,etc.

That's what a good administration was supposed to deliver.

->Financial Improvement

i) In 2010-11 (March 2011), debt-GDP ratio was 40%. In March 2015, it was 33%. 

ii) WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2011: 21,000 crore WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2015: 41,000 crore 

iii) Capital investment in state budget ( investment in creation of physical assets i.e. Roads, Bridges, irrigation canals,etc) increased by more than 500% in 4 years.

Does media ever report these incidents?

iv)Revenue Doubling happened at a time when oil prices crashed and state govt's tax collection on petrol and diesel got severely impacted.

Don't you think these show better administrative skills?

->Kanyashree Programme and Fair Price Medicine Shops

Similar models are getting implemented across many states at all-India level now. We know the good points of these schemes.This is a unique example where United Nations is now saying 53 developing countries who met in London must adopt the Kanyashree program.

->Revival of State PSUs

i)Only three states have discoms that are profitable (without subsidies) - West Bengal, Goa and Maharastra - according to the Planning Commission. 

ii) Transport PSUs were sucking up hundreds of crores of subsidy every year. Daily earnings of CSTC in 2011: 20 lakhs Daily earnings of CSTC in 2015: 30 lakhs

Now almost all the transport PSUs are profitable.

iii) Loss making Tantuja and Manjusha is profitable now. So is the newly launched Biswa Bangla Brand. It's not just about profit of these PSUs. More Profitable these companies are, more weavers, craftsmen, handloom workers can benefit from these platforms by getting more orders and earning more money. More direct as well as indirect employment is generated. Also , these profits form ""non-tax revenue"" of state budget, which helps in more capital investment.

Again, is the Media ever highlighting these things?

->FAILURES

The major failure has been in generating white collar jobs ( Both in IT and Manufacturing). And this happened because they did not market ""Brand Bengal"" well. Not giving SEZ Permission was perhaps the most stupid decision ever.

But Media is continuously highlighting these stuffs only. In 5 years, there has been only 2 Foreign Trips by MB and Media is complaining. On the Contrary, MB and her bureaucrats should have made several trips to Silicon Valley and should have tried to incentivize more Hi-Tech Companies to establish R&D Centres in Kolkata.

->BOTTOMLINE:

Every State has its own problems.

Do people in Bangalore always complain about broken roads? Do people in Gujarat always complain why GIFT could never become a success in almost 9 years or why Ahmedabad could never become a big IT Hub?

No....Boss....No
",deepayan99," > i) Gross Value Added- India is growing at 7.5 percent while West Bengal is growing at 10.48 percent

That is wrong, you compared India's real growth with West Bengal's nominal growth. India's nominal growth is 11-12%...

http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/budget-2015-india-nominal-gdp-growth-seen-at-11-12201516_1316686.html

> v) Per Capita Income - India 6.1 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent.

Again wrong figures lol, given that West Bengal's growth as you claimed was 10.48, how can per capita grow faster, unless West Bengal's population decreased...

Also since I have no idea how you got your figures from...


http://statisticstimes.com/economy/gdp-growth-of-indian-states.php

As you can see West Bengal is below all India average in growth...

India's growth in current prices was 15.04%, whereas West Bengal was 14.53... from 2005-2014

Now I don't really know whether to trust the rest of the numbers you provided... We all know what Mamata B did to the railways while she was the rail minister. Doesn't matter what she does for Bengal. She fucked up the entire country once already. Excellent writeup, thanks for this. If you could, edit in some sources if possible.

Stereotypes and negative perceptions are very slow to change. The CPM under Jyoti Basu has been in power for around 30 years, and there is a high chance people visited the state in that era. Which is why you still see the recurring belief that there's bandhs every day.

>The major failure has been in generating white collar jobs ( Both in IT and Manufacturing). And this happened because they did not market ""Brand Bengal"" well.

People are inherently often selfish and care about themselves primarily. The online Indian community cares much more about this sort of growth, rather than an overall increase in living standards, rural infrastructure/healthcare/education or per capita earnings.

Unfortunately people are too busy spreading FUD about West Bengal, like the [Durga Pujo ban](http://scroll.in/article/766597/ground-report-was-durga-pujo-really-banned-in-a-west-bengal-village) and trying to paint Mamata as some sort of caliphate sponsor. Or saying absolutely ridiculous things like Kolkata is being overrun with Bangladeshis thanks to Mamata. Bengali media is extremely anti-TMC (many of them are now sympathetic towards the CPM which is absurd), and the far-right media is too for obvious reasons.

Of course it's never a bed of roses when it comes to Bengal and there are a lot of problems too which definitely need to be highlighted. Mamata is often a bit too hot-headed and authoritarian, and would do well to listen to her advisors and be more measured when talking to the media. Actually this is something she has improved on.
And there's still the worry that since a lot of CPM cadres moved over to the TMC, they brought with them the same thuggish goonda politics:

http://www.firstpost.com/politics/west-bengal-poll-violence-why-this-trend-wont-stop-965611.html

Corruption is also a big problem in the TMC, and the sharada scam investigation got completely scuttled. Of course problems like this exist in most states that are at a similar stage of development, and one of the good things about bengal is communal and caste conflict and polarization is substantially lower. Are you member of tmc? I don't about other people but I know in my area and town; things have developed a lot and is peaceful. Would vote for TMC actually. Look at the condition of national highways - fucked up.

Look at the condition of Trains - extremely overcrowded and even the AC chair cars are dirty.

Look at the condition of Job market - pathetic.  Even though there are vacancies the government is unwilling to fill them up.

Look at the condition of Taxis in Kolkata - not metered and shabby and are waiting to loot you.

Roads are blocked because of protests/bandhs.  I have seen politicians rallying on the national highways.

Mamata's nephew + Tapas Pal. Enough said.

Rampant fighting between student political parties in colleges.

Minority appeasement/vote-banking politics.

Saradha scam.
 excellent write up, OP. 

I think that things will change for the better, but its going to take a long time. Without that negativity being believed by the general public, a certain opposition cannot make an entry into the state politics. Mamta, you sexy fox! Please be our next PM. #Mamta4PM. Hey, thanks for the detailed post. Appreciate the effort.

This sub is heavily biased towards national politics. I recommend making posts about regional news more frequently. I'm sure good work is happening in many places and we don't know about it, like this case with Bengal.",Business/Finance,2015-11-07 16:41:45

###Headline Stories

**Food (Wastage, Inflation)**

Shin Chan used to separate out *shimla mirch* from his meals and throw them in the trash because he didn’t like them. And also because he didn’t understand the economics of food wastage and inflation in modern India. A review by Economic Times last week [reported](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/food-wastage-can-cost-a-family-rs-80-lakh/articleshow/53127874.cms) that if the average family reduces food wastage by half and invested the savings at 10% returns, it can add up to ₹21 lakh in 30 years. However, that is not a static number since food prices tend to rise with inflation. And the inflation numbers for June [back](http://www.firstpost.com/business/cpi-inflation-at-5-77-should-ring-alarm-bells-for-new-rbi-governor-2890602.html) that claim. Food inflation was at 7.79% in June, up from 7.47% in May. Specifically, inflation in vegetables was about 14% in June, up from about 10% in May. So the next time your mother tells you to eat your vegetables, just pinch your nose and eat those godforsaken things that masquerade around as food. While that number only looks at food prices, consumer inflation which looks at prices in general stayed pretty much the same at 5.77%. Far from being a reason to pop open the champagne, “pretty much the same” still means a 22-month high. That 5.77% number should ring alarm bells for the RBI because if it crosses 6%, the RBI is required to explain to the government why it failed at keeping inflation in check. 

  

**The Business Of Cricket**

Baba Karl Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. But in India, you could easily replace religion with cricket in that sentence and it would still stand true. With cows being the only thing more sacred that cricket in India, all that religious obsession over cricket has made gods out of cricketers. And cricketers have raked in the money as they’ve turned themselves into a brand. Just a short list of businesses that Virat Kohli owns partly or entirely includes a chain of fitness centers, a clothing line, a tennis team, a football team, a wrestling team and a sport-based social network. And he’s adding one more to that list. Mr. Kohli is now a co-owner of his own [fanclub](http://yourstory.com/2016/05/virat-kohli-fanbox-privyplex/) called ‘Virat FanBox’ that sells a branded edition of Moto G smartphone that comes preloaded with his app that gives users exclusive access to him. With a price tag of ₹16,999, Virat FanBox also gets you a signed miniature cricket bat and one-year subscription to his fanclub. And of course, it has to come in a box, otherwise the name wouldn’t make sense. Time for a confession - that was news in May, not last week. Last Week In Indian Economy, bringing you week-old, and sometimes even months-old stale and smelly news since 2016. More recently though, last week Dhoni’s apparel and footwear brand Seven [marked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/dhonis-brand-seven-grosses-over-2-5-million-in-three-months/articleshow/53221126.cms) a milestone of $2.5 million in sales just three months after launching. 

  

**Gotta Catch ‘Em All!**

It started with Angry Birds. Then came Flappy Bird. And now we don’t exactly have another bird, but we have Pokemon Go. The augmented reality mobile gaming app has instantly catapulted to so much popularity that it is now bigger than Tinder and Twitter. The internet managed to give it the hug of death as well. With more than 15 million (official) [downloads](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pokemon-nintendo-business-implications-augmented-000000901.html) from 26 countries, the mobile game had to stop new players from signing up because the traffic had pushed its servers over the edge. Perhaps more noteworthy is the fact that it has managed to do the impossible. It’s managed to bring out hordes of nerds from underground basements to open-air gardens and parks, many of whom are just finding out that they are allergic to sunlight. It’s also managed to bring the stock of Nintendo up by 106% in the past two weeks. Nintendo owns 32% of The Pokemon Company, which is reportedly [making](http://www.wsj.com/articles/pokemon-chasing-investors-send-nintendo-shares-soaring-1468228206) an estimated $1.6 million per day in revenues from the game. For Nintendo, this couldn’t have come at a better time - the company’s profits fell by 61% last year due to weak sales of its console Wii U.

  

**Let The Games Begin! Again.**

The earnings season is here again. Which means newspapers don’t have to worry about filling empty space anymore. This earnings season was kicked off by three high profile names - Infosys, TCS and Reliance. As oil prices recover in the global market, petrochemical major Reliance [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/ril-q1-beats-estimates-profit4-grm-surges-to-361150bbl_7047161.html) a 4.4% increase in net profits beating expectations. The company’s currently busy preparing for a commercial launch of Reliance Jio, it’s foray into the telecom business. Moving over to names in the IT industry that reported earnings - When Donald Trump rants about foreigners stealing American jobs, this is part of what he’s unknowingly referring to. Both IT companies, TCS and Infosys are in the business of helping multinational corporations outsource their work and business is booming. But only for one of them. TCS [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tcs-q1-results-idINKCN0ZU15T) a better-than-expected 11% rise in net profit but dalal street had no love for the stock which remained flat. Perhaps due to fears over Brexit since the UK contributes 15% to the company’s revenue while the rest of Europe adds another 12%. On the other hand, while Infosys did post a 13% rise in profits, but it [lowered](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/infosys-posts-lacklustre-q1-result-slashes-outlook-2917009/) its predictions of the profit it might report throughout the rest of the year. Definitely no love for the stock which is down over 8%.

* Former RBI Governor D. Subbarao’s memoir called “Who moved my interest rate?” hit the stands last week. In the tell-all book that may cause some embarrassment to prominent leaders in the government, Subbarao [gives](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/d-subbaraos-memoirs-manmohan-singh-ignored-finance-minister-on-subbarao-term/article8850380.ece) all the dirty details of his stressful relationships with then finance ministers P. Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee. Since this book comes 3 years after his term as Governor ended, all we have to do now is wait 3 years for Raghuram Rajan (or “R3” as the social media calls him) to write a book revealing the real reason behind his resignation. Mark your calendars for 2019. 
  

* Recent research reports [indicate](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/earn/which-it-jobs-will-survive-automation-find-out/articleshow/53127553.cms) that Indian IT and Services industry is scheduled to lose about 6.4 lakh low-skilled jobs to automation over the next five years. Ugh, not another robots are taking over our jobs story. Although all the jobs at risk are at the bottom of the pyramid, this is alarming since the $160 billion IT industry is one of India’s biggest employers. We already have an R3, won’t be long before we get an R2-D2 as well. 
  

* Air India is certainly not a private sector airliner. But a lot of bureaucrats treat Air India like their own private airliner. Part of that is because they’re mandated by law to travel by Air India. That might be changing soon. In a potential policy change, bureaucrats may be [allowed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-may-lose-privilege-of-being-sole-carrier-of-government-staff-if-cabinet-note-goes-through/articleshow/53144940.cms) to choose the airline that offers the lowest fare rather than having to travel on Air India. So, Air India may lose the privilege of being sole carrier of government babus. Although, was it really a privilege before this? 
  
* You know how the bad guys in every movie always carry black suitcases full of cash to a drug deal? How much cash do you reckon is inside those suitcases?

Great job as always! You missed Gold BOND ? Why  Can someone please tell me the logic behind the 'eat the stuff on your plate, many children go to bed hungry' statement ?

Consider this. I cooked **V** amount of something. Took the whole **V** amount, but just ate **0.8V** of it, threw away **0.2V**, that is wasted. This can't in any way go to a hungry child anywhere. 

**But** if I take what I can eat, i.e. **0.8V** and leave **0.2V** for the next day, then I would cook less the next day, that would mean I save something on food, someone else can buy what I didn't waste.

But the problem is that the poor can't afford to buy what I didn't waste because it wouldn't reach them. There are many, many middlemen involved in the process who make sure that that rarely happens.

"Budget 2018: Cryptocurrency is not a legal tender, but government will keep exploring blockchain technology",2,7uije8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7uije8/budget_2018_cryptocurrency_is_not_a_legal_tender/,0,"The Narendra Modi government is looking to oust cryptocurrencies from India but has a lot of affection for blockchain. Keeping that in mind no wonder in future Blockchain technology will replace all mediatory authorities from financial transaction & Indians will start to [learn fundamental knowledge of Blockchain technology](https://www.eduonix.com/blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ethereum-essentials)

The distributed ledger technology is becoming a hot favorite in Asia’s third-largest economy for solidifying information, alerting all stakeholders, and preventing tampering. So much so that, in his budget speech on Feb. 01, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced plans to adopt blockchain technology.

> “The government will explore the use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in the digital economy,” 

Jaitley said.

Most commonly known as the technology underpinning the likes of bitcoin and Ether (of Ethereum-fame), blockchain is a digitized and decentralized public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Stripping away the financial application, blockchain is essentially a bookkeeping platform that can be accessed by anybody on the internet but is owned by nobody.

> “Once you have a blockchain, the big spreadsheet in the cloud serves as a record-keeping system that can’t be forged and can’t be reversed,” 

said Nicolas Cary, the co-founder, and president of [Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/) (the company, not the technology).

**Eager governments**

Blockchain technology is already making waves in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

The government there is working with Swedish startup ChromaWay to set up a blockchain-based land registry system that allows people to collateralize property, get loans, and invest against that asset. Tracking property ownership using blockchain allows people to circumvent disputes, frauds, and errors, while also lessening the administrative hassle of registrations and title transfers.

Beyond land registries, blockchain can also put an end to other fraud like identity theft. To reduce the chances of getting hacked, a growing concern in India, the web-based platform can manage digital IDs. 

>“Currently, if you sign up or pay for something on the internet, you turn over unencrypted personal info that gets stored all over internet…creating a honeypot that attracts attackers to breach that service,” 

Cary said. 

With blockchain, only encrypted, relevant information will be released whenever necessary.

Recently, the Maharashtra government called upon industry leaders, researchers, and others to devise ways of incorporating blockchain in e-governance operations. 

> “The government is one of the biggest data creators and data consumers. Blockchain will bring in more efficiency, transparency, accountability, and accessibility in data flows,” 

the state’s chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, said at the Maharashtra Technology Summit (MTech) on Jan. 17.

Amid all the talks of curbing cryptocurrencies, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, still believes that blockchain technology is ripe for adoption. Banks in India are already relying on blockchain to enable overseas transactions, international remittances, and other processes.

The spread of blockchain use in the private sector use of in industries like insurance, healthcare, manufacturing, among others, could also lessen significant burdens that befall the government.

> “Capitalising on the blockchain technology could open new ways of securing peer-to-peer lending transactions, boosting trade finance, fintech and information repository sectors,”

aid Sapan Gupta, the national practice head of banking and finance at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.

> “By segregating the use of blockchain from crypto-currencies reflects the government’s intention to use the technology in a gradual and safer manner before it gets into concepts like replacing currencies.”

**Positive side-effects**

Using blockchain to monitor supply chains means the journey of a good can be tracked from sourcing to their sale by collecting information in the secured cloud-based ledger.

For instance, in the food and retail industry, shipments can be tracked and digitally recorded via a blockchain in real time.

> “This can save lives in the event of an outbreak of food-borne illness,” 

Daniele Bianchi, an assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School, said. 

> “This is obviously helpful both for consumers and the government. Especially in emerging economies whereby the supply chain is typically not easy to track.”

Just like identity theft becomes harder, meddling with critical digital assets—like patient consent records in the healthcare sector or insurance payouts—also becomes less of a concern since no single authority can modify the records. At Bajaj Finserv, the holding company of Bajaj Group’s non-banking financial company (NBFC) and insurance firms, blockchain technology is being used to simplify travel insurance claims. If a flight is delayed, that information comes to the system and the claim amount is automatically generated and paid without the customer having to even file a claim.

There are currently over 40 Indian startups working on blockchain technologies in various industries like finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and logistics, according to Sangeeta Devni, a programme manager at the IT industry trade body NASSCOM’s 10,000 startups initiative. But real-world applications are still few.

**Still learning**

After interviewing early adopters, both on the customer side and vendor side, consultancy firm Deloitte recognised a slew of deterrents to using blockchain technology (pdf) that exist in the Indian market. From a lack of awareness to a dearth of trustworthy vendor partners to cybersecurity concerns, various challenges persist.

> “The main danger comes from hacking, that is, the innovation of the blockchain brings new type of attacks which are far less understood and much less mitigated as those occurring in conventional database management architectures,” 

Bianchi warned.

###Headline Stories

**Pip Pip, Guv’nah!**

It’s here, and it’s real. The referendum to decide Britain’s fate took place last week, and a lot of things have hit the fan since then. It’s time for the Brits to wake up and smell the tea. With a 52% share of the vote, the Brexit camp won, which means the UK will now [leave](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/17/11963668/brexit-uk-eu-explained) the EU. It won’t happen next week, or next month - they now need to go through a complex procedure that can potentially take about 2 years to complete before officially becoming EU-free. They need to negotiate the terms of the exit with the EU as well as sort out some internal affairs that had been managed by the EU until now. The EU which accounts for 1/4th of global economy is also India’s single largest export market. To ELI5 the effect this will have on India - previously, Indian companies had to satisfy only one rule in order to sell products everywhere in Europe. But now, they will have to satisfy one rule in order to sell products in the UK, and another rule in order to sell products everywhere else in Europe. Nevertheless, the headline news here is that most of UK just went, “Farewell, European Union!”. Or more accurately, as the Brits would say, “Cheerio, buggers!”. 



**You Get To Exit, And You Get To Exit, Everybody Gets to Exit**

There are exits and then there are exits. But it all started with the Rexit (Rajan exiting the RBI). Now coincidentally, we’ve got an exodus of people in business and economics leaving their positions. YC Deveshwar, who’s been for 20 years the head of ITC, the billion dollar cigarettes-to-hotels firm is [leaving](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/uhmto3w6LYTfdGcXfcdjLN/Deveshwar-to-lead-ITC-as-nonexecutive-chairman-after-term-e.html) next year. SK Roy, the head of LIC, the state-run insurance company that is the single biggest domestic investor in the markets today just [tendered](http://www.firstpost.com/business/lic-chairman-s-k-roy-another-upa-appointee-resigns-before-his-5-year-term-2851360.html) his resignation as well. Roy was appointed for a 5-year term under the Manmohan Singh government. His term still has 2 years remaining but he’s calling it quits now. Can you guess the name of someone else who was also appointed under the Singh government and who also recently surprised everyone by the news of his exit? Alright, alright.. I’m sorry, I’ll move on. And now for some international resignations. Nikesh Arora, celebrity investor and ex-Google exec who was being groomed to be the next CEO of SoftBank also [resigned](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-can-t-be-ceo-in-waiting-softbank-s-nikesh-arora-explains-sudden-resignation-2226223) after they told him that founder and current CEO, Masayoshi wanted to be CEO for 5-10 more years. Kids these days, I tell you, so impatient. 48-year-old Nikesh Arora is currently busy coming to terms with the fact that he just left behind a pay package of $73 million a year.

**A ménage à trois**

A merger is when two or more companies come together to become one. Usually, mergers that are in the news refer to just two companies coming together. The *or more* part is rarely invoked. But this time, we have a rare case of merger with HDFC Life, Max Life Insurance and Max Financial Services [going](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/MJ5YsT8RS330FJhTDYJJZM/Boards-of-HDFC-Standard-Life-Max-Financial-to-meet-to-discu.html) for a threesome of mergers. Here’s how it’ll work: Max Life Insurance, the fourth-largest private insurer, will merge with parent company, Max Financial Services which will then merge with HDFC Life, the third-largest private insurer. Together, they will combine to become India’s largest private insurer. Every merger has a story behind it, albeit not always an exciting one, it’s still business and not Dan Brown. But our story begins 13.8 billion years ago with the big bang. We had some dinosaurs. Then some other stuff happened. And then in the late 1990s, India allowed private insurance companies to compete in the market which was dominated by the state-run Life Insurance Corporation. It should’ve spelled bad news for LIC but it still emerged as the winner in the competition as even today, the insurance industry is dominated by LIC. It’s no joke to compete against LIC which sells insurance policies that are basically guaranteed by the government. So you need to join forces and make allies if you want to take on the ring-leader that is LIC. And this three-way merger is only an effort to join forces and make allies.

**Funding For A Fund Of Funds That Funds Startups**

A significant part of this series always ends up being about the government even though it is supposed to be about the economy. Well, that’s because a significant part of our economy is controlled by the government through state-owned corporations and legislative policies. But the government’s influence on the economy is gradually declining because of policies like disinvestment, where the government gradually privatizes state-owned corporations. But sometimes, you just have to invest to spur growth. The government [approved](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/establishment-of-fund-of-funds-for-funding-support-to-start-ups-116062200723_1.html) a ₹10,000 crore fund that will be managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India, who will use the money to invest in funds that invest in startups. With this, the government isn’t trying to encourage the creation of Indian Zuckerbergs and Gates’ - it’s trying to encourage the creation of Indian jobs (with the lowercase j). More specifically, the fund is expected to create 18 lakh jobs. 18 lakh jobs? That’s enough to feed 18 lakh poor families. Either that, or about 18 #Urbanpoors.

* The Food Corporation of India is the government-owned company that runs and manages the public distribution system, or what you might know as the ration shops that sell food at cheap prices. It’s the FCI that pays the extra 10 bucks while buying, so that the farmer doesn’t get exploited by having to sell for cheap. Except instead of mangoes, it’s food-grains. The government provides a lot of subsidies through the corporation - so many subsidies that the FCI now owes ₹58,650 crore to others as pending subsidy payments. Which is why it is [inviting](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/fci-to-raise-rs-20000-crore-short-term-loan/articleshow/52885209.cms) bids from banks to raise a short term loan of ₹20,000 crore. Oh yeah, because when you’re a government-owned corporation, you don’t go to the banks when you need a loan. The banks come to you.

You'll learn a lot in your 2 yrs of MBA, about the world, about ppl around u, and most importantly yourself. Unlike most academia, there is no single minded focus on academics. There is a lot of interaction with people and testing of your soft skills. If you go in with the intention to make big bucks, it will be futile.

Do it, only if you have the money and get into a reputed institution.

Is Modi making Corruption systemic? (I [r]eally want to know),7,7c849u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7c849u/is_modi_making_corruption_systemic_i_really_want/,1,"So apparently the previous thread is being downvoted, as the OP says, without a debate. I see that he hasn't stated his position or made his arguments at any point, just stated his opinions. Can a clash of opinions just be called a debate or a discussion?

I, for one, genuinely want to know if this is true. And if yes, how? Let's try to keep our political biases aside, it concerns our country and our lives. 

Regarding the Supreme Court, the OP refers to [the SC thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7c0mjv/an_institution_collapses_update_on_what_is/).

> Why does it matter?

> It implies that the Chief Justice can effectively stop any allegations of corruption against itself by refusing to let anyone else hear the matter. This is very significant for corruption, and also in light of the fact that **the current government is trying hard through the NJAC to take control of who becomes a Supreme Court judge.**

Last I checked, this happened - [SC Bench strikes down NJAC Act as ‘unconstitutional and void’](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-verdict-on-njac-and-collegium-system/article7769266.ece) and there haven't been any developments since. There have been secular and apolitical cases for NJAC before by reputed scholars in publications like thehindu, Indian Express etc.

> RBI after demonetisation

>> For argument’s sake, even if we accept that the demonetisation was not in the best interest of the Indian economy, could Patel have prevented this? Section 26(2) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, says that on recommendation of RBI’s central board, the government may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that with effect from a date specified in the notification, any series of banknotes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender. And, Section 7 of the Act says, “The central government may from time to time give such directions to the Bank as it may, after consultation with the Governor of the Bank, consider necessary in the public interest.” So, the government’s advice to RBI on demonetisation is in accordance with the Act, which also permits the government to supersede the central bank if it believes RBI has failed to carry out its obligations.

It has always been this way, we had a media friendly governor but RBI has only had a semblance of independence and the govt has not tried to force any rate cuts, which still speaks volumes. The governor is still allowed to criticize policies (like waivers) and is doing his job on NPAs. I strictly urge people not to let out their disappointment of Rajan not getting a second term on the institution and current governor.

I think this is a genuine concern and the developments off late haven't been desirable, this really should be discussed more and the media will never discuss it. Media being generally politically owned/biased. 

>  The Finance bill which give political parties access to benaami funding.

I do not really know much about this so I'd rather not opine and let someone with more knowledge of the bill rather than cursory read of articles explain in detail how it makes things worse than they are.

> He is making the 0.001% at the top above law, almost god-like. This includes the business tycoons, senior most officials in the government, Ministers

This reads more like political statement without any subtantiation, and the response to it will be more based on personal perception of whoever is discussing. And as psychology tells us, our genuine perception can be the way we want it to be, based on our biases. Our minds work to confirm our worldview, not refute it.

What I know is that this country has always had that culture, in fact, most collectivist cultures do. Indian economy has always had heavy influence of the incumbent traditional business-houses. The public policy has always worked in a way to retain the incumbents rather than provide competition.

> senior most officials in the government, Ministers

And I suppose this is referring to the ordinance proposed by the Raje govt in Rajasthan? The senior BJP leadership stated they don't support it and afaik, even indicated that they'd take action against Raje were she to move forward with this. There were [voices against this in BJP](https://www.oneindia.com/india/not-only-opposition-some-bjp-leaders-also-against-rajasthan-govt-s-draconian-ordinance-2567599.html) itself and they've responded to the feedback.

What motivated me to post this? I'm a regular citizen who goes about his life in a distinctively apolitical fashion. I've enjoyed countless discussions here on this forum but I've sort of become apathetic, and I don't see the doom out in real life.

What are my genuine gripes with the Modi government? The big-brother like approach and linking everything to Aadhaar in the name of ""anti-black money"" movement, creating a surveillance state. The ""Project Insight"" (cue Avengers reference) of stalking people by the taxman, will it really be only for tax purposes? I doubt it. 

I acknowledge there are genuine concerns about the policies adopted by the current government and I want to know more about them, have a constructive discussion. I'd be more than happy to be proven wrong with proper sources and arguments. Afterall, it's impossible for a person to know every aspect of everything.

WTF is Demonetisation - Part II,13,5fpo2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5fpo2v/wtf_is_demonetisation_part_ii/,11,"What is Participatory Note?
Participatory notes are not mere instruments used by Pakistan to invest in our economy. Modi says he goes to a lot of foreign countries  to bring in Foreign Investment.

Out of such Foreign Investments, the highest a country has invested is not US or the UK or France or Germany or any other major country but a tiny island called Mauritius. 

A small Island off Indian Ocean whose total population would be about 12 L! Mauritius has invested more than 40% in India. 

Many other such islands like Cayman islands etc exist. How did such islands get such huge money to invest in India and who exactly are those people? Whose money is it anyways? 

That money is none other than the illegal stash of the Indian crony capitalists! The money starts from India and goes on a sight seeing trip across many countries and finally gets to Mauritius - which then finds its way back to India as Foreign Investment!

If the illegal money that is in circulation in India is Jeevatma, the illegal money circulating around the globe is Paramatma - in the language the BJP folk can understand!

Jeevatma becomes one with the Paramatma, this indian sewer water gets mixed with International sewer waters, then when it comes back to India again via Mauritius, it is the Pure Virgin Ganges water or Foreign Investment - Modi will do snanam and worship it and welcome it with folded hands!

The very same black money that they say they are trying to eradicate, has come back as Foreign Investment, and it gets lots of subsidies when it comes back to India!

So who's taking it away to Foreign countries? How do they take it?Let's for a moment forget TATA, Birla, Ambani, Adani etc, among the fat cats there are individual fat cats like our ministers - yes Ministers! Many of these Ministers who do not even have a  standard education have property in foreign countries, coal, iron ore factories abroad and even whole islands in their names! Some of it has come out in the newspapers too!

People like Adani sell solar electricity to states and these ministers make a huge cut out of it. But do they get bribes in a sack and then carry it abroad? No, they just show a benami name and a property will be bought in that name or money transferred in his HSBC bank! So next this minister or that benami comes back as Foreign Investor!

Many of our ministers go on trips to such islands like Cayman Islands - does Modi not know of this? Will Modi ask all of his ministers to submit their travel itinerary for the period they have been in power for audit? 

Let's take an example: The Central Board of Excise and Customs, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence has given a report - 'a scam involving companies inflating the value of coal imports from Indonesia for their power plants thus siphoning money abroad. Initial estimates by the agency pegged the overvaluation at Rs 29,000 crore in the period 2011-2014.'

How did this scam happen? If we had purchased directly from Indonesia, a tonne of coal cost $50. However, it was handed over to other brokers and middlemen aka crony capitalists to purchase it. Coal is still in Indonesia - but it changes hands to 7-8 different countries on paper alone! So when it comes back to India it costs $87! 

So multiply 37 * 70 for a tonne. It involves states Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Kerala! Each state has lost about 1500 Cr due to this scam.

The culprits include state parties and its minister in this along with Adani, Ambani, Ruia, Jindal, India cements etc. Adani has gained 6000 Cr illegally by supplying industrial parts for Gujarat State Electricity Ltd according to Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.

Modi travelled all over India during his election campaign using Adani's Jet. Its behind Adani's money that  Modi was able to fund his political campaign!

He travelled with same Adani to Australia to get him permission for mining rights. Just this Nov 18, Adani was given 6000 cr loan for the same Australia mining project!

Can Directorate of Revenue Intelligence ask why coal sold at $50 was sold at $87 - even if they ask they'll say it is business practice - Standard Operating Procedure! Its perfectly legal and cannot be questioned in court too!

All those companies that changed hands in the process just exist in letter pads! Benami Companies! So DRI cannot do anything about this illegal money and all these companies have understanding with the countries where they are stored - so they wont ask and even if they ask it will fizzle out!

So when the govt itself is supporting this washing of Black Money to White through such routes, where does the question of catching the Black Money arise?

Atleast here coal was bought and 29000 cr lost, but there are examples where such operations have taken place in paper alone!

There is another such Island Bahamas whose population is 3.5L only. In 2008, export from India is $ 22,00,000. In 2010 it grew to $ 280,00,000. What do you think that this 3.5 Lakh people bought from India? What was being exported from India? Two companies have done it - Reliance & Essar - petroleum has been exported. Even if the 3.5 Lakh people drive around 24*7 and eat drink and shit petrol, they can't possibly use such a huge amount of petrol as was being exported! So there you go!

This was not just carried out by Ambani's but by Reddy brothers - who swallowed the Bellari, who were powerful to move the state border of karnataka into Andhra! Such efficient people - Sushma Swaraj's disciples! They have exported very high quality iron ore - how much? From the ports the reports says 5000 shiploads have been exported. But Excise has reports only 4000 shiploads. What happened to the remaining 1000 shiploads? Where is the revenue from it? Where has it been invested?

Doesn't Modi know all this?

So Black Money is not something in a hidden box which you can go and collect it and bring it back and deposit Rs. 15,00,000 in everyone's account.  Its about handling black money practices - as we've seen above they've devised ways to make such black money laudering routes and practices as legal. This incidentally has happened more during BJP rule. No its not a biased statement.

According to World Bank report during the period 1998 - 2004, it was during the vajpayee rule that such black money practices and black money has flourished to the maximum extent in India. Now you can understand why the news came in today about BJP leading the parties in income from unknown sources. 

In 2011, after scams such as 2G etc started surfacing, Advani started a Rath Yathra against Corruption and Black Money, saying there are 70 Lakh Crores of Black Money stashed abroad, I'll bring it back"". Advani was held up as the iron Man - Lauh Purush - as if he'll act like a superman bomb all illegal stashes abroad and bring all black money back but he was bombed by Modi in 2014 who took over his role and got involved with Anna Hazare etc and personally making gullible statements to fool people about 15 L for each account.

However, during UPA rule, in a very important case for Black money, the tax evasion case by Vodafone, the SC ruled that we cannot demand such tax from them. After that, when Pranab Mukherjee brought in rules to avoid such malpractices namely, GAAR - General Anti Avoidance Rules, the person who spoke vociferously against it and did not allow it was none other than our present FM Arun Jaitlee! Not just FM but all the corporates and crony capitalists were against bringing in this rule!

During UPA rule, the BJP asked Congress to bring out names of Swiss Bank holders in Parliament. Pranab Mukherjee ridiculed them in Parliament. Swiss Banks are not giving out names, shall we send the Army? BJP kept quiet and then turned it as if Congress is not giving out names. Today, when BJP is in power, Modi is giving the same answer to SC!

Now, BJP is not keen about money stashed abroad. So they turned their attention towards internal black money (Jeevatma, remember?) So doesn't Modi know who are the kingpins involved? Ok if you don't know who can find it out - Income Tax, Enforcement directorate, Revenue Intelligence, CBI, Finance Ministry are at his disposal! So what are those departments doing?

Either they are in the payrolls of such kingpins or you all have decided not to act on them. So this whole system is nothing but a farce!

So now Modi is trying to bring Black Money out of ordinary people - who have never seen such huge amount of money as quoted in this post - let alone black money! Modi has brought in an emergency situation and panicked the people. Just before this demonetisation, Modi met and discussed with 3 chiefs of Army Navy & Airforce. Why? Because, he feared a civil unrest and wanted to avoid it. This Army has not been sent against the kingpins of black money but if the ordinary people are put to much hardships they know it will lead to outcry and want to avoid it and have taken measures for that.

After doing all this, the BJP representatives when asked if by removing 500 & 1000 notes will BM be curbed, on talk shows they are saying ""We never said anything like that. This is a step towards curbing black money.""

So why such a drastic measure has been thrust on the common man? There's a reason for their activity. Its not about Black Money or Fake Money but totally irrelevant to it!

About Mauritius - Most of the investments come through FPI / FDI route. You need to be registered with SEBI for an FPI registration. Details of ultimate beneficial owner needs to be submitted for making investments. Shares are held with custodians (Indian registered banks) and regularly KYC needs to be updated.


On the point why investment come through Mauritius - because capital gains are exempt under the India Mauritius Tax treaty. But that has been amended now and from April 2017, capital gains will be taxable. It was nothing but a favourable tax jurisdiction. It is known.

Here's why India shouldn't adopt the Nordic welfare model,35,2gg76m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2gg76m/heres_why_india_shouldnt_adopt_the_nordic_welfare/,105,"DECONSTRUCTION OF THE NORDIC MODEL

Most problems that India face now can be attributed to consequences of Nehruvian socialism that this country has adopted for about 45 years. I am from Kerala and here the Politics cannot be separated from communism and despite being an age old relic, it still refuses to die out.

Since the reforms that was carried out in 1991 most millennial Indians have largely rejected such archaic concepts focusing more on modernity. But in this context a new concept has largely caught the fancy of most new age Indians: The Nordic model. As such in my experience I see more people supporting Nordic model over communism currently in Kerala. 

In this slightly lengthy post, I will try to deconstruct the Nordic model from two angles.

1. Nordic viability in India
2. Efficacy of Nordic model

First a note on Nordic model. Nordic model or Nordic capitalism or Nordic social democracy refers to the economic and social models of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), which involves the combination of a free market economy with a welfare state. More or less implemented around the mid 60s, this is said to have promoted a sustainable state and economy in these countries. Calls have been made among policy makers in India, with special mention to Nobel prize winning welfare economist Amartya Sen, to implement reforms along the Nordic lines in India

NORDIC VIABILITY IN INDIA

Nordic Socialism: Indian proponents of Nordic model advocate establishing a state along the social democracy lines. But the truth is that Scandinavia isn't really all that socialist. Scandinavian countries have certain socialist characteristics such as high taxes and extensive welfare systems. However, these countries have relatively capitalistic markets. Scandinavian businesses are mostly free from regulation, nationalization and protectionism. Sweden, Denmark and Finland rank higher than US in in business freedom, monetary freedom, investment freedom, fiscal freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. Norway ranks higher than the US in trade freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. 

Source: http://www.heritage.org/index/explore

The overall point here is that Scandinavian countries have fairly capitalistic business environments. Until India, which has abysmal rankings in all these parameters, achieve free business environment and comparable income levels it should not consider a comparable welfare model.

 Economic calculation problem: First proposed by Ludwig von Mises, it describes the signalling function of prices. Prices of goods are signals to entrepreneurs to adequately allocate their resources. When economic planning is added to the mix, it distorts the market forces and prices. This in turn facilitates inefficient allocation of resources and wastage. In a macro scale this presents itself as inflation. Larger the economy, harder it becomes to ""plan"". Scandinavian nations are all small economies with homogeneous economic components and it would be relatively easier to centralize function there (But it has not been without its demerits, more on that below). India is one of the largest and the most diverse economy in the world in terms of the economic components involved. As such India is last candidate for any sort of planning. History has shown that most planning here has met with some sort of counterproductive unintended consequence and the inflation numbers here speaks for itself.

Bureaucracy and social trust: Scandinavian countries are characterized by high levels of social liberalism and trust. Research finds that high levels of social trust increase economic growth. According to one study, ""The size of the effect in most studies is such that 10 percentage points higher trust is associated with half a percentage point higher annual growth rate. In the Scandinavian countries, about 60 percent agree that most people can be trusted, which can be compared to the OECD average of about just 40 percent.

Source: http://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Govt-Size-and-Growth.pdf

There is also the case of the highly transparent nature of the bureaucracy in the Scandinavian nations. As with the trust worthy nature of the bureaucrats there, they can be trusted with governing functions of the state. Bureaucracy is India on the other hand is an absolute mess. India features almost at the bottom of the transparency index. As evidenced by the corruption, Bureaucrats here simply cannot be trusted with any action and would be best left free of bureaucratic control.

Source: http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2013/results/#myAnchor1

Taxation problem: Scandinavian nations are characterized by high levels of taxation on income. Although I will go into the problems of Nordic model below, it must be said that these countries grow in spite of high taxes, not because of them. Indeed, several studies which examine taxation across developed countries show that when other determinants of growth are accounted for, taxation seriously diminishes growth. At the same time it must be added that while these countries have high tax on incomes, the corporate levels are low. Corporate tax average of Scandinavian nations is about 25% compared to about 40% in USA. So it is possible that the corporate sector there is balancing the economy. Hence higher tax levels are not an option in India where industry and corporate sectors constitute only a marginal share of the overall economy.

Sources: http://ideas.repec.org/p/hhs/ratioi/0130.html
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1699715

Economic history of Nordic nations: Most Scandianavian nations instituted the Nordic model in mid 1960s. Before this most of these countries reaped benefit from high growth facilitated by laissez faire policies and neutrality in the World Wars. Welfare system that you see now wouldn't have been possible had it not been for the surplus it had made during their laissez faire era. India on the other hand has no Laissez faire history. It is a country which is home to half of the world's poor. By instituting a welfare state, India would be incentivizing these poor souls to continue in their misery.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/9YhKdaE.png

Norway : Norway is an exception among Nordic nations itself. Oil was discovered in the North Sea in 1960 after which the country made its switch to welfare state. When liberals in US point to the per-capita GDP of Norway, they forget to mention that much of this is a result of big oil interests. Norway is the largest oil producer and exporter in all of Western Europe. Norway produces roughly 200 barrels of oil per person per year. That puts it at number 5 in the world for per capita oil production. In other words, Norway is successful despite its government, not because of its government. India is largely import dependent when it comes to oil and has very few proven oil reserves. It cannot bank on resource wealth to fund its welfare state.

EFFICACY OF THE NORDIC MODEL

In this portion, I will discuss the problems with Nordic model itself. Given below are series of comparisons he made between Scandinavian nations and USA under various parameters. While US itself is no paragon of capitalism. Over the years it has show relatively high levels of free markets which has slightly regressed in the recent years. The main difference between the American system and the Nordic Model is that America has a medium-size welfare state and the Nordic nations have large welfare states. That explains, at least in part, why the U.S. economy generally outperforms the Nordic Model. US stats were easily available online, so I took that. Give me a beak.

As seen in Figure below US has enjoyed a faster rate of growth.According to the OECD, the U.S. grew by an average of 3 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 3.3 percent between 1992 and 2006 (meaning average growth of 3.2 percent for 1981 to 2006). The Nordic nations, by contrast, grew by an average of 2.2 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 2.7 percent from 1992 to 2006(meaning average growth of 2.5 percent over the entire period). The IMF, meanwhile, reports that U.S. growth averaged 3.1 percent from 1981–2006 compared to an average of 2.6 percent for Nordic nations in the same period.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gpTtjiA.png

Figure below, measures of per capita GDP from the World Bank, the OECD, the IMF, and the CIA all show that Americans haveabout $6,000 of additional economic output per person, significantly more than $20,000 for each family of four.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/ilG5UVr.png

Although per capita GDP is an excellent measure of overall economic output relative to population, it does not necessarily measure living standards. Comparing U.S. and Nordic living standards requires numbers for disposable income. The OECD series for disposable income in the Figure below. According to a study using 2003 data, the average person in the US had more than $27,000 of disposable income, while the average person in Nordic nations Had disposable income of barely $14,300, less than 53 percentof the U.S. level. Even Norwegians, bolstered by oil wealth, had per capita disposable income of less than $16,800, barely 62 percent of the American level. Danes and Finns are at the bottom, with less than 50 percent of the disposable income of the average American. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/anuxd8j.png

Personal consumption: In 2005, the Danish Finance Ministry produced numbers comparing per capita private consumption in OECD nations. As seen in Figure below, the average person in Nordic nations has barely 51 percent as much private consumption as an average American. The Norwegians are the most prosperous, but even their private consumption is just 56 percent of U.S. levels. Both the Swedes and the Finns have less than 50 percent of the private consumption of average Americans. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/jIIqdoc.png

As expected by the nature of free markets Nordic countries lag US when it comes to per capita GDP growth

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gjBFuGG.png

Last but not least, defenders of the Nordic Model argue that the US suffers from greater levels of income inequality. Various measures of inequality, such as Gini coefficients, confirm that “wealthy” Americans earn a bigger share of the pie than Upperincome citizens in Nordic nations. But this data is incomplete without also looking at the size of the pie. As illustrated in Figure below, the poorest 10 percent of Americans have about the same level of income as the poorest 10 percent of Finns, Swedes, and Danes. Only in oil-rich Norway is there a noticeable gap (data for Iceland not available). What differentiates America from the Nordic nations is the income of everyone else. The rich, the middle class, and the working class in the US enjoy higher levels of income than their Nordic counterparts. If nations are being judged on the prosperity of their poorest citizens, then Nordic nations certainly are equal to the US. Indeed, they even have a slight advantage (though even that advantage might disappear if Nordic nations had US levels of immigration). But if nations are being judged on factors beyond just the well-being on the poorest segment of the population, then the US holds a clear edge.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/lDeXvnX.png

CONCLUSION

Excessive government diminishes growth. And although the Nordic countries’ relatively free markets mitigate the damage caused by high taxes and high spending, the burden of government is hindering economic performance. The Nordic Model is preferable to the Continental or Corporatist Model of nations such as France and Germany, which combines welfare state policies and interventionism. When I was researching this , Google news showed that Sweden plans to scale back it welfare state due to pressure. 

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/swedish-elections-cracks-showing-nordic-model

These AAP Kejriwal types are constantly backing a welfare state. I am not against AP or anything, if they can just fix their economic policies, I'll be all for them. Milton Friedman famously said that you cannot have a Welfare state and open borders. Sweden seems to learning that lesson. In India's case Free markets is the best option.

What do you think ?",rafaellvandervaart," Norway has oil money, we don't The real reason is that population of all these Nordic countries is most of the time less than that of mohallas like Doddanekundi, Malviya Nagar and Adyar Regarding your inequality argument:

* The per capita income of USA and Nordic countries are around the same. (Except Norway, due to oil money it becomes much higher).
* You have stated that bottom 10% are at the same level.
* And that ""The rich, the middle class, and the working class in the US enjoy higher levels of income than their Nordic counterparts.""
* Then who exactly gets less income?
* If all sections of the population are at same or higher level then how is the per capita GDP same?

Something's gotta give... India is a huge country with lot's of people in it. Whatever works in other countries will not work in India as a whole.  Regarding income inequality again, let us put the per capita gdp data aside which - [imf](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/01/weodata/index.aspx) and [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD) - say that USA is behind Norway, Denmark and Sweden and ahead of Finland. Leave Norway out since it is much higher.

For this discussion, consider that incomes are almost the same.

Now, consider the share of income appropriated by the richest 10%:

* Denmark	26%
* Finland	31%
* Sweden	28%
* USA	46%

Further, consider the share of income appropriated by the richest 1%:


* Denmark	6%
* Finland	8%
* Sweden	7%
* USA	18%

[Source](http://topincomes.g-mond.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/#Database:)

One could argue how much this really matters, but based on the data, there is a huge difference in income inequality between USA and Nordic countries. Free market is a good idea for capital formation and uplifting poverty on a large scale but there will be still some people left out. A moderate welfare system to prevent the most marginalized from being wiped out. I agree on capitalism and free market being the main drivers but it should be regulated a bit. USA s golden age was in the 70s where free market was regulated.

Are u totally against welfare system,even the minimum for marginalized people? Another crucial thing which india needs to do is shift subsidy to investment in education and health . Nordic countries and west beats us at this.This is the most important issue which needs to be handled .our GDP share of education and health is not even 5%. One thing you'll never see a capitalist country do is cross-subsidise. Take the example of Canada. Canadians near the border pop into the US to buy goods for cheap. Canadians away from the border have a harder time. Overall Canada has overpriced goods compared to the US. This is because the government taxes these goods with a purpose to cross-subsidise. It is easier to create infrastructure near the border, and reaching further from the border needs higher investment for lesser returns (as the population density is lower)

You yourself said that India is not homogenous. This means that central planning is more essential. These are the people who look at the statistics and know how to apply remedial measures to balance things out so that people are not penalised for being different from the others. 

Another example of the failure of cross-subsidies is how the airplane industry in the industry concentrated along certain hubs, and discontinued routes. America has so many closed airports and runways and deregulated airplane industry has basically stuck to just servicing the profitable routes.

Should a city dweller pay taxes for the person living in the village? Obviously. How else are you going to provide equitable facilities across the country. How much ever you dream for capitalistic free markets, the free markets are leeches that only stick to profits. Just because the principles of  central planning are perverted by bureaucrats co-opting industrialists leading to terrible implementation, it doesn't deny and extinguish the need for cross-subsidy.  

How many monopolies do you have in that place called Keral? Keral runs it treasury through all kinds of sin taxes. 
And the free market in Keral is not without its own graveyards. Who is your most famous free-market litterateur in Keral? Keral is a really ugly place, and all the development plans it put out are so shameful- it has the worst kind of consumeristic society - so much that it supports a huge amount of trade in the nearby states. That Montek comment on Keral people not having to grow rice. Madhav Gadgil would cry.

Communism can never explain the complete failure of Keral. It had several bad aspects too without doubt. Even in nearby Sri Lanka communism failed spectacularly. I don't think it is a communist that destroyed Keral's rivers and forests. Tell me a free-market person in Keral who will restore Keral's rivers and forests? Many communities depended on those and they paid their taxes too.

You haven't been charmed by a socialist, good for you! Bad for others.
There are many respectable Keral people who are not free-marketters and they do a lot of good and provide many undervalued services.  We can't afford an extensive welfare program like the Nordics because we don't have the money for it. Like others here have said, they have oil reserves and a much lower population. They also benefited from the industrial revolution (which we mostly missed) and have been wealthy for a very long time.

Other than that, this seems like an *incredibly* biased narrative of economic models and your comparison of USA and Nordics is very far off the mark. GDP-PPP per capita isn't the only measure of wealth or living standard, and neither does it address whether one system ""works"" or not.

Without some kind of assistance to the poor and marginalized they will just die. This is not ""populist"", and neither is it something that anyone in Indian politics will ever imagine doing. 

I'm not sure why you keep saying ""nordic model isn't socialism/communism"" - everyone knows that.

You mention that ""crony capitalism"" is *only* caused by big government. Cronyism can happen both in governments and in corporations. Corporations need to be regulated or they will often end up cartelizing whilst exploiting both their own customers and their employees. 

I thought the whole ""free market will fix everything"" chant died out after 2008, and now it's restricted to ancap and lolbertarian camps.

>These AAP Kejriwal types are constantly backing a welfare state. 

Who gives a shit about AAP ?

>Milton Friedman famously said that you cannot have a Welfare state and open borders. Sweden seems to learning that lesson

Please elaborate. Let me guess ""muslims are ruining sweden"" and ""dirty immigrants"" right ?

 [deleted] Average Indian IQ: 84
Average Nordic IQ: 100
-----------------
Population density of India: 380.04 ppkm2 (33rd in the world)
Nordic population: Sweden has the highest with 21.5 ppkm2 (194th in the world)
-----------------
India: non-homogeneous population forming a sizeable population (with multiple races)
Nordic: one ethnicity
-----------------
As you see from the above statistics, we are wildly different from the Nords. Trust is due to the one ethnic component of a society. A lack of trust is due to our society being very divided, where it is caste, sect, religion or race. Excellent points. Just another thing I want to add are cultural mores which contribute in large part to the Nordic model. Can't exactly go in depth since I am at work, but the concept of not trying to stand out too much or show off personal successes is a central idea which predates their modern socialist policies. 

http://pinetribe.com/janteloven-root-scandinavian-modesty/

Indian culture unfortunately is exactly the opposite. Being on top of the social hierarchy is the Indian dream. comical , itna padha , but didn't applied any logic , Bhai , India doesn't have the resources to apply Nordic welfare model.

Our welfare programmes are mostly for poorest of poor and the marginalised . We can't limit ourselves to categories of ""socialism"" , ""capitalism"" , ""free-market"" , we should do everything which removes absolute poverty and 8-9% growth comes under that economic paradigm.

I hope you get the economic growth is means to end , HDI improvement should be the end.

  India is not Norway, Sweden or Denmark. Hence no Nordic model. Problem solved. Instead of comparing India to the Nordic states or Botswana, the only real comparision is possible with China. China has shown how powerful a state directed, capitalistic, welfare economy can be.

In 1960, Chinese per capita income (adjusted to current $'s) was $ 99. India's was $ 108.

In 2012, Chinese per capita income was $ 6,700, Indian per capita was $ 1,500. Chinese per capita income has increased by 67, Indian per capita by a mere 13. The improvements in HDI has also been breathtaking. Within a span of 35 odd years after liberalisation China with the largest pop in the world has gone from a poor country to middle income country.

A country like India needs a huge dose of Keynesian economics to propel growth. We need a trillion dollars of investment in infrastructure, and this does not include investment in the social sectors. The private sector does not have the capital nor the interest in funding these areas.

India has the highest number of poor people in the world, 350 MILLION. These have no access to electricity, water, sanitation, education, transport and these would be at the bottom end of Maslow's pyramid, as you scale up these poor people won't even be aware of stuff like the internet or housing.

Every single major economy in the world today has gotten to where it is after a long period of Keynesian economics (America, Germany, Japan , China, even Britain during the labour era after WW2). Laizzez faire and the idea of a perfectly functioning market is as utopian as a perfect communist state. Statist intervention (via high taxes) in areas such as education, infrastructure, power, sanitation, roads, ports etc are needed to enable a capitalistic state.

You have written a lot, but haven't said what do you mean by free markets? Do you mean no regulation? No state funded welfare programs? What is your definition of a free market? Kudos well argued. Some of the better efforts I've seen.

Do note that the model we are most likely to follow and what I believe has been set in motion is the Korean model.

And from what I see about sen, his comments are best understood when he expand on the details. The headlines don't do him any fair treatment. can be much more easily summarized by :

We can't afford it.

We are too big, diverse and populous to sensibly compare with Nordic regions (also starting from much lower base)

We need to find our own way to education, wealth and health

The fastest path to wealth is open markets and low regulation.",Business/Finance,2014-09-15 19:12:34

I haven't been performing well in my academics (I have had backlogs.) I got inclined towards finance in my first sem itself (have done coursera courses and regularly read) and have been trying to accentuate it since then. I have had some experience since my first year which is as follows,

- Have had experience as a business development intern in my first sem and also as a summer equity research analyst at a startup.
- Devised and organized an event related to securities and trading during the techno-management fest of my college.
- I'm the vice-president of business at the Google Students Club 
- I handle the finances and the sponsorships at a solar race car team. Have been responsible for major sponsorships that the team has had.
- I'm a campus ambassador for Uber as well.

The interview is at a VC firm which also focuses on renewable energy. So what are some questions I should be prepared for?

Finally received an offer from a VC firm in Bangalore. Had applied to 54 firms. ",lohapurush," Make sure you know the firms portfolio - find out what they invested in, what stage they invest in.

See if you can find any interviews of the founders, in the off chance you find out what sort of investments analysis they prefer.

Checked VCCcircle for them yet? 

What do you know about the renewables market in india today? What are the broad numbers for the industry?

You generally show focus so it's a good interview position, show that you are willing to learn and work it out.

If you really must, check out Wall Street oasis - it should have some America centric VC interview ideas. (This is where the founder pedigree/history will help you.)

Last Week in Parliament (July 18 to July 22),50,4uhxod,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4uhxod/last_week_in_parliament_july_18_to_july_22/,8,"Hello /r/India,

I return with another four weeks of fun and frolic at the expense of our elected leaders in Parliament!

Last week, a shiny new cabinet was sworn in, a spirited discussion on Kashmir crisis (and TN Fishermen and Bangladeshi infiltrators) happened, an unknown rule was invoked unknowingly and shot down promptly and many legislations were passed.
Let’s get right into it!

___
#Shiny new Cabinet sworn in
___

Apart from the [53 new members](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/partymemberlist.aspx) that were sworn into Rajya Sabha, PM Modi introduced his new ministers to both houses. Prakash Javadekar replaced Smriti Irani as Minister of Human Resource Development, Vijay Goyal was given Ministry of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs & Sports and Anil Madhav Dave was sworn in as the new Minister of State (Independent charge) of Environment forest and Climate Change. A whole host of new Ministers of State were also sworn in. 

I know what you’re thinking.
 
*What’s the difference between a Cabinet Minister, Minister of State (Independent Charge) and Minister of State?* 

**Cabinet Minister**: Person is given full control over a Ministry and is eligible to attend cabinet meetings (which is the highest decision-making body of the country).

**Minister of State (Independent Charge)**: Person is given charge over a ministry, but the PMO keeps a close watch on how the ministry is functioning. These ministers are allowed to attend cabinet meetings only if the PM’s permits them to do so.

**Minister of State**: Person is given charge of a specific department or just a part of a Ministry, especially when the Ministry is large (Eg: Home, Defence or Finance). The Cabinet Minister has complete authority to decide what tasks are to be given to the MoS within the Ministry. MoS cannot attend cabinet meetings.

Casual Observation: Out of all those who were sworn in, Arjun Ram Meghwal seemed to have gotten the loudest thumps and cheers. He used to be the Chief Whip of BJP in Lok Sabha and has now been made MoS of Finance. 
Seems like he won’t be able to [bicycle to Parliament anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxyz8YASYHk).

Bonus: Here’s the [mother of all government directories](http://goidirectory.nic.in/union_categories.php?ct=E002), in case you want to find out how to reach ministries. This includes state ministries and PSUs as well. Explore away!

#Kashmir Crisis… Bangladeshi Infiltration and Tamil Fishermen
___
Discussions were held in both houses of Parliament regarding the ongoing agitation happening in the Kashmir Valley. While accusations flew thick between the Congress and BJP, regional parties like AIADMK and TMC decided to bring in their own international border issues into the discussion.

Kalyan Banerjee from TMC started speaking about infiltration from Bangladesh to West Bengal when he was interrupted by Ananth Kumar, Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers. He pointed out the Mr Banerjee was going off topic. 

[Then this happened](http://imgur.com/lWsluww)

You're killin it Khargeji!

AIADMK’s A Anwar Raajhaa (With the kind blessings of [Puruchithalaiva Amma](http://mythicalindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/weird_jayalalitha_fans.jpg)) spoke about Kashmir and then switched to talk about the problem of fishermen in Tamil Nadu who are being harassed by the Sri Lankan Navy. Raanjhaa demanded that this should be declared as a national issue as well.

___
#Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha Adjourns
___
The Parliament was summoned on July 18 for the monsoon session and the news was splattered with headlines like “Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha adjourns”. 

Everyone was like, “What?! Why do these politicians keep disrupting the house? Why don’t these people want to work?” 

Well, they do, but they couldn’t help it this time round.

The adjournment wasn’t because of disruptions, which is usually the cause, but for paying respects to a sitting member of Parliament who passed away. Mr Dalpat Singh Parasate of Shahdol constituency in Madhya Pradesh passed away on June 1 (#RIP). 

It’s a followed practice that in case of the death of a sitting member, Parliament will not transact any business on the first day of sitting as a mark of respect. In case an MP dies while the Parliament is in session, the house is adjourned for the following day. In the Budget session, Mr PA Sangma passed away and a similar adjournment followed. His son Conrad Sangma now occupies his seat of Tura (Meghalaya). 

The first order of business for this session in Lok Sabha was [his swearing in](http://imgur.com/vgFFwdH).

Interestingly enough, Rajya Sabha has decided in May 2016 to [curtail this practice](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-not-to-adjourn-for-day-if-sitting-member-dies-in-intersession-period/article8672837.ece) if the Member of Parliament passes in the interim period. The upper house will now only adjourn if an MP dies during sessions. Lok Sabha sticks to its ol’ ways. 

___
#Thou Shalt not read out Speeches
___

While giving his speech on the Kashmir crisis, A Anwar Raajhaa of the AIADMK happened to just read it out from a few sheets of paper. He even mixed up the sheets in the middle and went off course a few times. 

Rao Indrajit Singh, MoS of Urban Development, took strong offence and got up to object. He asked the chair to stop him because there is a rule against reading out speeches in the Parliament. Well, he goofed up a little though. The person in the chair was Deputy Speaker Dr M Thambidurai. He’s from the AIADMK.

Thambidurai seemed visibly upset that the chair was being questioned and asked Singh to sit down. Although a lot of the conversation was not put on record, witnesses of LSTV will vouch about the use of the word “he’s speaking nonsense” being thrown around rather loudly. At one point, Mr Singh seemed to have given out the impression to the Deputy Speaker that he was being partial towards his own party member. The otherwise calm and gentle Thambidurai seemed to be visibly upset. 

The funny thing is that this is actually a rule. Rule 352 of the [Procedure and Conduct of Business](http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rules.html) says: 

> “A member while speaking shall not…. (xi) read a written speech except with the previous permission of the Chair.” 

So in this case, there was no clarity whether or not the prior permission of the chair was taken. If only Mr Rao Indrajit Singh quoted the rule number, he might have been able to achieve his objective. 

Mods, pliss to tweet the correct rule to him?

#A few other interesting rules (for teh lulz)

(iii) shall bow to the Chair while entering or leaving the House, and also when taking or leaving his seat

Personally, I find this unacceptable. The parliament functions for the people and it should continue functioning beyond who lives or dies. One can have a couple of minutes to mark respect but adjournment of parliament is just loss of time and completely disrespectful to the people of India. [deleted] Thanks again man. This was brilliant work OP! Take an upvote !! When will MPs stop shouting and start discussing? On Friday treasury bench disturbed Rajya sabha on the issue of Panjab's AAP's Mann.

Since so many people called me out for making up shit I will simply quote from articles this time.


Creation of money by the banks

> The Credit Market Funnel

> Suppose the U.S. Treasury prints up $10 billion in new bills, and the Federal Reserve credits an additional $90 billion in readily liquefiable accounts. At first, it might seem like the economy just received a monetary influx of $100 billion, but that is actually only a very small percentage of the actual money creation.
> 
> This is because of the role of banks and other lending institutions that receive new money. Nearly all of that extra $100 billion enters banking reserves. Banks don't just sit on all of that money, even though the Fed now pays them 0.25% interest to just park the money with the Fed Bank. Most of it is loaned out to governments, businesses and private individuals.
> 
> The credit markets have become a funnel for money distribution. **However, in a fractional reserve banking system, new loans actually create even more new money. With a legally required reserve ratio of 10%, the new $100 billion in bank reserves could potentially result in a nominal monetary increase of $1 trillion.**

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081415/understanding-how-federal-reserve-creates-money.asp

India uses the same system overall but the multiplier is higher.


> Every one rupee of central bank money in India is able to generate around 6 rupees of money supply in the economy. India’s ratio remains lower than that of Europe, but higher than that of the US.

**NPAs in India**

> Public sector banks (PSBs), which accounted for 90 percent of the total gross NPAs of the banking sector, has seen their gross NPAs jumping past Rs 7 lakh crore in June 2017 quarter. In the past seven quarters, it jumped by Rs 4.18 lakh crore or 133 percent to Rs 7.33 lakh crore in June 2017 quarter from Rs 3.14 lakh crore in September 2015 quarter.

> Public Sector Banks' Gross Non-Performing Assets Hit 9.83%. In FY16
> Gross NPAs of private sector banks were Rs. 48,380 crore, meaning just 2.70 per cent of gross advances of Rs. 17,91,681 crore during the fiscal 2015-16.

> For example, in the steel sector, Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel have an exposure of close to Rs 1 lakh crore. Other large stressed companies - Jaypee, Lanco, Videocon, and GMR jointly owe over Rs 3 lakh crore to the banking system. Most of them got into non-core activities like real estate which guzzled up the borrowings, resulting in losses and defaults to banks.

> State Bank of India topped the list of banks with wilful defaulters with Rs 15,069 crore stuck in 997 accounts of borrowers, recording a rise of Rs 2,759 crore in fiscal 2017. Punjab National Bank was second with wilful defaults of Rs 10,989 crore in 871 accounts. Bank of Baroda’s wilful defaults soared from Rs 1,367 crore in the year ended March 2016 to Rs 4,785 crore by March 2017.

> Recently, finance minister Arun Jaitley candidly admitted that the bad loan problem was largely confined to some 50 large corporate groups who had indiscriminately borrowed from banks to set up steel and infrastructure projects, especially in the power sector. **These groups alone would account for over 80% of the total NPAs and stressed assets in the banking system.** Latest data shows that the total NPAs and stressed assets are in the range of Rs 13 lakh crore to Rs 14 lakh crore. **And these are politically, well connected corporate families who dominate election funding.**

Somewhat of an opinion piece but read out of it what you want.


Based on all the quotes above I want to ask a few questions, why did the government still decide to recapitalize using public money? Why isn't divestment of SBI and PSU banks on the table? 

Doesn't pumping more public money mean doing the same mistake all over again? All the NPAs were given to political friends of Congress around 2009 or so. 

Now without substantial changes big loans will be given to political friends of BJP and it is very likely that the loans will become NPAs some 10 years or so from now.",IndianLiberal," Recap isn't pretty and I believe we need substantial reform of Public Banking companies but without recap the Indian bank system would have have trouble meeting the Credit requirements in the short term.( I don't think any major bank would have failed but some smaller  could have  failed without recap.) 

         Disinvestment of trouble banks would not fix the issue in the short term(don't forget the unions) and probably lead to panic and maybe an actual systemic crisis.
       
     The recap is need to ensure credit in the short term (5-10)   and disinvestment should be the goal in the next 10-15 years.",Business/Finance,2017-11-12 04:12:40

Demonetisation and Bike Service,13,5ipl9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ipl9r/demonetisation_and_bike_service/,5,"WARNING! THIS IS DRUNK RANTING. READ AT YOUR OWN PERIL.

It was a cold fucking day. I had to do something I had been putting off for quite some time -- get my bike serviced. I called up the closest service centers to ask if they accept payment by card and I learnt that the nearest service centre that accepts cards was 18 kilometres away. I had to do this nevertheless. As I had said, I had been putting this off forever and I cannot ride her without the service she needs.

So, rode her to that far off service centre and I reached by 13:00. The dude outside noted her number, made a job sheet, and handed out the customer copy to me. He told me that there's a mall nearbly in case I wanted to watch a movie, or I could just wait in the customer lounge. I decided to wait. There was a stupid Govinda movie on the TV -- he was double acting as a cop and his goofy twin. I sat through it. Boredom makes you appreciate the stupidest things. By the time the movie got over, I had checked to see if they had taken my bike in. They hadn't. I was getting impatient. I was getting hungry. I decided to look around for food. I found a place that sold Punjabi sandwiches, whatever the hell those were. I thought I'd pass. I walked further and I found a place cheap and crowded. It was *parathe zabardast parathe*. Crowded is nice. Crowded means you won't have diarrhoea the next morning. So, I walked in and I had a double egg paratha. I was filling as fuck and I paid him with the last 20 rupee note that I had on me.

I walked back to the service centre. They hadn't taken my bike in. That was disheartening. I decided to go and sit in the customer lounge. The aroma of the paratha that my nose had gotten used to made me realise how stinky this ""lounge"" was. It smelt of old unwashed clothes, dandruff, and grease. Anyway, I was sleepy and I dozed off.
I woke up an hour later. My bike hadn't been taken in. I talked to the manager. He said something about a queue. I grumbled and I went back to the customer lounge. I listened to music on my phone for an hour and it was 17:00. Two hours to close shop. A skinny dude finally takes my bike in. I was relieved.

The mechanic asked me if there are any problems. I told him what I had to say. He asked me where I was coming from. I told him.

""Bro, that's far away. Don't you know we have a service centre there?"" he asked.

""Yeah, but they don't accept payment by cards,"" I said.

""Oh, right.""

One of his colleagues walked by.

""Dude, the finance guy called,"" the colleague said. ""We have to wait for November's salary until January, or we have to accept in old notes.""

""I'm not taking old notes *bhencod*,"" he said. ""What if I fail to deposit into my bank account?""

""You've got a point. Yeah,"" said the colleague and he walked away.

""Your bike's sorted,"" the mechanic said. ""They'll clean it. You can make your payment by then.""

I proceeded towards the floor manager and I got my job card. I walked towards the billing counter.

That's when I saw it --  a helpdesk, a distraught girl behind it, and two cops in front of it.

""We hear that this place is accepting and transacting in old notes,"" the fat cop said.

""No, sir. The only old notes we have are from before 9 November 2016,"" the girl said.

""But, we got a call from here saying that your salaries are being disbursed in old notes. DON'T YOU DARE BULLSHIT ME!"" the fat cop bellowed.

The girl, evidently nervous, said, ""Sir, I don't know what you're talking about. We don't accept old notes anymore.""

""Who's phone number is this? We got the call from this number,"" he asked her showing an incoming call on his phone.

""Sir, this number is a common office contact,"" she said, ""Everybody uses it.""

""Okay, so that's how you're gonna play it. I want to see your cashier in two minutes,"" he said.

The cashier was behind his counter and I was having my billing done. I told him that I wanted to pay using my card.

""We're not accepting cards,"" the cashier said.

""Well, I don't have any cash. All I have is my cards,"" I told him.

""Give me five minutes,"" he told me. It looked like he was shitting his pants after the cop asked for the cashier. The cop was then standing beside me and staring intently into the cashier's face.

""Go on. Swipe his card,"" the cop said, ""I can wait for a couple of  minutes.""
 
The swiping machine was in the floor manager's room and the cashier took me along. After the swiping business was done, he said, ""Bro, I can't go back to my cabin and get your invoice. The cops are right there. I'll tell the floor manager to release your bike.""

""Cool, whatever,"" I said.

He talked to the floor manager about my bike. ""The cleaning isn't done yet,"" the floor manager said,""It's gonna take some time.""

I loitered around the shop floor and the customer lounge for some more time and my bike was finally clean. The cashier walked in and handed me my invoice.

""I had to get in there for other customers anyway. Thought I'd give you your invoice,"" he said.

""What happens now?"" I asked him out of curiosity.

""I don't know, bro. *Bhenchod*, these cops probably didn't even get a call from here. Maybe they just want a bribe. One shop a day for them I guess. That girl in reception in new. It's sad that she has to go through this,"" he said. ""Gotta go, man. They are quizzing our GM now, but I have to be there in case they need paperwork.""

""Thank you. Goodbye,"" I said.

""Goodbye,"" I said to the floor manager.

""We're used to shit like this,"" the floor manager said,"" Running a business isn't exactly easy in this shitty city. Goodbye and good night.""

And I came home on my serviced bike, under-dressed for the winter night, shivering in the cold, my hands cold as fuck, thinking of that poor receptionist and the cashier.

tl;dr Went to a service centre to get my bike serviced. Cops hassle them saying that they're transacting in old notes. They say that they're used to this kind of hassling by the cops.

p.s. I'm down quite a bit of Old Monk as I type this.

p.p.s. This shit ain't political. I just wanted to share something I've seen. I just wanted to share how big changes are a pain in the ass for businesses as well.

Why Modi supporters just don't get it the problem of corporate debt. NPA's. And the recent bailout of PSU banks.,23,3k2pic,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3k2pic/why_modi_supporters_just_dont_get_it_the_problem/,24,"I write this knowing that Modi supporters seriously lack understanding of the lending business,economics and business in general  and will probably make some half-assed excuse for the 75000 crore bailout but lets look at some figures.  But this needs to be said in light of todays FM meeting which will used to further bailout these idiots in corporate India who have used public money and in return just done what they have always done - misuse the capital. Not to mention are trying to force Rajan to cut interest rates to save their own ass despite savers siginficantly suffering in the last 3-4 years due to negative real interest reducing India's savings signifcantly and forcing people into risk assets like equities, (which are incidentally now down 13% from the top).

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS - Savings % gdp.

China's corporate debt to GDP is around 160% of GDP. 

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/chinas-corporate-debt-at-160-of-gdp-twice-us-level/articleshow/48141056.cms

India's corporate debt - taking into account private sector lending growth is around 53.8% . (Based on 2014 figures and credit growth).

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FS.AST.PRVT.GD.ZS

China has 3x the loan as a % of gdp. Yet has 4x lower NPA on its banks balance sheets. And despite that its banks are facing a debt crisis.  It too has implemented a lot of basel 3 norms which started around 2013 (an excuse used by Modi supporters to justify restructuring when in reality India already employs capital adequacy rations which basel 3 is has asked to be implemented by 2018 making the implementation irrelevant). Even if you take into account China's shadow banking industry its still much lower. 

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FB.AST.NPER.ZS/countries?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&sort=asc

The reason I mentioned China is because China's growth most of which has come in the last 15 years going from a 1.7 trillion economy in the year 2000, to a 10 trillion economy was not driven by FDI as most pundits in India would have believe. But by a massive expansion in credit and therefore investment . Something to the tune $40 trillion dollars. This has led to what many believe its a massive credit crisis resulting for mal-investment, and the root cause of the asset bubbles around China. Not to mention the slowdown of economy.

Latest figures show India's NPA's stood at 5.3 percent. 

http://www.livemint.com/Industry/PSkRuIxPOtkZBDECcgTHIK/Allout-efforts-on-to-bring-down-PSU-banks-NPA-Jaitley.html

So what does this tell us? 

1. Massive amount of corruption in lending especially by PSU's.
2. A small percentage of Indians mostly a few big wigs and politically connected people continue to avail loans without any significant collateral, and when they can't pay back these loans the politicians just help the restructure loans.

How times will the tax payers have to bailout these banks? Even if we do bail them out this time which we have. How long before we are at the same place again. People say oh we will implement basel 3.  But let me ask you this, India already implements most of the capital adequacy standards asked for in Basel 3 so what will basel 3 do?

All this is crony capitalism of the highest standard. 

And now with the latest meeting happening today in the finance. The corporate sleazeballs have asked for their NPA's to be restructured under a separate vehicle known as the restructure bank so 'lending can start again'. 

What really needs to be done and will never be done because the corporate 'honchos' which the fiscal hawks that Modi supporters are in awe of, continue to use PSU banks as their own piggy bank. Of course a lack of backlash because of blind supporters means nothing going to change.

In reality whats needs to be done is no restructuring and bailouts but real changes.

1.Privatise all PSU banks.

2. Create a watchdog which is independent like the RBI to oversee lending standards. 

3.Implement stronger lending standard with internetional standards to account for fraud, and international models which banks like JP morgan etc use when they lend.

Again I don't see this happening. Caravan just published an article (on Ruai's but its all the same anyway) which shows how audacious the Adanis' and Ambanis are. And how they constantly just get more and more money every year.  Meanwhile I don't expect Modi supporters to ever go against their dear leader .

So enjoy paying taxes and saving with PSU's only for your money to directed towards crony capitalism. 
",Whathappenedyaar," >Create a watchdog which is independent like the RBI to oversee lending standards.

>3.Implement stronger lending standard with internetional standards to account for fraud, and international models which banks like JP morgan etc use when they lend

I think you also need some bit of education on economics and business. 

On one hand you talk of privatizing the PSU banks but then you talk of creating another watchdog. You can't keep interfering in the business processes of Banks and other industries. You can't have a watchdog dictating the Debt/Equity and interest coverage ratios. That's moronic to say the least. Your recommendation means another Babu ruled organization which would be half idiotic and half corrupt. This can't solve the problem. 

Your JP Morgan example is funny to say the least. Read about the [JP Morgan's Amtek Fiasco in India just last week here] (http://www.livemint.com/Money/fWAEqNlPE916gYLJzbAxZL/Indias-bond-market-investors-anxious-as-Amtek-India-roils-J.html)

What happened to your great JP Morgan model there? FYI, Even the JP Morgans of the world incur NPAs (heard of the US Mortgage crisis?).

Now coming to the Indian PSU banks. Yes, that's a problem. The whole nationalizations of banks by Indira Gandhi was a big mistake. But that's history and we are here whether we like it or not. 

Yes, long term solution is the privatization of these banks. But what do we do Today. What do we do here and now? Is the country prepared for a one sweep nationalization of PSUs? Are the political parties prepared for it? are the bank unions prepared for it (they are not even allowing SBI merger with subsidiaries). The answer is NO. 

So the solution, the only solution, albeit short term, is recapitalization of these banks. That will enable the regrowth of credit in the country.

While we are at it, let me also educate you on the Banking sector structure of India. There are PSU Banks, there are old Private sector banks, there are new private sector banks, there are cooperative banks, there are NBFCs and then there are foreign banks in India. 

Now the cooperative banks, old pvt sector banks and NBFCs are small and not relevant to our discussion here. That leaves PSUs, new Pvt Banks (mostly ICICI, HDFC, Kotak, Yes, Axis) and Foreign Banks. 

Any country for industry and infrastructure needs long term funding (project loans). Where does that come from? The answer is PSU banks. 

The Foreign banks only want fee income (treasury, forex, wealth, investment banking and hawala). The private banks want housing loans, car loans, credit cards and personal loans. These banks do not want to take long term exposures (reasons beyond the scope for this session). 

In such a scenario, SBI (and other PSUs) are the only port of call for long term lending for building power plants, ports and steel plants. They did that and got over exposed. A large part of the NPAs are a function of business cycle and bad credit calls. But a big enough part is because of corruption (which emanates from the forced lending triggered by the politicians). 

That's it for today.  NPAs of PSUs increased 4 fold during the time of the UPA. 

Here's the deal. India was ruled by 50 years of congress, most recently, for 10 years. Rest of your numbers...baah.

India needs to push growth. The best way of doing it is by requesting investments which happens only through what Modi is doing and has done. Now, please wait and watch for 4 more years. Keep your critiques until next election. Its too early for you. can someone please post in layman terms (or tl;dr). I've read it twice, still not getting it. Isn't this like common knowledge? Nobody thinks the NPAs are some conspiracy right? I ask because I've seen worse on this sub. > I write this knowing that Modi supporters seriously lack understanding of the lending business,economics and business in general and will probably make some half-assed excuse for the 75000 crore bailout but lets look at some figures

LOL so you think provisioning for BASEL 3 is a puny ass reason.

> And now with the latest meeting happening today in the finance. The corporate sleazeballs have asked for their NPA's to be restructured under a separate vehicle known as the restructure bank so 'lending can start again'.

LOLWUT... where? I too think you need some education about macro economics and finance. Looks like you've taken some layman articles and strung it together.

* As an Emerging Market we have certain leeway in terms of bad loans.

* Like you pointed out, while our corporate loans are 58% and China's 160% of GDP: this is how it should be.

* Even at that, China's corporate loans are a matter not completely known. They are good at hiding loans and not letting them show up in macro level calculations. Which is why most investors aren't surprised at China's recent market crash. They are worried about linkages with their own markets, yes, as are Indian investors, but no one is surprised.

* I don't have the energy to educate you from scratch. Read thishttp://www.livemint.com/Opinion/3aQIB8wqizRuOEf6nKJFBI/How-high-are-Indian-banks-bad-loans.html

>The Reserve Bank of India’s annual report, while acknowledging the problem, points out: **“Compared over time and across countries, India’s NPAs (non-performing assets) are not high. Historically, the gross NPA ratio was at 12% in March 2001.”** A little melodramatic, but the point you make is clear that NPA's are rising, our DRT's take too long to recover cash from the NPA's and that PSU's can bail out Corporate's only for so long. (which corporates though? as far as i know only GMR and DLF are in big trouble and if in US would have been filing for bankruptcy by now, but here in India they keep getting bank loan after bank loan). I disagree with all the naysayers here, this is a topic worth writing a post about and being dismissive about it instead of examining the points make shows the immaturity of the respondents and not of OP. >I write this knowing that Modi supporters seriously lack understanding of the lending business,

How BJP is ensuring their monotony in Indian politics and stay in power,0,61l7in,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/61l7in/how_bjp_is_ensuring_their_monotony_in_indian/,7,"There are many polices initiated by NDA after they came to power. 
For example,
* Financial inclusion
* The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015
* Direct subsidies
* Aadhaar
* Demonetization
* Recent financial bill etc

When we take a closer look at these policies, we can see a certain pattern of corruption and dirty politics in them.

For example, **the electoral Bonds** ( http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/explaining-electoral-bonds-in-india/article9524904.ece) . This is a policy to increase the fund of the BJP and its allies. Now, people can buy this bonds and fund parties anomalously. While the identity of the donor is captured, it is not revealed to the party or public. So transparency is not enhanced for the voter. 

No doubt, The denomination has removed dirty money from the market. Now, political parties do not have access to hoarded money to fund their election just like before. In a country like India, where a good part of population is ready to sell their vote for money due to their ignorance or lack of knowledge, this is a big blow to opposing parties like congress. 

The Aadhaar became a surveillance tool for the govt. The NDA govt had amended the 2010 Aadhaar act with some scary stuff last year. Source : https://thewire.in/118655/hello-aadhaar-goodbye-privacy/

Now there are 22 mandatory notification for **voluntary** Aadhaar in this year.  Source : https://thewire.in/115125/aadhaar-timeline-mandatory-notifications/

The recent financial bill gave more (read ultimate) power to tax wing. They can inspect and seize anything they want, wherever they want and whenever they want now. 

You may ask all this are good, right? 

Maybe not. 

For example,take the example of The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015 . The penalty for nondisclosure of foreign income or assets would be equal to three times the amount of tax payable, in addition to tax payable at 30%. But if you want to get out of the hook, buy an electoral bond and bribe the party in position. The govt has guaranteed the anonymity of the donor. Sure, the issuing bank has the data of the buyer, but since all national banks are coming under a single roof under government, the promise of anonymity and receiver not knowing about the name of donor, the banks, donor and parties are safe in the bribing process. 

And, if someone want to protest against all these, be careful , you are naked in front of the govt. All your data, your financial, assets, tele identity, everything is there in front of them. What they have to do is just pull a bizarre thing like porn, torrent downloads etc into paper and screw you. Or they can seek the help of the funded medias and shame you in front of public. 

The govt. has already said that privacy is not a fundamental rights. We are losing our faith in judiciary anyway. Here is more info on mass surveillance in India. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_India

http://www.freepressjournal.in/business/6-issues-that-should-scare-you-in-arun-jaitleys-finance-bill-2017/1040710",memwa," Op has posted a huge block of text that makes 2 points

-'BJP has made funding more opaque' This applies equally to all political parties, not just them. 

-'BJP is conducting mass surveillance' India has had a well-oiled surveillance machinery under the Intelligence Bureau for decades, and government bureaucrats have always been at the mercy of the politicians they serve. Neither of this has changed in any significant manner over the decades.

So no, the BJP has not done anything that would ensure their 'monotony' over Indian politics. OP has wasted a lot of time to make two redundant points.

 I will add one more thing . 

BJP is moving to a very sophisticated form of big corruption as huge funds are required for electoral politics. Both in JH and CG , state govt. would be selling liquor , now what's bad in that ?

given now govt. has control over which brand is available and at what rate at different counters across state and given the margins in liquor business - it's a very sweet form of corruption w/o much effect on masses. There have been huge protest in Chhattisgarh wrt to state entering liquor business ( opposition parties want complete prohibition) 

BJP has alleviated themselves from petty corruption via this . There are other indications that BJP is moving to high stakes corporate corruption , this way they can still get the money they need w/o any adverse public sentiment .",Business/Finance,2017-03-26 19:52:41

Honorable Mr. Narendra Modi,

Prime Minister,

Government of India,

Raisina Hill,

New Delhi – 110011

**Subject:** To appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta, to take the right decision on various strong anti-corruption bills and to implement farmers’ issues as per the recommendations of the Swami Nathan Committee Report, I intend to hold an agitation in Delhi…


Honorable Sir,

Dreaming of a corruption-free India, there was a historic citizen agitation across the country, steered from Ramlila Maidan in 2011. Seeing the impact of this agitation, the Parliament on 27th August, 2011, had passed the resolution in the 'Sense of the House’ session. In which, the central government would frame, at the earliest, laws of appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta as well as a Citizen Charter. On the basis of this resolution, the central government had given a written assurance and with that hope, I concluded my agitation on 28th August. As a sequel to this resolution and the historic event, which enthused the citizens with hope, a good six years have passed by. However, even after six years, not a single Law pertaining to anti-corruption has been implemented. Distressed with this situation, I am writing this letter to you.

After your government came to power, for three consecutive years, I have communicated to you regarding appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta through my letters dated 28/08/2014, 18/10/2014, 01/01/2015, 01/01/2016, 19/01/2017 and 28/03/2017. However, there has been no reply form you regarding action on the same.

In order that corruption should be curtailed, the citizens of this country had held a peaceful agitation in Ram Lila Maidan, for the establishment of the law, appointing Lokpal and Lokayukta. At that time, crores of people had come out on the streets, from scores of villages, towns and cities. Because, lives of citizens has become miserable due to large-scale corruption that directly affects their lives. Children from schools and youths from colleges had also come out on the streets. For the first-time, since Independence, such a large number of people had come out on the streets to campaign against corruption. This entire agitation was done peacefully, without any violence.

During the agitation, lakhs of people came on the streets but not one person threw a stone. Hence, this agitation was talked about respectfully in various countries across the world. Perceiving the nature of this agitation as one of public empowerment, the then government passed the law for appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta in the Rajya Sabha, on 17th December 2013 and in the Loksabha on 18th December 2013. It was passed by absolute majority in both the houses. After that, on 1st January 2014, the President of India signed the law to make it into an Act. At that time, the opposition leaders of both the houses had supported the bill. Thereafter, on 26th May 2014, your party came into power. Since then, I’ve been writing to you for three years for the implementation of the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act.

After the Lokpal agitation, the citizens, with great hope, elected the new government under your leadership. It was necessary to give the government some time for due implementation of the Acts. Keeping this in mind, I kept sending you various letters on this issue, as reminders. Neither have you implemented the same or taken any action on my letters. Nor have you had a dialogue on this issue or spoke about Lokpal and Lokayukta in your `Man ki Baat.’ Before coming to power, you had assured the citizens of India that ‘You will give priority to make India, corruption-free.’ Now, also, through large scale advertisements you convey to the public, that for the making of New India, it is necessary to take a pledge to stand against corruption. However, now also, in every State, no work of a citizen is done, without giving money. Implying, that without corruption, issues directly related to citizens, has not decreased.

With the implementation of the Lokpal and Lokayukta Law, 50%-60% of corruption can be curbed. Yet, you are not implementing this law. To curb corruption, along with Lokpal and Lokayukta Act laws like the Right to Reject and Right to Recall will help in curbing corruption. However, you are silent on these laws too. The Prevention of Bribery of Foreign Public officials and Officials of Public International Organization Bill 2011, Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill 2012, The Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill, The Public Procurement Bill 2012 are bills that will curtail corruption, but are pending for 4-5 years in the Parliament. The then government had brought in this bill, four years back. You are neither speaking nor doing anything about this delay.

In order to curb corruption and to strengthen democracy, de-centralization of power is very essential. In order to decentralize power, it is necessary to bring in Law that will strengthen the power of the Gramsabha. The village itself is the owner of its resources. There should be a law that the water, forest and land of the village should not to be taken without the permission of the Gram Sabha. The power of the secretariat should be in the hands of the people-that is, true democracy. However, despite writing letters to you for three years, you have kept mum. Then, how can India, become corruption free?

? It is not in mere making of pledges in front of the public, but in wresting rights in the hands of the people, that India will become corruption-free. The Right to Information Act, is one such example. The most distressing fact is that, despite there being such provision in the law, you are not appointing Lokpal and Lokayukta. The Supreme Court has time and again, directed you to appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta, but your government is still not doing so, despite the fact that this would curb corruption. At one end, you are appointing CBI Chief without the existence of the opposition leader and at the other end, you are giving the excuse of not appointing the Lokpal and Lokayukta, on the pretext that the opposition leader does not exist. This is most unfortunate.
It is surprising that you are giving excuses to appoint Lokayukta and Lokpal. Because, in the Lokpal and Lokayukta Law, it is not mandatory to have the opposition leader’s consent.

Even then, in these three years, no State Government, which is run by you, has appointed Lokpal and Lokayukta. In States where opposition parties have formed the government, there are no appointments of Lokpal and Lokayukta but it is unfortunate that the appointments have not been made in States that are ruled by your party. This makes it clear that you do not have the will to appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta. There is a gap between your talks and your action. Then, how can India, become corruption-free? Isn’t it a humiliation for the Parliament which passed the law, the President of India who signed it and for the citizens who campaigned for it through large scale of agitations?

What is surprising Is that of course there is no appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta in the States where opposition parties are ruling but even in States run by your party, no Lokpal or Lokayukta have been appointed.

In the Agriculture dominated country, India, farmers are committing suicide every day. I have written to you several times on giving farmers, prices as per their costs but I have not received any reply from you nor have you implemented recommendations of the Swami Nathan Committee Report. Since the last few days, farmers in various states like Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana and Rajasthan are coming together and agitating. However, you do not seem to be having any compassion for farmers’ woes. It is clear from this that you have done these amendments not in the interest of the nation and its people but in the interest of party and business owners. This is indeed unfortunate.

It has been clearly noticed over the last three years that you have no compassion in your heart for the grievances of the farmers of the country. Had it been the case, you would have made provision while making the amendments allowing the companies to give any amounts as donations to farmers instead of political parties. Had you done this, it would have strengthened our democracy and restored faith that poverty will be eliminated. It would have provided justice to poor farmers. However, your failure to do so proves that you have no compassion for the poor and farmers. Over the last 42 years, the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill was tabled before the Parliament on several occasions but could not be passed. However, the Peoples’ Parliament of the nation awakened in August 2011 and the government had to promulgate the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act. Your government has been disrespecting public sentiments in this regard too. 
Therefore, now the time has come to awaken the voters, who are the owners of this country. An awakened voter is the foundation of democracy.

Instead, your government while using some of the amendments you have made while incorporating the Finance Bill 2017 in the Money Bill as illustrations. I shall elaborate on the remaining amendments publically at the time of the agitation. Earlier, there was provision that enabled any company to donate 7.5 per cent of the money earned as profits by it over a period of three years to political parties. However, now you have made amendment and removed the limit of 7.5 per cent and made provision that any company can donate any amount to political parties. The limit for giving donations to political parties have been removed for political parties. Because of this, not democracy but Party machinery will become stronger. If you were truly concerned about farmers and poor people, then you would have done proper research of this Law and stated that any amount of donation can be given, not to political parties but to the farmers and the poor people. That would have made democracy, strong and it would have provided justice to the farmers and poor people. However, it is very clear that you do not have the innate compassion for the poor and for the farmers. If you really want to solve the issues of the farmers, then implementing the Swami Nathan Committee Report, you would have ensured proper prices for the farmers’ produce as per the cost and in order to ensure security to farmers and laborers, it is essential to have a pension scheme.
Citizens have been campaigning for political parties to come under Right to Information Act. Supreme Court too has given clear directives. If you firmly believe in transparency, then it is essential to introspect on political parties coming under the RTI Act.


In order to decentralize power, it is necessary to bring in Law that will strengthen the power of the Gramsabha. To curb corruption, along with Lokpal and Lokayutta Act laws like the Right to Reject and Right to Recall will help in curbing corruption. It is also necessary to bring in laws for women’s’ equality. How can you talk of women’s equality just by putting up posters? In order to curb corruption and to strengthen democracy, de-centralization of power is very essential. The village itself is the owner of its resources. There should be a law that the water, forest and land of the village should not to be taken without the permission of the Gram Sabha. The power of the secretariat should be in the hands of the people-that is, true democracy. If you give the power in the hands of the citizens, then democracy will be strengthened. When the public parliament wakes up there would be a logical end to the issues of Lokpal, Lokayukta, farmers’ problems and other issues. I am confident about that.


Earlier, on 28th March, 2017, I had written a letter to you, that if you do not implement the Lokpal and Lokayukta Law, then my next letter would be about holding another agitation in Delhi. It is in reference with that letter, that I have decided to launch an agitation, for the betterment of the society and the nation.
I have been doing agitations since 35 years. However, I have my agitations were never against any political group, party or any particular individual. My only mission for doing agitations is for the betterment of the society and nation. Since the last three years, I have been reminding the government about the appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta and of farmers receiving appropriate prices for their produce. However, you have not replied to my letters nor have you taken any action on these issues. Hence, I have decided to hold an agitation in Delhi. Until, for the larger public interest, the above issues are not addressed through implementation of the same, I will relentlessly continue my agitation. You shall be informed about my date and venue of my agitation, in my next letter.

Jai Hind!

Yours Sincerely

Defence Wrap - Week of 14-19 March 2017,12,61m3bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/61m3bn/defence_wrap_week_of_1419_march_2017/,2,"**Challenges ahead of the new Defense Minister**

* Mr. Manohar Parrikar stepped down as the Defense Minister on Mar‐13 to be sworn‐in as the Goa CM on Mar‐14. Same day Finance Minister Mr. Arun Jaitley took additional charge of the Defense Ministry.

* Rumor mills even indicate that this is a stop‐gap arrangement and soon we could see a new Defense Minister, as handling 2 key ministries would be very challenging.

* Outgoing Defense Minister resolved issues like, One Rank One Pension (OROP), rolled‐out DPP, 2016 (addressed some of the Defense procurement issues with a view to encourage private sector participation), made policy changes to encourage MSME participation in the sector.

* Policy framework to encourage private sector participation, simplification of procurement procedures were based on recommendations of committee’s set‐up by him.

* However, with new Defense Minister taking the helm of affairs, we sense the key challenge would be to take forward unfinished work by the outgoing Defense minister at the earliest.

* The ‘Make in India’ is yet to kick off, as many private players having heavily invested in the sector are awaiting on the sideways to take on government orders for ships, helicopters and land systems.

* These projects are likely to be awarded under the ‘Strategic Partnership’ policy. For over 12 months, private sector has been asking for the award of such platform projects on competitive basis, whereas government wants to select private company for a long‐term 'guaranteed work' period.

* This difference of opinion has been a long bone of contention between the industry and Defense Ministry. The new Defense Ministry has to address this big issue as private sector has been long waiting with patience.

**OFB to get order for 155mm shells from UAE**

* India had signed Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) with UAE government on Jan 25, 2017. As part of CSP (which includes areas Defense & Security) deals from Air & Naval Defense were expected to be signed sooner.

* Media reports indicate that Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) is close to bagging an order to make 155mm extended bore full range shells of boat‐tail version, which are used in Bofors‐type Artillery guns (with over 35 kms range) for UAE. Once UAE made the proposal to India in last week of Feb‐2017, India signed the agreement and UAE on its part is yet to sign the documents.

* Since the Jan 25, 2017 meeting, following are some of the key agreements signed,

 * Offshore Patrol vessels and Frigates/Corvettes (UAE has been buying them from USA, Europe),

 * supply Interceptor boats developed by L&T & Private players,

 * 100 SPAD guns project to L&T in partnership with Korean company (project to cost ~Rs 9‐10 bn).
 * Also, RDEL signed strategic MoU with Emirates Defense Industries Company (UAE based integrated defense company).

* OFB bagging this project would give major fillip to them as they have been majorly dependent on IA for their orders. OFB makes 2 versions of shells, boat‐tail and base‐bleed versions.

* Boattail version is an older version and OFB has expertise in making indigenously this variant of shell. These shells are likely to be made at OFB’s Nagpur, Chandrapur and Bhandara plants.

* OFB to‐date has exported 50‐odd products (like Brake parachutes for Su30 & MiG‐29 Fighters, 91mm TRA gun for Navy, Small caliber Ammunition, Prahari‐ the 12.7 Air Defense Gun) to countries like Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, USA and Germany.

* On being awarded this Rs 2.35bn project, OFB’s exports order‐book will zoom‐up 10x (currently exports from OFB are in Rs200‐500mn range).
* We see this development to be very positive, as this is in line with our ex‐Defense Minister’s vision to promote India as Defense export hub. Ex‐Defense Minister had set $2 bn of Defense exports target from India for next 2 years. Growing ties with Mauritius, UAE, Vietnam and Myanmar indicate that Indian Defense eco‐system is working towards achievement of the $2bn Defense exports target.

**Update on Indo‐Russian delegates meet**

* On Mar 17‐18 both, Indian and Russian Defense ministries and corporate representatives met to discuss possibilities of manufacturing spare parts and ammunition for Russian origin Aircraft and Military platforms.
* India and Russia signed 2 Long‐Term Service Agreements (LTSA) for new spares delivery schedule from Russia, a logistics hub in Bangalore and domestic manufacturing of parts by HAL for 200 Su‐30MKI fighter jets, which in future would exceed to 270 Aircrafts. As per agreement, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and United Engine Corporation (UEC) will render technical support; provide maintenance services and spares to the fleet for next 5 years worth $300mn.
* The pacts were signed between HAL and the 2 Russian companies. UAC has acquired the right to supply spare parts and do the repair and servicing of the Aircraft it delivered earlier in Dec‐ 2016 only.
* UAC also signed an agreement with HAL to provide lifecycle support and maintenance for Mi‐17 helicopters, MiG‐29K fighter jet, T‐90 tanks and INS Vikramaditya Aircraft Carrier.
* On the sidelines of an event, Russian Trade and Industry Minister, Denis Manturov revealed that M&M subsidiary is working closely in creating the interiors for Sukhoi Super Jet. Russia is negotiating with M&M on MC‐21 Aircraft, a civil aviation project, which is soon to have its maiden flight soon. Also, Russia is negotiating with M&M and other private players to manufacture components for another project 2114 (a Commercial Aircraft project).
* Another Russian official confirmed that an agreement is soon to be finalized for the supply of 60 Multi‐purpose Kazan Helicopters under Phase‐I, whereas, joint facilities would be set up in India to manufacture another 140 helicopters.
* >60% of Indian Defense Equipment platforms procured since 1960’s are of Russian origin. The current serviceability rate of the IAF and IN fleet is <50% owing to lack of spares.
* We view deals between HAL and 2 Russian companies to be big positive, as IAF would now find ease in the procurement of spares from HAL. In 2014, the serviceability rates of Su‐30MKI fighter jets were at 46%. However, post setting‐up the Rs 4 bn after sales service centre for both, Su‐30MKI fighter jets & Helicopters, the serviceability rates have increased to 60%. In other words, it means that of the total fleet size of ~230 Su‐30MKI fighter jets, ~138 of them are ready for missions at any given time.
* MoD some time back had set an ardent task of increasing the serviceability rate to ~75% levels.
* This is in‐line with MoD’s strategy to bring the entire IAF Fighter Jet fleet to global serviceability standard of ~75% levels. This could be gauged from the recent Rafale deal signed, where the French government has promised India, that Rafale will ensure 75% serviceability rate. Also, steep penalties have been imposed if timelines are not adhered.
* We see the 2 agreements between HAL and the Russian companies for technical support; provide maintenance services and spares to the fleet for next 5 years to be in‐line with MoD’s strategy to further improve the serviceability rate of the Su‐30MKI Fighter Jet fleet.
* As a result of this initiative, we expect (1) spares cost (on per unit basis) to decline, and (2) DPSU’s and smaller unlisted players to benefit.
* Also, we see positive development from M&M subsidiaries point of view, as the much awaited uptick in their Aerospace business kick‐in. However, we see some meaningful contribution from the Russian side of Aerospace to be seen from FY2018 onwards only.
* Lastly, proposed JV for manufacture of Kazan Ka‐226T was an inter‐governmental agreement
* Signed in Dec‐2015, between Russian Helicopters, JSC Rosoboronexport & HAL. This agreement
assures localization of the production and supply of 200 Light Multi‐role Ka‐226T over a period
of 9 years. First 60 helicopters of them will be produced in Russia, while the remaining 140
helicopters will be produced in India.
* On a whole, this Indian‐Russian delegates meeting concluded with 2 deals signed and making way for few more in the pipeline.

**Lakshya‐II tested successfully**

* IAF successfully test‐flew the Advanced version of Pilot‐less Target Aircraft (PTA) Lakshya‐II on Mar‐15 from the Integrated Test Range off at Odisha coast.
* During the 30 minute flight, this PTA was made to dive at different altitudes, demonstrate various technologies and subsystems including software correction.
* This PTA has a sub‐sonic and re‐usable aerial target system, is remote controlled from ground and designed to impart training to both air‐borne and air‐defense pilots.
* It’s required to evaluate and develop trials of new surface‐to‐air and air to‐air weapon systems.
The test was carried out to check the validity of its engine and duration enhancement.
* Lakshya‐II is designed and developed by Bangalore‐based Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE), a DRDO lab.

*About Lakshya Project: 
Lakshya is a reclaimable Aerial target system designed to train guns, missile crews, Air defence pilots in order to engage the targets. Powered by gas turbine engines, it is designed to be launched from land or sea through a 0‐length launcher and can be recovered by a dual‐stage parachute system. Lakshya has been designed to be reused for 15 missions.*

* Since its first test in 2012, all tests done to‐date have been successful. Still we expect induction of Lakshya‐II in to IAF would take few more quarters as few more tests are to be done.
* HAL is only company in India currently producing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s) like PTA’s.
* To‐date HAL has made 39 of Lakshya‐I at its Aircraft division, Bangalore. Of this, ~23 of them have been inducted in to IAF, IN.
* In Feb‐2015, MoD approved DRDO proposal for transfer of technology (ToT) to L&T for commercial production of Lakshya. For every Lakshya produced and commercially sold, L&T would have to pay royalty to DRDO. L&T and Tata’s have been associated with Lakshya projects since very long time. L&T produced the Launcher for the IA version and Tata’s produced the Launcher for the IAF version.
* We are of view that L&T and DRDO have already worked jointly to build the production model for Lakshya‐II.
* Also, countries like, Israel, Singapore, Malaysia in the past have shown interest to acquire Lakshya. Even though no order has been made to‐date, there exists possibility of exporting Lakshya (with MoD approval).
* On a whole, induction of Lakshya‐II in to Indian Armed Forces would be positive for companies like, HAL, L&T and Tata’s, which have been involved at different stages of manufacturing Lakshya.

**OFB to produce Mango Shells for T‐90 Main Battle Tanks**

* Tecmash, a Rostec group company announced transfer of the main part of equipment needed to OFB for enabling production of Mango Shells for T‐90 tanks in India.
* Tecmash also finished training Indian specialists for the production of Mango shells.
* Mango shells are feathered armor‐piercing projectiles for 125 mm caliber tank guns.
* Production of the shells was launched in the USSR in 1983 and put into service in 1986.
* This development comes in the back‐drop of a contract to supply 66,000 Mango Shells was signed with India in 2014 worth $ 470mn.
* We view this to be positive development as it adds one more feather to OFB’s capabilities to make Mango Shells, which are used by T‐90 Tanks. Given that the final batch of these Mango Shells was delivered recently, we do not see a large ticket awarding for these Mango shells by IA in the next 3‐6 months at least.


**IAF to get 6 new C‐130J S with Terrain Warning System**

* As per solicitation posted by US Air Force on US Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps), IAF is to get 6 new Lockheed Martin C‐130J Hercules Transport Aircraft equipped with Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS). This subscription will run for 40 months starting 31 May‐ 2017 through till 31 Aug‐2020.
* Responses for this solicitation are to be submitted by Mar‐30, 2017.
* IAF currently fields 4 C‐130Js, having ordered 6 of them in 2008 (as 2 of them met accidents).
* These 6 Aircrafts that are being solicited were contracted in Dec‐2013 for $ 1.1 bn.
* As with the current fleet, these Aircraft are to be fitted with defensive aids, Indian‐specific communication systems, and chin‐mounted electro‐optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor turrets.
* Solicitation to get the new 6 Lockheed Martin C‐130J Hercules Transport Aircraft equipped with Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) indicates that government is focused to spend on Aircraft safety. TAWS are being deployed globally to prevent the occurrence of any accidents.
* It is after 2 of the C‐130J Hercules got damaged in 2014 & 2017 MoD took the decision to equip TAWS in to these 6 new Military Transport Aircrafts to avoid any further accidents.
* On a whole, we see this to be a positive development for the IAF fleet.

*Current situation* :

GDP growth down to 5.7%. Remember that if we use old method  of GDP calculation this 5.7% is actually 3.7%.

Inflation at 5 month high, https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi

Credit growth is down by a lot, http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/c-p-chandrasekhar/growth-in-the-time-of-a-credit-squeeze/article9795693.ece

Crude price is at 4 month high. This may temporarily mean higher GDP growth because margins for oil companies etc will go up. In long term it puts more pressure on FM.

Global situation is likely to be stable.

*Questions* :-

With tax collections dropping FM cannot boost GDP with government expenditure. I doubt the government will give a stimulus package without a major hit to fiscal deficit targets.

With inflation high RBI has less leeway in reducing interest rates.

Will Govt cut spending on social schemes like NREGA so close to 2019? Will govt spend less on Armed forces?

Most importantly for me personally, will government cut corporate taxes, income taxes?

Will Modi be able to use executive prowess i.e. fast clearances, attracting investments, inspire confidence to get GDP growth back on track?

What is the actual impact of GDP slowdown to common man voter of modi?

You were thinking straight OP, why the confusion? Work for an year or two. Learn about Business before getting an MBA. You will create a deeper sense to understand business concept from work experience.

If you want to be just another MBA-salary lover go ahead and do that. If you really want to do something with that MBA in future, do some work now.

Even if you want to do your MBA, do it after a few years.   

Making a success out of a business like your dad has done so is no mean achievement. 19 out of 20 new businesses fail. If your dad has run a successful business, he is already ahead of a lot of MBAs. I am sure you will learn a lot working with him. I got MBBS and then a Thullu",Business/Finance,2017-03-11 14:37:22
Mega Discussion thread: Demands for Grants 2015-16 of Central Government | Parliament Budget Session 2015,42,333ipd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/333ipd/mega_discussion_thread_demands_for_grants_201516/,17,"Hello /r/india,

I thought it would be an interesting exercise to seek your views about the Demands for Grants for ministries this year. These documents show how much money is being proposed to be allotted for every ministry. *The increase/decrease in the grants indicates the focus areas of this Government.*

[Here is a summary of all demands](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dgsum.pdf). It will help you quickly glance through the major figures.

[Another detailed summary which will help you see each demand for departments under the ministries](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/alldg.pdf)

[Ministry-wise detailed demands can be found here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/dg.asp?pageid=1)

Example of how we can go about discussing this: I found something interesting [here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dg30.pdf) with regards to Drinking water and sanitation. The budget for the previous year Rs 12,217 cr, it has been slashed to Rs 6,243 cr.  That's a 48% reduction. I am trying to figure out why is there such a big drop and how it will affect the overall scene of national water resources. 

I must tell you that I am no expert in finance. So perhaps some of you who do work in the area can help me waddle through this massive budget? And in the process, find out what is happening to the ministries that interest you.

If you put up some interesting suggestions, I will include your inputs in the brief I am preparing for MP /u/tathagatasatpathy. 

Session resumes tomorrow and you can follow the budget discussion as it happens. I will alert /r/india regarding that everyday by putting up the [List of Business](http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Business/listOfBusinessCurrent.aspx) for the next day, so that this can become a daily input seeking session.

EDIT: Drop in expenditure wrt state subjects might be mostly because of [devolution of funds to states](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/finance-commission-recommends-42-of-central-devolution-to-states-115022400304_1.html) as recommended by the Finance Commission. Thanks /u/bhaiyamafkaro for pointing that out.",kumbhakaran," Government has implemented the advice of the finance commission given states more revenue thus it will have to cut its own expenditure from somewhere.   Why do we have a ministry that supports homeopathy and why are we planning to spend 1200 crores on it? Awesome initiative! Thanks /u/kumbhakaran .

I have a question regarding the [summary of all demands document](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dgsum.pdf). The three columns are a little confusing. 

Is the first column what was allocated in the previous budget ? The second column how much was actually spent ? And the third what are the funds allocated for the following year ?

Thanks for the informative post/documents.

Mods, please sticky this. Looking forward to some healthy discussions. 

Edit : And haha, is your username a typo ? :P > The budget for the previous year Rs 12,217 cr, it has been slashed to Rs 6,243 cr. That's a 48% reduction. I am trying to figure out why is there such a big drop and how it will affect the overall scene of national water resources.

IIRC one of the reasons put forward is that the previous allocations weren't even being utilized completely so this is a move to extract maximum bang for the buck and curb wastage. I read this here in one of the threads a few weeks back but I'm not sure if this discussion was in relation to potable water or not. Nevertheless, OP can check the utilization numbers against the budget numbers and confirm. On a side note the budget this year is way better than prolly in last 10 years. I have a question for you bro.

Since devaluation to states has been bumped up I am pretty sure your state is going to get a LOT of cash. Any plans on spending it yet? How do you plan on allotting the money?

I was frankly worried about corruption when it comes to giving more money to states directly, u wanna know why? there is a ministry of culture in WB which funds all TMC events indirectly. corruption of the highest order. My personal belief is that all funds extra to states should be invested into infrastructure building because it is the only thing were there is a chance of return on investment. (business wise that makes more sense to me)

The budget has laid down a path wrt fiscal consolidation. I still have my doubts on how it will be achieved. but considering that 4.1 figure what achieved I can trust intentions. I guess one of the key areas that need work is centre state coordination regarding speedy implementation of projects. like in WB, the govt has fucked up metro big time, they dont wanna build a station because they gotta displace muslim hawkers. (sic) . a metro station benfits 10 lakh people daily and you wanna prevent that for votes. This kind of attitude should be punished with strict budget cuts from the centre. (which did happen, but not that strict imo)

Also: the revenue generation: centre is doing good job, but instead of selling they should be SERIOUSLY considering rejuvenating PSU which can make profits easily. one of the only things that need to be concentrated on is revenue generation. no plan was laid out for revenue generation by FM. some details would be nice. like a vision or , a list.

still going thru all docs but this is just some things from the top off my mind ~~Any one any idea what the Ministry of culture does ?~~

Edit : Never mind, found their website http://www.indiaculture.nic.in/mission-statement. What is charged and voted in every ministry's budget? 


Edit: why downvotes?  >The budget for the previous year Rs 12,217 cr, it has been slashed to Rs 6,243 cr. That's a 48% reduction. I am trying to figure out why is there such a big drop and how it will affect the overall scene of national water resources.

Not trying to politicize the issue but with all the hullabaloo going about swach bharat......it just puts govt's intention directly in question. Hope I am wrong because sometimes they apportion the money under different heads but are essentially targeting the same cause.",Business/Finance,2015-04-19 12:21:30
An excellent piece on funding of [P]olitical parties which seems source of all evil (read failing) of a democracy,20,6970p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6970p6/an_excellent_piece_on_funding_of_political/,0,"The text at the end of this article reverberates about how essential it is for us, this is from Justice M.C.

Now, democracy is a political system which ensures decisions by discussion and debate, but the discussion and debate must be conducted honestly and objectively and decisions must be arrived at on merits without being influenced or actuated by any extraneous considerations. On first impression, it would appear that any attempt on the part of anyone to finance a political party is likely to contaminate the very springs of democracy. Democracy would be vitiated if results are to be arrived at not on their merits, but because money played a part in the bringing about of those decisions. The form and trappings of democracy may continue, but the spirit underlying democratic institutions will disappear. History of democracy has proved that in other countries democracy has been smothered by big business and money bags playing an important part in the working of democratic institutions and it is the duty not only of politicians, not only of citizens, but even of a Court of law, to the extent that it has got the power, to prevent any influence being exercised upon the voter which is an improper influence or which may be looked at from any point of view as a corrupt influence. The very basis of democracy is the voter and when in India we are dealing with adult suffrage it is even more important than elsewhere that not only the integrity of the representative who is ultimately elected to Parliament is safeguarded, but that the integrity of the voter is also safeguarded, and it may be said that it is difficult to accept the position that the integrity of the voter and of the representative is safeguarded if large industrial concerns are permitted to contribute to political funds to bring about a particular result.",desibarter,,Business/Finance,2017-05-04 19:50:03
Is everything all right with Indian Railways? No.,6,40wqci,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/40wqci/is_everything_all_right_with_indian_railways_no/,18,"There is this perception that is being created that Indian railways is performing very well under Suresh Prabhu. Some announcements, anecdotes and his own prompt response on twitter are often given as an evidence. But the reality as often is the case is more nuanced than that. Let's see some news from other side of the aisle: 

> [Rail freight volume tumbles in November
](http://www.livemint.com/Money/vWAdyKIjZiZ0ZwJH9FzPzJ/Rail-freight-volume-tumbles-in-November.html)

> Deceleration in freight volume growth is a continuing saga at the Indian Railways. **Compared with 8.5% growth a year ago, freight volumes fell 4.2% in November this year**. In November 2013, volume grew 3%

> Even passenger volumes have dropped 2.6% 

> Thanks to rate hikes, gross earnings of the Indian Railways till October are 8% higher than the previous year. But they are almost 9% lower than the budget estimates

[Slowing rail freight volume growth points to poor state of economy](http://www.livemint.com/Money/dtcu77hT9hX5n7TgsgUMGL/Slowing-rail-freight-volume-growth-points-to-poor-state-of-e.html)
>
Freight volume growth slows to 2% in June quarter compared with 4% a year ago; In absolute terms, the incremental freight volumes have almost halved

> More than three-fifths of the Railways’ revenues come from freight services. The slowdown is not seen in revenue, thanks to the freight hikes. Goods revenues increased 6.5% in July. In the four months to July, they are up 13.5%. Though revenue growth is encouraging, it is way below the budget estimates. Thankfully, expenses are also rising at a slower-than-estimated pace. But the gap between the budget estimate and the actual amount is not as large as it is in the goods revenues.

> Compared with a year ago, expenditure on construction of new lines and doubling of tracks increased by more than one-third in the first four months of the current fiscal year

[Railway passenger fares may go up
](http://www.thehindu.com/business/railway-passenger-fares-may-go-up/article8082709.ece)

> Passengers may have to pay higher fares following the finance ministry’s recent decision to cut gross budgetary support to railways ministry by Rs.12,000 crore

> For freight, barring coal, the core sector is not so robust with cement, steel and construction sectors performing poorly. We may have to look at the bitter pills of increasing the passenger fares apart from cutting costs.

> Recently, the government had increased Tatkal booking charges by up to 33 per cent for travel in sleeper class, AC-III tier, AC-II tier and executive class.

> **Most vital signs of a commercial organisation are flashing red.**

> By December-end, the Railways had carried just 8 million tonnes more freight than last year. The Budget idea of carrying 85 million tonnes more by March 31, 2016, again looks difficult to achieve 

>By November, the Railways had spent only 44% of its capital expenditure budget. It has spent only 41% of funds allocated for doubling.

>**Only 28% of the Rs 1,748 crore allocated for works under passenger amenities has been spent so far.**


So we see a picture of Indian railway where it's financial health is in poor state. It is not able to meet the projected revenue and it is not able to get work done as fast as it needs to even when the funds are assured.

Other source: [Indian Railways: a vast bureaucracy tries to get back on track

This is where your analysis goes wrong.

Indian railways performing badly is not new news. It has been a loss making entity for the past 60 years (Even Lalu's famed Railways turning into profit was a huge sham). For the last decade or so, there has been no investment going in to improve the infrastructure and maintain it. It is literally on the brink of collapse.

There needs to be systemic change in the way Railway operates. That is something that has been identified by the current government. So instead of handing down more subsidies and running the railways aground, the first and easiest step is to increase fares (Which has not been increased for the last 15 years or so that I have travelled in trains starting from my college days). This has been done to support the operational expenditure of the railways (Which used to be done via a capital infusement as a part of the budget).

The next two steps would be to improve the infrastructure and increase efficiency. We already know that the infra improvement is on with the Make in India rakes coming in, and improvement in Railway station infra. Abet not at the speed at which we would like, but it is happening. The final puzzle would be the efficiency - This is going to be the biggest challenge, as railways is plagued by rowdy unionism.

So while your analysis is right that not everything is ok with railways, your question is wrong - the railways has never been ok. [deleted] [deleted] > Even passenger volumes have dropped 2.6% 

This maybe due to availability of cheap flight tickets.  Basically your key points are,

* Reduced freight volumes
* Possible hike in rail fares.

How does this indicate that the Railways ministry is doing things poorly?

From your own link,

>> “There has been a trend of over-promise and under-delivery,” Akshay Soni, a Morgan Stanley analyst, noted recently, arguing that change could now be on the way following Mr Prabhu’s arrival. **“He has brought fresh thinking to a relatively moribund railway ministry which in history has primarily been used to dispense political largesse.”**

>> **Indeed, in contrast with previous ministers whose first action was usually to build resplendent stations in their home constituencies, Mr Prabhu notes that “nobody can tell where I am from”.**



>> One of Mr Prabhu’s priorities is to cede power by decentralising decision making and granting more authority to those below him, something rare in the subcontinent. “Less government and more governance” is one of his favourite mantras, a refrain that can also be heard from the lips of his boss, the prime
minister.**

>> High quality global journalism requires investment. Please share this article with others using the link below, 

>> The system has been starved of investment for decades. In 1951, Indian Railways was 2.3 times larger than China’s. Since then, though, the situation has reversed. China’s railway is now 1.6 times the size of India’s, which has expanded a mere 21 per cent.

Thank you Nehruji, Indiraji, Rajivji, Soniaji.

>> On a recent visit to New Delhi, Jeff Immelt, GE chairman, said he had been involved in bidding on a programme to modernise the Indian rail network five times. “This is the first time I actually think it’s going to take place.”

"[R] Conflicts with mom about caste, being women and much more..",9,4j6kni,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4j6kni/r_conflicts_with_mom_about_caste_being_women_and/,8,"I wanted to post this to r/relationships, but would have taken time explaining all the caste shit, so here I am.

So, I am not a bramhim. I am from OBC who doesn't have any official paper saying that I am OBC because it won't mean much (=no monetary benefits). I am from a well-off family and I won't even need any monetary help/ reservation either. My native place is pretty small.. barely a population of 500-600 peeps. All members of my family are in the upper middle class bracket (how do I know? Well, we went from shopping for groceries for 100-500 rs, to shop for ""aesthetic"" art stuff at Jahangir Art Gallery). 

Shit is about to hit the fan so buckle up!

A month ago, my relative from native place married the woman of his dreams who doesn't belong to our caste. We are all cool with it because he did really love her and so did she and she was almost like my elder sister (I don't have one). Everyone in my family is okay, however, whenever there's talk about their marriage, my mom will always quote ""see? both his (relative's father) kids married to persons from different caste"". And this tone is always so fucking terrible, and what worst that my entire clan only SHOWS to be okay with it which I found out like yesterday.

She(bride) mingles very well with the 14-21 age group in the family. She is 25 I think and my relative is 28, it doesn't matter cause they do seem great and while he has to a stable job, she works at home and runs a beauty salon in nearby city and it's going well. The relative's elder sister (40+) also married a guy outside the caste and she was completely abandoned by her parents, till they realized that she was basically handing all finances. They ""forgave"" her, yet treat as if she no longer has any business in ""her"" family.

WHAT. THE. FUCK. IS. THIS.

Now, what's worst that all the people mentioned above at at least metric (matrix pass? 12th? Idk.) rest are graduated in professional field - medicine, accounting, engineering and everyone lives in a respected society and yet this bag of deepshit!!!

Now, now, as I said I don't have a caste certificate, because my grandpa (dada) was too lazy to care about it. However, my nani got my 2 cousins registered and this blew up the family like fucking Tsar Bomba. My cousins didn't want any affiliation because we all are good in academics and we can pretty much afford the fees for general category. We (as in my cousins and I) think that it's just a disability certificate and that an entire generation hasn't used it (my mom and mamas didn't have it) so we won't use it either. Now, You would say that's good because, well we aren't being asshole, but my family literally wants us (the future gen.) to be one. Yet, these guys will criticize the ""free-loaders"" and your daily WhatsApp shitposting. If irony were indeed a person, it would have like shot itself fucking a billion times. Y U SO STUPID?

Now, as we (the new gen.) are hitting 20s, our parents are like do you like any guy/grill? Hope he/she isn't a bramhin. Don't bring us shame. While, the irony is that we all have family friends who are bramhin - that too Punekars (esp in VilleParle)!! My best friends right from school to college are bramhins. I didn't gave a fuck about it, but have to admit that bramhin make the best fucking amti in the whole universe. Take that mom!! We literraly grew up in a bramhin environment and never have I ever seen this kind of fucked up shit in ANY of my or my cousins' friends family. Like, seriously, bramhins - the ones I have met and grew up with - are the most liberal folks. YOu call them all the names, but they would alwyas stick by you and drown you in their best fucking amti with ghee. Very close knitted and very very open minded. 

Now, the guy I have been with is a bramhin and my mom knows this. She is too prude to ask me about him so she just checks my phone bill to see whom I call the most. 

OTOH, my man's mom has called me many times and we talk like 2-3 times a week, and damn she is a fucking marshmallow. I am gonna steal her if I don;t get to marry my man. She is like the most humble, yet funny mom anyone could ever have. She doesn't know shit about FB and as my man works and I am still pursuing masters, I help her with it and god, she is amazing! All his cousins and elder than us and some even have kids. I haven;t met all of them, but they too, do know about us and tease my man. Lol, he blushes more than I do :p Many of his cousins have married out of caste (I asked him out of curiosity once), but no one is really interested in gossips as long as they are happy. Only this one guy had 498A misused against him, so his clan has been a little susceptible since, but that's about it. Every lady cousin of his went to a even warm home and all his ""vahinis"" are super close and cool. Yes, they still live in a Wada. 20+ folks under one roof!! 

My parents have been separated since my birth. Later, she had a fling with this guy who abused me, but she didn;t care. I grew out of it thanks to my hostel counselor and later, this guy I met - fucking love him he is my best friend!

I am almost like a family member to his little family of three. But, my mom won;t say anything about it at all. It's like, she doesn;t care or it's breaking her heart to see me go away, whatever. his mom always ask me how was my days and we regularly chat (I am in mumbai and he and his family is in Pune). I even taught her Skype. This is like, the sunshine I want and on the other hand, my own folks are deep in the darkness like caste, shaming and shit.

Holy shit. It's 2016. Why do I even have to care about it? Aren;t we (my clan) educated? These folks will go on and on with their ultra right wing shit and India needs discipline (like dictator ship) and reservations should be abolished and shit and yet behave like living in 1600s mindset (whatever that means!).

Now, recently, my mom has got really passive aggressive about how being a women is about having family, children and stuff. 

To top it off, this is what she said when we had a talk about children.

I was telling how a painful past of a child fucks up the puberty ago/ teenage hood, to which she just said, it's the choice of parents to bring a child in this world. God has given me you so I get to choose what to do with you. To which I said, but a child is a human too, he has rights as well. To which she said, no. All children are gift of god and only parents will decide for them.  

NO. YOU HAVE SEX TO HAVE BABIES. HOLY SHIT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT WE ARE NOT HAVING THIS TALK????? 

Where do I go from here? I can't move out and she is like turning into some batshit fucking crazy person. She did everything on her own, bought a home, a car, raised me (in hostels though), manages all finances of her own and mine and now, she is hitting 50s and this shit has started. She goes like, now you'll be gone (married) and then who will look after her as she doens;t even have a son and shit like that. 

I am losing my shit. and this IS NOT a shitpost. 

**TL;DR** conflicts with mo as to different opinions.. things have changed, but mindset hasn't.. All of a sudden, caste and caste shaming is getting attention in family even though we were pretty much general category.",9_lol," You can't fix people like this. They may change over time on their own. But nothing you can do about this.

I have seen people who thought like this change. But that took close to a couple of decades. That's society changing around them and them changing with it.

What you can do is accept and acknowledge basic differences of principles with your family, and act on your convictions.  Man... After reading through that, I think your tldr would need another tldr to make any sense...😢😢

On topic, solution is really simple. See if 'your man' is up for it and get married. Moms will see your way after some time anyways. Wat if I told you wot? Where is you tldr?  Marry who you want to marry. Live the way you want to live. Be true to yourself. The people who love you will come to accept it. You don't need this drama.

Example of Unintended Consequences - IIM Selections [NP],21,376j2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/376j2w/example_of_unintended_consequences_iim_selections/,17,"I have been planning to write about this for some time now. I was associated with MBA preparation industry for a long time and wanted to write about how something good like RTI ended up spoiling the selection process at IIMs.

Background - Till few years ago, anyone could dream to be in IIMs, even if you have bad marks in school and college. Get a good percentile and if you show great acumen in the interviews, there is a good chance you will get selected. I know of people who scored ~50% in graduation and could get through top IIMs. 

Was the selection process subjective - Yes

Then RTIs came into picture and people started asking for details on selection and objectifying the criteria. I have to mention it here that that the authorities at IIMs have the pleasure of plenty. It is a rejection process than a selection process. So, rather than instituting a better process they added qualification criterion (e.g. Marks in Xth, XIIth, Grad etc) and only if you clear that, you get shortlisted for an interview. So now, in the past few years, students who have performed exceptionally well in academics throughout their life can only dare to apply to IIMs (no pun intended :p).

It is my personal view that when you are creating Business managers, curriculum marks are hardly an indicator. Skills like Relationships, People Management, Creativity, Street smartness are missing in the people who have been academic all their lives. They can be really great as number crunchers and a domain like Finance suits them well. 
Hence in the past few years, b-schools have been creating degree holders, not business managers.

So, I think there are 2 unintended consequences of this - 

1) RTI in spite of being a good tool, ended up making lot of deserving people miss the bus, of course helped by the laziness of the selection authorities.

2) The folks who are smart, are starting up.
",estranged_gnrs," True and true. I can never get even a call from IIM-A simply because I was stupid enough to go to a university where toppers get just 60-65% True!

Not only that, because of RTI many honest officials do not take well-calculated risks for public good because their judgement will be doubted if someone files an RTI. RTI's that we file to IIM's are the toughest. There are so many terms used like Composite Score, raw score, WAT, GD, PI, QA, DI, VA, LR etc. The Tamil Nadu board guys are laughing all the way to the IIMs these days, or so I heard.  Let's just talk about general category.
Earlier, when only CAT was used as a qualifying criteria, the standards got pushed up very high. 
Can you honestly say there is a difference in talent between a guy who scores 99 percentile, and the one who scores 99.2 percentile. 

I think not. That is why additional criteria were needed to help assess the quality of the candidate. Of course, there are a lot of positives and negatives of this process, but this is the process followed worldwide in most B schools, and India adopted. Some of the people with 50% are brilliant, no doubt, but they are few. It is a safer bet on someone with a history of high achievement. That history may be because of better opportunities, resources etc., im not going into that side of the debate.

The qualifying criteria you mentioned has more to do with IIMs being a govt. funded institute, than with RTI. If there was no clear cut quantifiable criteria, as with all other institutions, we will see political meddling in the selections too. All of lalu's and mulayam's family will be MBAs. 

It is harder to interfere in the interview process because of the randomness of the procedure, and the initial stage of selection which deters such a possibility. 

Thus, in the absence of an alternative procedure, technology, the said method is the best of the worst.
 > Till few years ago, anyone could dream to be in IIMs, even if you have bad marks in school and college. Get a good percentile and if you show great acumen in the interviews, there is a good chance you will get selected. 

That is true, I know a guy from my engineering college who repeated a year, but got selected for IIM-A straightaway in first attempt. Why is RTI to be blamed here? 

I believe its the lazyness of the selectors is to be blamed, if the RTI questions asked for details of selection process, they shouldn't have said its 90% and above, fing managers trying to get good metrics everywhere ;)

Markandey Katju thinks that India is heading towards a 'revolution'.,12,63reu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63reu2/markandey_katju_thinks_that_india_is_heading/,1,"""India is heading for a Revolution

India is inevitably heading for a revolution. Why do I say so ? Let me explain

India is potentially a highly developed country, but actually a poor and backward country.

It is potentially a highly developed country because it has two of the basic requirements to be a highly developed country, viz. a huge pool of technical talent, and immense natural resources.

This was not the position in 1947 when India became independent. The British policy was broadly to keep India backward, feudal and largely unindustrialized, so that Indian industry may not emerge as a big rival to British industry. So we were not permitted by our British rulers to set up a heavy industrial base, but were permitted only some light industries like textiles, plantations, etc which, too, for a long time were mainly under British ownership. So till 1947 we had very few industries and very few engineers

The position today in 2017 is very different. Today we have a heavy industrial base, and a huge pool of competent engineers, technicians, scientists, managers, etc. Our I.T. engineers are manning Silicon Valley in California, and American Universities are full of our our mathematics and science professors.

In addition, we have immense natural wealth. India is not a small country like England or Japan. It is almost a continent.

So we have all that is required to be a first rate modern, highly developed country, like North America or Europe.

And yet the reality is that we are an underdeveloped, poor country, with massive unemployment, malnourishment, lack of healthcare, good education, etc for our masses.

We can consider some facts :

1. the level of unemployment can be gathered from two facts (a) 1 crore ( 10 million ) youth are entering the Indian job market every year, but only 1.4 lac ( 140, 000 ) jobs are being created every year in the organized sector of the Indian economy. So where do the remaining 9.86 million youth go ? They become hawkers, street vendors, bouncers, criminals, the girls often become prostitutes, and many end up as suicides. In 2015 the U.P. govt. advertised 358 jobs of peons ( chaprasis, i.e. class 4 employees ) for which there were 23 lac ( 2.3 million ) applications. 250 of the applicants had Ph.D. degrees, 2500 were M.Sc., M.B.A. engineers, etc all begging for a [peon's job](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/phd-holders-among-23-lakh-applicants-for-peon-jobs-in-up/story-OqHzHbvo16gUN2DfTkfYlI.html). Something similar happened when police constable's jobs were advertised in Madhya Pradesh, and peon's jobs in West Bengal

2. 50% Indian children are malnourished., which is a situation far worse than in sub Saharan countries of Africa like Somalia. A [UNICEF](http://unicef.in/Story/1124/Nutrition) report says that one out every [three malnourished child in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition_in_India) is an [Indian child](https://www.savethechildren.in/resource-centre/articles/malnutrition-in-india-statistics-state-wise).

3. Poor people in India have hardly any access to healthcare. There are no doubt some excellent hospitals in big cities of India, but they are exorbitantly expensive. Poor patients simply cannot afford good doctors. AIIMS, ( All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, ) looks like a railway station, with thousands of people sitting there, and no one caring for them, unless one is rich or powerful.. So where do the poor people go when they fall sick ? They go to quacks. Quackery is rampant in India.

4. The govt. spends a huge amount of money on I.I.T.s and elite institutions like JNU, but hardly anything for primary schools in villages, where the foundation of knowledge is laid.

5. [57 individuals in India control 70% of India's wealth](http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-interviews-blog/57-billionaires-control-70-of-indias-wealth-india-is-second-most-unequal-economy-after-russia/)

6. Far from there being any 'vikas', the Indian economy is lying stagnant, with chances of genuine growth remote. Whatever 'growth there has been has only benefited a handful of crony capitalists, but not the Indian masses.

According to Mark Twain, there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. Statistics is such a wonderful thing that with its help one can manufacture any figure one wants, like a conjuror pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

The latest figures given by the government of India authorities claiming 7.9 percent growth in GDP in the last quarter is an excellent example, and reminds one of Lord Haw Haw (William Joyce), or the Nazi propaganda minister, Dr Goebbels, who kept proclaiming on radio to the German people right till the very end that Germany was winning the Second World War – when in fact it was losing.

According to this claim, the Indian economy is the fastest growing economy of the world, outstripping the growth in GDP of the Chinese economy, which grew by only 6.9 percent in the same period. Evidently, according to this figure, we are heading for an El Dorado some time in the future, and as Dr Pangloss would say (see Voltaire’s ‘Candide’ ), quoting the German philosopher Leibniz, this is the best of all possible worlds.
But a scrutiny of these figures throws up several doubts. Are the figures true or dressed up, like a Potemkin village? Also, assuming they are true, is this GDP growth benefiting the Indian masses, or only a handful of big businessmen?

Exports have fallen from $187.29 billion in the period April -October 2014, to $156.29 billion in the period April-October 2015, ie a drop of 17.6 percent. So if exports have fallen, and manufacturing has grown by 9 percent, as claimed by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, where have the increased quantity of goods manufactured been sold? In the home market?

But India is a poor country, with 80 percent people holding little purchasing power. And with the sharp escalation in food prices, real incomes have really gone down.

According to the statement of Raghuram Rajan, the RBI governor, most factories are running at 70 percent of their capacity, while in 2011-2012 they were running at 80 percent of their capacity. This apparently shows manufacturing decline, rather than growth. According to a Business Standard report, corporate profitability is below one percent on an average.

Bad loans by banks continue to mount. According to CARE, non-performing assets during July-September, 2015 stood at about Indian Rs3.37 lac crore, an increase of Indian Rs71,000 crore. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, the number of stalled projects – the bulk of them in the manufacturing and infrastructure sectors – went up. Small and medium enterprises are having a difficult time trying to survive. The real-estate sector, which provides a lot of jobs, is down in the dumps, with construction of new buildings going down, and the number of unsold homes going up.

An article by Andy Mukherjee published by Reuters states that the GDP growth of the Indian economy is one third a statistical mirage, and real GDP growth is more likely to be about 5 percent rather than 7.4 percent as claimed by the Indian authorities. Mukherjee says:

>“The illusion comes from a recent supposed improvement in the way India calculates its Gross Domestic Product. In theory, Indian authorities claim that Indian GDP is close to international standards. In practice it has become utterly unreliable.”

What is the real GDP growth of the Indian economy? [Breakingviews.com](https://www.breakingviews.com/) answered that question by looking at three indicators: corporate earnings, auto sales and imports of computer software (since retained earnings finance new investment projects, auto sales are a proxy for consumer demand while software imports reflect productivity gains). Mixing the three in a simple index suggests that growth in the most recent quarter was closer to 5 percent.

But let us assume that the 7.9 percent figure is correct. The further question that still remains is: is this GDP growth benefiting the Indian masses, or just a handful of big businessmen? Is the rich-poor divide growing? Dilip Shanghvi, Gautam Adani, Mukesh Ambani, Aziz Premji, Pallonji Mistry, etc are worth billions of dollars, while the majority of Indians are struggling to make both ends meet, as prices of food soar.

What has happened to the slogan ‘sab ka saath, sab ka vikas’? It seems it was only a ‘jumla’. The communal fire is being stoked up again in UP and elsewhere. When there is an economic crisis which the govt. cannot resolve, it resorts to fascist methods, as it happened in Germany and Italy with the rise to power of Hitler and Mussolini

India stands at 135th in human development out of the approximately 200 countries in the world. For more on [this](http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2014/jul/25/India-Ranks-135th-in-Human-Development-Index-639966.html)

To abolish all this, and raise the standard of living of our people – that must be the goal of all patriotic modern minded people--. we have to create a modern, highly industrialised country in which all our citizens are getting decent lives.
But what has this government done in this direction? The answer is: a big zero, and only jumlas and dramas.
The test of every government or system is one – and only one: is the standard of living of the masses rising under it or not? If not, the government or system is a failure. From this standpoint (and it is the only correct standpoint), the Modi government, like the previous Manmohan Singh govt., is a total failure on all fronts
The question naturally arises that when we have all that is required to be a first rate highly developed country, why is India still poor and backward ?
The answer is that apart from the two requirements to become a highly developed country mentioned above, viz. a huge pool of technical talent, and huge natural resources, there is also a third requirement, which unfortunately we do not have, and that is a modern minded, patriotic political leadership. Let me explain this in some detail.
India borrowed the parliamentary system of democracy from England, and incorporated it into our Constitution. Now parliamentary democracy is based on majority vote, but the truth is that the vast majority of people in India are intellectually very backward, their minds full of casteism, communalism and superstitions. So when most indians go to vote they do not see the merit of the candidate, whether he is a good man or bad, educated or not, etc, but only see the candidate's caste or religion ( or the party representing a caste or religion ). That is why there are so many people with criminal antecedents in our legislatures.

Our cunning politicians take advantage of this, and have learnt the skill of manipulating caste and religious vote banks.

The interest of the nation is to rapidly modernize, for which it is necessary to destroy feudal forces like casteism and communalism. On the other hand, the interest of our politicians is to win the next elections, and for that they have to appeal to, and therefore perpetuate, casteism and communalism, which are feudal forces. Therefore the interest of our country, and the interest of our politicians are diametrically opposite to each other. How, then, can our country progress ?
Most of the Indian politicians are rogues, rascals, gundas, criminals, scoundrels, looters and gangsters. They have no genuine love for the country, but only seek power and pelf. They are shameless and incorrigible, and cannot be reformed. They are experts in manipulating caste and communal vote banks, and they polarize society by spreading caste and communal hatred. Don't such people deserve to be shot, like mad dogs, or like the aristocrats in the French Revolution who were guillotined?
It is thus obvious that parliamentary democracy is not suited to India. Our Constitution has exhausted itself, our 'democracy' has been hijacked by feudal minded people, and all our state institutions have become hollow and empty shells.

On the other hand, the socio-economic distress of our people keeps mounting.

I submit that the solutions to the massive problems of India lie outside the system, not within it. No amount of reforms will do, what is now required is a revolution. What form this revolution will take, and how much time, cannot be predicted, but what certainly can be predicted is that it is coming.
It is only after such a revolution, which will be led by some genuinely patriotic, modern minded persons, that a just social order will be created in India, in which our masses get decent lives, and a high standard of living.""

How do you deal with tough financial situations in family?,10,3bm6ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3bm6ik/how_do_you_deal_with_tough_financial_situations/,16,"I hate to discuss this but my family is fucked up in terms of finances. My dad owns one running business and holds properties across about 5-10 Cr, mostly farm lands. 

Elder brother is 33 and college-dropout, has 3 children and has been failing in both business and politics with constant record since past 14 years. He has started over 10 businesses over period of time, all after convincing/pressurizing my father to invest into it and he keeps failing. His failed business ventures have costed family at least 5 Cr loss over period of time. Dad pays for his daily expenses, including his 3 children and wife. Now you may think of kicking out such people out of house if you are young, but you have to understand it's no more practical. He has 3 little kids, and a wife who though supports him but inside regrets marrying this loser but can't even complain since this was their ahaa love-marriage. 

Now I do my little shit and keep my finances separate from them. But that does not help. Elder brother keeps taking money from me ( he's around 10 years elder). And in most cases I'm unable to refuse because I'm still not comfortable telling no to people ( you can call me yes-man), and if I don't give him, and expenses have to be met, so he'll only go to dad's business and take money. So this way sort of I help dad share the burden.

But now I've even started hating dad. He said I should take a FD in his bank because it offers better interest ( it didn't) but then he convinced me, it will help him show good will there and what not and his credit limited would be extended etc etc. Then yesterday was FD maturity day and I'm simply told my money was taken for some equipment at his business. NO FUCKING EXPLANATION and its told like I shouldn't mind it. I didn't react because I know I'm never seeing that money again. If I talk loud, I'll see a sad face as to how he is old and how he supports my elder brother's family etc etc.

Now I'm sitting here raging in anger. How do you guys deal such situations?? I know I should move out so please don't tell me that.",protos02," How could he cash your FD?  
 Chill bro. 

If you protest, you are not going to see a penny of that 5-10cr worth property. Your name would be removed from the will.  not a helping comment but just wanted to say that i sometimes feel i am to my elder brother what your elder brother is to you, a burden. my elder brother has done more than what my father has done for me, he keeps supporting me but i have a tendency to fail, i am a lazy coward, cant help it. for all he has done for me, i love him n can die for him. Am I having a deja vu? I have read this same story few months/years back. The only difference is that guy was earning way more than you. Are you the same guy? Are you me? Except for the dad running a business part, all of the above sounds like my situation

For your brothers, screw em. They've had their chances, and if they refuse to mend their ways, you cant do anything. You cant help anyone who doesnt want to help themselves

For your dad, its more difficult to abandon him, but have a discussion with him, open and honest about this shit. Tell him to retire and stop chasing the business illusion You need to build your finances if you are planning to get married and have kids. Time to have a frank discussion with your father. If your father doesn't understand, you have to move out. As for the property, if any of it belongs to your grandparents, you're entitled to 1/3 of the property. File a case and get it. As for your brother, you have to abandon him to his failures. r/india is congress mouth piece. The truth is you respect them too much and they don't respect you. It's common for people to have ideas like ""unconditional respect"" for their families, and in a lot of those cases their family consists of manipulative / inconsiderate people.

Based on your story, both your father and brother have turned out to be quite inconsiderate / selfish. They also seem to be deluded by the idea that because you are younger you automatically are subhuman compared to them, so they don't ask you for permission, and seem to want to tell you how to live your life. 

You can either have several unpleasant conversations with them (I suspect they aren't reasonable people to speak to), or you can continue being mistreated, or you can keep your distance. If the latter means moving out, then you need to move out. It isn't rocket science, but it's probably a difficult decision since it's natural to feel guilty. You should stand up for yourself, nobody is going to be standing up for you. 


 >Elder brother is 33 and college-dropout, has 3 children and has been failing in both business and politics with constant record since past 14 years.

FML. How did he manage to convince a girl to marry him? How much do you earn? Decent enough? 

I'd say just continue quietly, and explain to your father that you won't invest in an FD again because of the reason. Other than that, there is absolutely no point fighting the family over money. ",Business/Finance,2015-06-30 18:00:58

Please specify the context of your question to get a clarity I shall respond soon.  



  
1. In November 1994, printing of 1 rupee notes was terminated predominantly due to the prohibitive cost of printing. As far as this goes, why does RBI want to put them in circulation again?  


  
If you have any such question then let me know. Will soon update after the meet

EDIT : 
  
Proof that I met him : [Raghuram Rajan's Autograph](http://imgur.com/bE58vPc)

He didn't answer all the questions but some if which he did answered are jotted down 
 
**Regarding PSU Banks**   

He says that large banks i.e the big players didn't want to have regulators for small banks and wanted to avoid that. But He (R_R) believed that they stand an equal chance as them and deserved to compete in the market. They need to be given opportunity to create a business and shape-up the economy.   
He quoted saying "" If they can't compete then don't deserve to exist ""  

**Regarding Bitcoin**  

RBI didn't fail to understand bitcoin, it just alarmed people that its highly volatile. He was quite fascinated by the innovation of bitcoin but at the same time believes that they can't replace the currency as over-regulation might happen anytime with it and you can't control it.   
He cited the example of movie ' GURU ' of how he tried to regulate the business but ended up failing to decide the future of what he was doing.  

*""It's a good innovation and the direction is right but need something more stable, and BITCOIN isn't the answer""*
   
**Regarding how is his communication with FM,PM and other institutes**

He jokingly answer it by telling *'using phone, emails, fax and letter'* but then told that there were certain discontent between them while deciding on policies and public matters of which  some results of the meeting weren't what he wanted.  

**On GST**

Lesser people pay tax-logistics but he believes GST will allow more people to pay the tax and improve efficiency

**His Advice to Youngsters** 

*""Challenge yourself. Don't Do boring stuff. If its interesting, Learn it. Don't be a master in one thing, move to other challenges once you master one thing, that will help you remain down to earth.""*  

**Asked him when he plans to join Quora**   
His reply - *What's Quora?*

I can't right all the things he mentioned but some of them which I felt would give the gist of what he meant is mentioned. 

  
P.S : I ain't from Finance background, I am an engineer. So pardon my finance jargon or something which you didn't understand, please let me know; will try to rectify it for understanding

If the black money actually does come back, will it be converted into INR when it is repatriated, or will it come in CHF or USD? If so, will that add another $5-10B to the forex reserves?

2. How much forex are you planning on accumulating? $500B or more?

3. Do you think USD's reserve currency status will weaken a lot / little over time? As a *relatively* transparent EM currency, is INR likely to ever become the ""poor man's USD"" in its reserve currency status as people trade with India more?

4. Our inflation problems seem to be supply side led, and not monetary in nature. Do you ever see our inflation getting to a 2-4% long term, low vol range?

5. RBI (along with SEBI) has been talking for years about the need for structured / efficient corporate restructuring mechanisms. However, our CDR/BIFR are like the retarded younger brother version of Chapter 7/11. Why would you guys not implement some of these faster, and allow bastards like Subroto / Mallya / Gaur to get away with ass-fucking equity and debt holders alike, not to mention the customers!

6. How good is the communication between RBI, SEBI, ED, MoF? These organizations seem too siloed. You have publicly spoken about being anti FSLRC, which seems to be the right framework to many of us. What are you *really* guarding against?

Even 2-3 non-BS answers would be much appreciated.  I have one question,

Why do Indian PSU banks suffer from high NPA numbers (close to 5%) relative to loan book and the second related question, in spite of slow down in real estate why has the allocation to of credit to commercial real estate constant in the last 4 years.

you can look up here 
http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=33149

Basically since there is slow down in real estate the allocation to this sector should show decline due to inventory build up, but its not happening. I personally feel, banks are somehow financing the bubble in real estate market by still extending them credit. Did he imply that Modi government can potentially transform into Hitlersque regime?

Just kidding. He won't answer that question.  

Maybe ask him if he thinks the current low inflation is only a byproduct of falling commodity prices globally and not structural in nature?   How much does cia pay him? * Is RBI keeping a tab on private banks and their habit of giving out loans willy nilly, like property loans for properties that have no approvals from approving bodies, or loans on depreciating assets (auto loans) to those with bad credit history? if so how? NPA guidelines are there alright but how is that keeping them from doling out bad loans and accumulating bad debt? as a citizen, am concerned about all of these since I would be pissed if private sector banks have to be bailed out in India.  As far as he has been saying, he wasn't convinced that we had fought the entrenched inflation enough to lower down the interest rate to 7.75%. What does he think the government should do in the upcoming budget that should specifically ward off the entrenched inflation- be it food inflation or country's high susceptibility to global oil prices?

For the remaining funds, all depends on the Supreme Court ruling on whether MAT is to be applicable for non-domestic firms in light of the 2012 case it is hearing now.

If you admire rajan so much you should atleast know that he himself said that setting interest rates and inflation targets should not be in the hands of one person and should be a collective decision. http://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-very-happy-with-composition-of-monetary-policy-committee/articleshow/51372691.cms

2016-08-12. Professor Uday Shankar teaches this course at the Law School at IIT
Kharagpur.)_

Previous Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4xakjq/this_week_in_constitutional_law_i_part_i/

Link to Constitution of India: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India


Acronyms:
COI: Constitution of India
GOI: Government of India
UOI: Union of India


In the Friday class of last week we had an elaborate discussion on the what
constitutes a state under Article 12 under COI. As discussed in last post,
Article 12 says.


> In this Part, unless the context otherwise required, ""the State"" includes the
> Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of
> each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of
> India or under the control of the Government of India.

Last time we discussed how definition here is context dependent. You should
also notice that it say """"the State"" includes"", that means the definition is
not limited to the items provided in the list and it can be expanded depending
on the interpretation. The list is:

* The Government
* Parliament of India
* The legislature and Government of each of the States
* Local Authorities
* Other Authorities

Interpretation of government, parliament and legislature as they are defined
within the constitution and definition of local authorities is to be
interpreted with respect to to General Clauses Act 1897 as mentioned in Article
367 of COI. There are two things to notice here, first is that the list doesn't
mention Judiciary. Our professor mentioned that there is much debate about
interpreting judiciary as ""state"" in Article 12, but he didn't give much
details. The other thing is that ""Other Authorities"" is not defined and over
the course of time our courts have used this to expand the scope of fundamental
rights considerably by bringing more and institutions under scope of Part III
by interpreting them as ""Other Authorities"".

One of the first cases that raised that tried to interpret ""other authorities""
in Article 12 are _[University of Madras vs Shantha
Bai](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/233848/)_ which came to Madras High Court in
1954 and _[B W Devadas vs Karnataka Engineering
College](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1084632/)_ which came to Karnataka High
Court in 1963. To interpret these cases the court used the principle of
""ejusdem generis"" which says that a general word should be interpreted in the
light of specific words which it follows. For example if I say ""apple, banana,
orange, etc"", then pineapple can be interpreted as ""etc"" but not cricket bat.
In other words there should be common thread running between the specific words
and whatever we interpret as the general word.

In these cases the court said that all the specific authorities mentioned are
involved in discharging sovereign functions. Sovereign functions are functions
which can only be discharged by State and not by any private entity, for
example, managing foreign relations, levying taxes and maintain law and order.
Since the authorities in question are universities and since the function of
imparting education is not a sovereign function, universities cannot be
considered state under ""other authorities"".

The first case that came to supreme court in this regard is the case of
_[Rajasthan Electricity Board vs Mohan
Lal](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/459864/)_ in 1967. It was an employment
related issue where Mohan Lal claimed that the action of 
Board is unconstitutional under Article 14 (Equality before Law) and Article 16
(Equality of Opportunity in matters of public employment) of COI.

The Electricity Board, citied the principle of ""ejusdem genesis"" and said it
has been created to carry out commercial activity of distributing electricity,
which is not a governmental activity, hence it is not state under Article 12.
The court rejected the principle of ""ejusdem genesis"" and used the dictionary
meaning of the word ""Authority"". Court said:

_""[Authority is] ""a public administrative agency or corporation having quasi-
governmental powers and authorised to administer a revenue- producing public
enterprise."" ... The expression ""other authorities"" is wide enough to include
within it every authority created by a statute and functioning within the
territory of India, or under the control of the Government of India""_

Since Rajasthan Electricity Board was created through a statue it should
considered a state

Justice Shah gave the same judgement with a different reasoning, he said

_""The State Electricity Board has the power of promoting coordinated
development, generation supply and distribution of electricity and for that
purpose is invested by the State with extensive powers of control over
electricity undertakings, The power to make rule and regulations and to
administer the Act is in substance the sovereign power of the State delegated
to the Board.""_

In the subsequent case of _[Sukhdev vs Bhagat
Rao](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/426032/)_ Justice Matthew highlighted that
the function of the state is to provide welfare to the people and is not
limited to performing sovereign functions. The case involved three public
cooperations Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, the Life Insurance Corporation
and the Industrial Finance Corporation. He said that these corporates are
**instruments** of the state to carry out business of public importance.
Whatever is the method through which these corporates came about, creations of
corporates should not decrease the responsibility of state. Hence these should
be considered ""state"" under Article 12.

Not just for the economy of our country but also for us as individuals.  Personal finance, in very simple words, is the management of *your own* Monetary resources. . And although it may seem like a term that is thrown around a lot only recently, your parents and grandparents, etc have, in fact, practised it in some form too. For example: If you send money to your parents every month, that is a return on their investment in you. If you've seen your parents set aside a part of their money every month to pay for bills and fees, that is budgeting. In fact, all monetary decisions that they've taken in their lives, as a family, come under the subject matter of personal finance.


So, just like we try and focus on our physical, mental and spiritual health, focusing on developing our financial health is important too and hence, matters of personal finance and investing your time in understanding it is of significance to EVERYBODY who draws a salary or earns an income from a business/profession.


Although we, at /r/IndiaInvestments do try our best to address your queries on the matters of personal finance too, but [the person we have coming over](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/2l56m0/upcoming_ama_manish_chauhan_founder_of/) has been in the financial advisory business for quite a while and his blog and books are of quite a lot of repute for their resourcefulness to not just other financial advisers, but also for people who are trying to improve their personal financial health.


Now, **if you're wondering how you could capitalize on this AMA**, ask yourself if you've ever had any of the following questions in mind at some point of time in your life: 


* I (or somebody I know) have had bad experiences with the stock market, Or, I don't understand any of it so I'd rather stay away. What am I missing?



* I can see that a particular stock/scheme has been doing well for the past few months, should I go All-in?


* I have surplus savings. Should I repay my home loan or invest it elsewhere?


* Planning to quit my job and start out on my own, How do I decide if I can afford to quit?


* What is the best way to deal with the bonus that I just received?


* We are expecting a child and would like to see the child get the best kind of education. What can I do starting today towards that?


* I've always wanted to visit Japan, but ever since I started working, something or the other comes up and I barely have enough money to even think about it. What do I do?


* Mutual Fund ratings and stock broker recommendations. How much of these should I trust?


* I have bought an endowment/ULIP insurance plan recently. Can I feel confident that my family is secured?


* What is the difference between a Life Insurance policy, Health insurance policy and a Personal Accident cover? Do I need these?


* I just saw this advertisement about an IPO. All my friends are investing in it. Should I?


* I am an NRI. I hear that the interest rates on fixed deposits are upto 9%-10% in India. Should I send my money to invest in India?


* I am an NRI and I expect the rupee to get stronger. Should I convert all my savings now?


* It's tax declaration time and I am looking for tax savings product. What do I do?


* What happens if I don't file my Income Tax returns?


* A friend/relative of mine suggests that I put in money in a certain stock or scheme or business venture. What are the points that I need to keep in mind before I take a plunge?


* I have a CA friend who helps me file taxes every year. Do I still need a financial planner?


* Are financial planners only for the rich? 


* How do I evaluate a financial planner?


* A portion of my salary goes towards EPF, does that mean I'll have enough money when I retire?


* Besides extra penalty interest, what's the worse that can happen if I don't pay my credit card bills?


*Note: These questions are in no way comprehensive and will not be asked by us. These are instead aimed at activating that part of your mind that thinks about this stuff.*

Hey everyone, thanks for reading. The upcoming school year, I will travel to India (from the Netherlands) to study at Amrita University. The folks from the exchange office are really helpful and the process is going pretty smooth, but I still have some questions which I hoped (some of) you could help me answer.

I would like to know:
-How intensive/stressful is studying at Amrita (is there a difference between foreigners and Indians)?
-Which campus should I choose?
-How is campus life and how much free time will I have?

Of all the cities with campuses, I have only been to Bangalore (yet only briefly). I did not like the city very much, but I heard that it is the IT capital of India.

I am currently studying International Business and I want to follow mostly courses on finance when I go to Amrita. I have looked at a number of electives and I the finance courses quite appeal to me. Furthermore mathematics and technology greatly interest me. I would like to travel as much as possible and learning Hindi would be a priority for me.

Please share with me your experiences, tips, tricks and other things you think will be helpful.

Dude, you are in South India, you wont be learning Hindi.

Is it just me, or is this post triggering anyone else's Trollmeter? If you're totally looking for good education, then go for coimbatore campus. The campus is quite big and is situated in a very good location. 

If you're looking for education and some fun during weekend, Bangalore campus would be ideal. If this is still relevant, I did my CS undergrad from Amrita University, Bengaluru campus. I highly recommend you to join Coimbatore campus. ",Business/Finance,2016-02-23 20:00:24
Can we create Economy/Finance Filter on r/india?,5,30j3w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/30j3w0/can_we_create_economyfinance_filter_on_rindia/,8,"Politics seems to dominate, and that is fine.

DAE think Amartya Sen is playing a long game with his recent partisan comments?,0,1j9bdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1j9bdk/dae_think_amartya_sen_is_playing_a_long_game_with/,46,"Play along with me for a minute.

1. Sen has been making clearly partisan comments wherein he is kissing up to the Gandhi family, while spitting at those who are against the Gandhi family.

2. Sen knows that UPA is done for in the next elections. Which means, Pappu will go run behind his mummy's skirts after the trouncing in 2014.

3. Sen might be hoping that by 2019 or earlier, whichever government is in power, may be facing anti-incumbency. If it is a third-front banana republic govt, it will happen much earlier than 2019. Even if it is an NDA govt, Sen might be hoping that people will not like the Modi-brand of governance and there will be high anti-incumbency factor. High hopes, but everyone can dream!

4. So, Sen might see a possibility for UPA to come back in 2019 or earlier. But now, Pappu has not recovered from his 2014 trouncing. He, his mummy and other Congis have realized that Pappu's role is better relegated to the background where he has all the authority, and zero accountability. Exactly like his mummy. So, they have to find a slave PM who *appears* acceptable to Indians, which could be Chidambaram. Chidambaram could be for Pappu, what MMS is to Sonia. In that case, who will be the Finance Minister? Why? Our own Nobel laureate, of course.

**5. And who knows, a few more years down the line, once the trend of FMs becoming PMs has been well established by MMS and PC, Sen could also claim the PM's seat.**

Can't an economist with questionable economic theories dream? After all, other than being an economist, he has another crucial qualification that could make him a very acceptable PM candidate for Indians: a white-skinned foreign wife! Sen the economist and [his big banking family wife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Georgina_Rothschild) could continue with the looting of India, which has been going on for centuries now, almost unbroken. Except, Mr and Mrs Sen would bring a whole new level of sophistication to it, making Sonia-Rajiv-Quattrocchis look like amateur small timers. After all, Mrs Sen's family's bank has already managed to get a [fat 30+ crore-rupee fee](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/thomas-k-thomas/sbi-caps-keen-on-spectrum-auctioneer-job/article3704210.ece) from the UPA govt for one of the spectrum auction/sale. How many more such contracts could be in the pipe-line for that bank, [which is already expanding in India](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rothschild-india-to-start-ipo-advisory_510923.html), when Mr and Mrs Sen have the reins of highest power in the country?

Edit: Grammar, formatting, hyperlinks.",ychromosome," [deleted] The only problem with your theory is that Amartya Sen will be older than MMS is now. He is 79. By 2019 he will be in his mid eighties, and probably dead.  Its a little late for him to be playing the long game [OMG A ULTRA JINGOIST PSEUDO HINDU RIGHT WINGER SPOTTED](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1j95ob/how_i_feel_sometimes_on_rindia/) I'm... impressed by this comment of yours. Its tied together so well, insinuates so much, and doesn't even spend time on the ~~massive~~  *gargantuan* insinuation of wrong doing and malice on the part of Sen, and then just moves on straight to how his wife and him will Usher in an evil even worse than the UPA. 

It's a very well crafted theory. I particularly like how you point out that white skinned wive's confer cachet on potential candidates. 

Bravo. Now that he's done promoting his book in India, I don't think we'll hear as much from Sen. But he is Bharat ratna and also a nobel prize winner. He cannot be criticized.  Actually, seeing him so frequently up in the papers and TV, I was having similar thoughts, but the OP has brought it out really well and with a quite long view too. 
I would say, he has very reasonable benefits if there is a UPA3 (however bleak the possibility), maybe even a big seat then.",Business/Finance,2013-07-29 12:54:13
"What would Arvind Kejriwal, IRS have done?- Arun Jaitley",10,2uqpex,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2uqpex/what_would_arvind_kejriwal_irs_have_done_arun/,8,"Some disillusioned members of the AAP have taken up the case of the party’s dubious funding. The AAP is a brilliant propagandist. It claims to wear the label of honesty on its sleeves. It disclosed the names of a large number of corporate entities from whom it received donation by cheque. The disillusioned AAP members appear to have conducted a search of these with the Registrar of Companies. The search uncovered the curious character of the donor companies.


The companies do not do any business. They have no profits from any legitimate business. They are “Entry lending companies”. The functioning of these “entry lending companies” is very simple. At times there are a large number of inter-connected companies created through a multi layering process. Money is got transferred from one to another. The companies are registered at obscure addresses. The directors of these companies are unknown people, usually name lenders for a miniscule consideration. These directors are usually low paid employees of those behind the racket. These companies are used either for hawala payments or round tripping of their own funds. They convert cash into cheque.


Most of these ingredients are present in the case of the companies which are donors of AAP. Surely, when a company donates lakhs and crores to a political party, the party would attempt to know as to who the controlling interest behind these companies are? The only fact that the donations have been made by cheque does not purify the transaction. Withdrawal from Swiss bank accounts can also be made by cheques. Where a political party converts black money into white, its receipt would obviously be by cheque. That cannot wash away the sins of the convertor or the recipient since the entire transaction is fraudulent and a tax evasion exercise. Arvind Kejriwal is not a novice to India’s taxation laws. He is a former officer of the Indian Revenue Service. He knows very well that such transactions are dealt with under the Income Tax Act and not the Indian Penal Code. Why does he then dare the Finance Minister to arrest him? Is it only a bluff and bluster exercise? A company can donate a maximum of 7½ (seven and half) percent of its average net profit of the three preceding financial years to political party. Did the recipient Aam Aadmi Party verify this fact? Did it verify the controlling interest behind these companies? Can it even now tell us who was the individual who brought these donations and whether he had the financial resources to pay or was it a round tripping of its cash available?


If Kejriwal were still a Revenue Service officer and a case of such money conversion through sham companies resulting in donations to a political party had landed on his table, what he would have done? Would he have asked the assessee to write a letter to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India or allowed him to argue that a payment by cheque to political parties forgives all sins of black money conversion? Would he have arrested the fraudulent assessee under the Indian Penal Code rather than proceeding under the Income Tax Act? Surely Kejriwal is not a stranger to the tax laws. He knew what his party was doing. He should be honest enough to tell the people what “Arvind Kejriwal, IRS” would have done under these circumstances?",ownliner," > Arvind Kejriwal is not a novice to India’s taxation laws. He is a former officer of the Indian Revenue Service. He knows very well that such transactions are dealt with under the Income Tax Act and not the Indian Penal Code. Why does he then dare the Finance Minister to arrest him? Is it only a bluff and bluster exercise?

 This case so funny. A thief says he is ready to be investigated, but police won't do it. 

ayy lmao I don't get it. Did AAP and AK commit a crime under IT Act or IPC? If yes, then why don't you start an investigation. If no, then why are you bullshitting?  What should this chutiya finance minister do? Should he not order investigation into those shell companies? Why is he sitting on his ass? [The Joke's on you, Mr MCA](http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/the-joke-is-on-you-mr-mca-112103000032_1.html)

How will the Indian banking crisis end?,6,4l9vo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4l9vo7/how_will_the_indian_banking_crisis_end/,2,"SBI today reported that its GNPA has risen significantly. Other PSU banks are worse. Govt is talking about consolidating 20 odd PSU banks into 6, but is unwilling to bail them out totally with public money. How do you think this is going to unravel? Should Govt bail out the banks and thereby ensuring the job security of the employees? Or should the Govt let economics decide the fate (in which case there will be a need of massive down-sizing imo)?

You should know about Enron - the erstwhile energy giant who had invoked counter-guarantee to auction govt properties and whose bills were more than 60% of India's annual rural development budget.,11,3wcjxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3wcjxm/you_should_know_about_enron_the_erstwhile_energy/,2,"This text might be bit longer and I will do my best to annotate, bear with me please. This is another You should know thread inspired by the previous earlier you should know thread about Paranjoy Guha thakurta, Srinivas Reddy and Press Council of India. Since that was successful, let's see how it goes.

Let's start with a story, a tale that we might not know but we should know and be cautious (hopefully).

1) Enron, Houston based natural gas company,  now defunct, had had a sweetheart deal with our country. What is a sweetheart deal? [1]

2) Enron project was the first private power project in India. Congress ruled maharashtra state government entered into a **power purchase agreement** with Enron and a 695 megawatt power plant was signed in 1993. BJP and Shiv Sena -then in opposition - went all desi and filed legal proceedings against Enron and state govt. Next year, that was their only campaign issue.

3) Feb 1995 - BJP and Shiv Sena won the elections. They were righteous and **scrapped** the project. Mr. Advani - then leader of opposition in parliament - termed it as 'loot through liberalization'. He sort of accused Congress govt of taking a **695 crore bribe** from Enron. Enron said that it had paid millions of dollars for *educating* the politicians and bureaucrats, so that they understand the significance of the project.

4)  After the project was cancelled, US govt began to pressure the MH govt. [2] US ambassador Frank Wisner, deplored the cancellation. **It is purely coincidental that the day he completed his term as ambassador, he joined Enron as director.** [3]. 

5) November 1995 - BJP and Shiv Sena appointed a *re-negotiation* committee. 

6) May 1996 - Minority govt headed by BJP was sworn in as centre. It lasted for exactly 13 days before resigning to face a vote of no-confidence in Lok Sabha. On it's **last day at office**, despite of the no-confidence motion in progress, the cabinet met for a hurried lunch and re-ratified the national govt's counter-guarantee for the Enron project (which had become void since the earlier contract was cancelled). 

7) August 1996 - The MH govt singed a fresh contract with Enron. [4] 

8) The previous contract had involved annual payments to Enron of $340 million for phase 1 (695 MW) with phase 2 (2015 MW) being optional. The re-negotiated power purchase agreement made phase 2 mandatory and legally binding on MH State electricity board (MESB) to pay Enron a sum of **30 billion**.  It was the largest ever contract in Indian history. The gross profits were around $12 to $14 billion dollars. **The official return on equity was more than 30%, which was double of what is permissible under Indian law.** [5]

9) The increase of 18% of installed capacity caused MSEB to put 70% of it's revenue to be able to pay Enron. NOICE.

10) May 1997 - Supreme court refused to entertain an appeal against Enron. 

11) 2001 - Everything that was critiqued against the project, came back to haunt. The power produced was twice as expensive as the nearest competitor and seven times expensive of the cheapest electricity available in MH. [6]

12) May 2000 - MH Electricity regulatory committee ruled that as long as it was absolutely necessary, no power should be bought from Enron. The calculation was, it would be **cheaper to just pay Enron the mandatory fixed charges for the power plant which was legally binding than to actually buy and use the power produced from the plant.** The fixed charges was 1000 crore a year for phase 1 of the project. Phase 2 would have been nearly twice the size. 

13) January 2001 - MH govt - now with new Congress govt with new CM - announced it didn't have money to pay enron. [7]

14) 6th February, 2001 - Ten days after the earthquake in Gujarat, the country was reeling from the disaster. **Enron invoked the counter-guarantee that if govt didn't come up with cash, it be auctioning the govt properties pledged as collateral security in the contract.** [8] [9]

15) Enron and MH govt then entered into court battle, while then US ambassador, Richard Celeste, publicly chastised MH govt for not being able to pay Enron. [10]. BTW, Enron was President Bush's largest campaign donor. 

16) Five years later, This plant was taken over by Ratnagiri Gas and Power Private limited in July 2005.

[2] http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1011566556405983800 - **After presenting his credentials this summer, Ambassador Robert D. Blackwill wasted no time in warning the Indians that Enron's problems were at the top of the Bush administration's commercial agenda. ""I want to be frank,"" Mr. Blackwill told the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce and the Indo-American Society. ""These disputes have darkened India's investment climate.""**

[4] http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/10/business/enron-can-resume-big-indian-power-project.html - **Clearance by the national Government was the final hurdle for the stalled project 250 miles south of Bombay. Enron Development, a unit of the Enron Corporation of Houston, revised the project after the Maharashtra state government had canceled it last August. The renegotiated proposals for the plant were approved by Maharashtra authorities in January. But work at the site could not resume without fresh approval from New Delhi. ""Prime Minister Deve Gowda phoned the Chief Minister to say that the project has been cleared,"" Maharashtra's finance minister, Eknathrao Khadse, said.**

And if you are anti-national, the essay called **Power Politics by Arundhati Roy**.

I saw today's news that Cairn PLC is going to sue Indian govt for some 700 million dollars and decided to write this down.  Enron was a pioneer in accounting bullshitery. 
The only reason they lasted that long is because of the influence it had with the US administration. 

It had a nasty but perfectly legal habit of picking up ex US govt officials as its board members. 
The residuary  power and influence  of these officials were then used  to  ""guide"" the US policy on matters of it's interest.

This deal showcases their whole MO. ",Business/Finance,2015-12-11 15:55:56
[p] India in few years. A possible scenario?,0,2vfd9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2vfd9w/p_india_in_few_years_a_possible_scenario/,18,"So BJP is scared , very scared seeing what just happened at Delhi elections. BJP 's vote share hasn't changed since last elections . Other votebank got consolidated ( mainly lower class and a particular community shifted towards AAP)

Lower class voted for AAP because freebies . 

Particular community voted for AAP because AAP was the only party which was capable to stop BJP from making a goverment.

In short It is a mandate against development and wealth creation.

Scary thing is this phenomena  can be replicated in various parts of country

In order to win in 2019 BJP will do following 

1-  Will stop development agenda and reforms

2-  Bring many  populist schemes in coming years

3-  Consolidate Hindu votes because a particular community never votes for it , no matter what . This will lead to appeal for hindutava for consolidation.

While doing above 3 things, following will the result.

1- Fiscal deficit will go to a toss because government will borrow more to finance the populist scheme.

2- Very little resources will be spent on infrastructure, defense, education 

3- FDI will get reduced because no infrastructure, no incentives .

4- Corp-Tax will be increased to finance the freebies which will hurt the competitiveness of business in global market.

5- EXport will get reduced because our industry won't be able to compete with China.

6- Import will get increased 

7 - Rupee will have a free fall

8-  Balance of Payment crisis.

9-  Oil price might be recovering and reaching $ 100/bl

10- India will become a defaulter country .

11-India's reserve oil will get over in 2-3 weeks.

12- China will attack seeing our vulnerability
 
",pyar_ka_pujari," Aap won by a clear mandate not because of freebies but because for  the 49 days.. 

Even middle and upper classes voted for aap for anti corruption, women safety..  Rather than debating the issue, krantikari bandhus are down voting it. 

Anyways, the reports are that RSS did the internal sabotage for BJP as it is not happy with Modi-Shah who are not paying a heed to Hindutva agenda. Even the NDTV showed from Krishna Nagar that RSS had asked its guys not to work one and half months ago and that is why Modi-Shah had to bring in Bedi.


Without RSS, BJP is fucked, this is what has come to front.  > 12- China will attack seeing our vulnerability

You're a fucking PLA spy. And that time we all can call Delhi people of today, assholes.  India in a few years - http://i.imgur.com/x77JhXc.jpg

I just have 1 question - should I kill myself today or should I wait till tomorrow morning?

Why D.Subbarao was a far better RBI governor than R.Rajan.,12,2z7jxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2z7jxj/why_dsubbarao_was_a_far_better_rbi_governor_than/,4,"I work in finance and everyone here was surprised by the rate cuts from the RBI. There is a clear belief Rajan wilted under pressure from the Modi government which was under pressure from an over leveraged corporate sector , and PSU banks showing worsening balance sheets.

Data clearly shows that inflation slowed down due to slowing production. Therefore any pickup in consumption (demand) in short term would lead to inflation. In fact the governor said the same thing that he is wary in the short term of inflation picking up.

Also most us believed that crude was oversold and the governor was too bearish in factoring in crude prices vis a vie future inflation.

I'm not even going to talk about the moral hazard about the revolving door between large corporations  and Modi.

http://www.firstpost.com/business/did-raghuram-rajan-cut-rates-too-early-imfs-inflation-warning-seems-to-suggest-so-2155713.html


On the other hand Subbarao for years stood against the constant pressure of rate cuts from the UPA. I think we underestimate how good he was and certainly a far better governor than Rajan.
",Hellonaaam," Perhaps the pressure from Modi govt. is more threatening than that of from UPA govt. :P >Data clearly shows that inflation slowed down due to slowing production.

Production would have slowed due to lack of demand. The pickup in demand in isolation, theoretically will not cause inflation, especially in this case as the supply side is not under pressure here. 

A demand pull will cause inflation only if supply side resources are under constraint. As you yourself stated that the production slowed, indicating spare capacity on the supply side. Agreed. Raghuram might be the cool bloke but subba was far more resilient. He successfully nurtured the economy in face of one of the worst economic crisis. Unfortunately the media seemed too besotted with rajan to give subba his due credit.",Business/Finance,2015-03-16 14:54:55
Please help me decide,2,3f45dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3f45dj/please_help_me_decide/,6,"Already posted in relationships but need some Indian prospective. 
Hello everyone. I am 28 years male and I have been married for 4 years now. I am from northern India from a small village. but I got married to Aussie girl who was 18 at time of marriage.My parents live in India while I am in Australia from 8 years. 
I am pouring my heart out please don't mind the Grammer or long post. 


 To start with it was very well. We got together love blossom she had bad childhood memories coz of divorce between her mum and dad and she never talked to her dad. she wanted to marry someone who would not leave her ever. I told about my cultures where marriages do last longer and since it was my 3rd gf and first serious one so we got married despite sharp reaction from her side and my family also worrying about society. However I told her that in 5 years  I do want to return back to India and settle permanently she agreed. We 2 didn't care about anyone got married  after few hiccups especially her father threaten to kill me and destroy the marriage.  she moved in she was 18 I was 24 at that time. I did got residency on basis of this relationship but i wasn't fooling or using her to get this thing. We did trip to India together with her mother and step father and friends in 2012  got married in big fat Indian wedding style. She loved the experience of India. We were happy things were great she started to learn cultures got job in Indian restaurant to have better understanding of India. My family love her and I m proud of her to this date

Problems started with I realising she was getting lazy when we came back after 1 month around this time period she wouldn't show much interest in cooking we were living in shared house I tool responility of financial aspect worked hard like most Indians do 6 days a week. I later find out she was going clubbing and meeting other guys while I was at work. She cheated on me that's what I feel when she hide things from me. I got upset but I wanted her and got carried away by tears and I saw from her view point that she is young and need adventure and teenage partying thing. I trusted her words and we moved to new place as I fought with my roommates regarding some other issues. I could only manage a old house which was close to my job although she wanted to move closer to her mum but due to 3 hours drive from my work every day we rejected the thought. 

In 2014 I got permanent residency we went to india again for my sisters marriage she was 6 months pregnant. This time also she enjoyed there getting loved by all my family and she is proud of my family we like to show her off and other people are jealous. 1month later on return I started missing my friends and family more. Tears in my mother's eyes and she wanting me not to leave have impact on me bit due to some financial issues I have to return. I had built a new house in the city. Had few investments and we wanted to run a business some day most likely bakery because my wife love to bake and or open a dance school some day. She did left school b4 wedding She wanted to be teacher I supported her and got her in college where she finished year 12.all this time I only worked so all financial department was mine. 

Her step father got diagnosed with parkisons disease in 2012 and in September 2014 she asked me it's better if she move to her mum so she could care her during pregnancy as it's closer to hospital and she can look after her step dad while mum works. I respected that and agreed. Now that's where problem started me working random shifts but agreed to see her every weekend. In between we had fights where I wanted her to move in with me and she used same excuse that she need to be there. 
In January she gave birth to beautiful daughter I was casual at work still I took 2 weeks off taking care of baby. After that she still stayed at mums didn't want to move in coz of unhygienic conditions in bathroom coz its old. 

I wanted to settle down but again she wanted house around her mother's side I got 6 days permanent job so I couldn't travel everyday from mum s house. We chose a land near my work and paid deposit. I worked whole night in morning she would visit once fortnight to go look at display houses There was issues with house designs and we resolved by adding what we both want. 

Now I wanted her to move in with me coz I can't travel every weekend either. And her step dad died. She always said she is staying away because of being caring him.  I was sharing house with two other guys and she isn't happy with condition of bathroom and cleanliness but mind u she never try to clean the house herself even her dishes and stuff I have to nag her and write a list so she could do which is what she used to do with her mum. She started to get depressed and went to psychologist regarding her step father passing grieving. She invited me too. Personally being raised in country where I haven't seen so much fuck given about these issues solved with help of psychologist. We went now I got big surprise she hardly told me this but in front of her psychologist she said she has been feeling small, useless and fat and ugly . she lost her friends after baby she is lonely and  Although she did gain lot of weight. Again I put few points in my defense and counter arguments like I m working my arse off while she is just spending while staying away from me. Then psychologist told us we need counselling which I didn't agree. I felt I did  sacrifices like she did too leaving friends and family for love to be together there are some cultural aspects which makes it harder in communicating what I meant and what she make of it. My jokes she doesn't find them funny. 



Fast forward in June she came over with promise she would stay permanent after I did some repairs to house but  stayed a week with baby then she had excuses that she booked appointments for baby and her driving lessons at mum s place so she want to go back. Despite my only hope that now we would stay together she wanted to go back again which pissed me off eneded up in fight she gone back. She has planned with her mum to go out long weekend on romantic place she wanted us to go and she would move in after this. I was very very excited so 4 of us our 6months baby me wife and her mom. She said she want me to forget everything and just make her feel happy for these two days. I didn't knew what was coming we hardly ever talked as she hinted me we could talk her moving with me after trip which was like no in my head. So whole mood was off during this trip. On last day she told me with 😢 tears that she won't be moving ever and she is breaking up with me. I expected her saying no to moving but breakup was big thing. Although in past I have said so many times to her to breakup while in anger and she would cry to that but I forget after fights and treated like it's normal. I m realising now how big of fool I was. 

She is changed now totally switched off no feelings for me she want me to visit see daughter once a week or have relationship with daughter only not her. My heart is bleeding I am feeling suicidal. Can't talk with my friends about this in detail not with my parents either. I am realising now I have not lived up to mark as husband and I should have listened and done things but finances and responsibilities of sisters marriage and other stuff put lot off stress on me. I have been depressed for ages. She is agreed to marriage counselling which is in two weeks. Her birthday is on 31st  I want to surprise her and see her while she visit her friends she doesn't want anything b4 counselling. I am agreed to move into new house although it's just 12months when our house will be ready. Ready to change shifts from night to Morning. 


So my issue now is I am confused 
I wasn't  a better husband now option is to be better father like she wants me to but without her in my life which I don't want to do. I want either whole family of us together or nothing 
Or to be better son cancel the land deal don't take huge loan and spend my life paying it off  and  I want to move to India some day she said she doesn't know if she will now. Also her mum and sister putting words in her ears and making her against me. 

I want to repair my mistakes show her that I do care and love her the way she wants. I fear our relationship will. Never be the same and she would always give me threats of I ever did or expect even normal things like food while I come from work or other expectations of she taking care of herself. now at this stage I need to be clear in one direction not to get confused or hanging between India and Australia or parents and friends or wife and kid. I would be much better if this would get clear. Please give some advice or thought as I don't have western thinking experience. I am trying to change myself to be better person. 


Tl;dr; should I stay or go back",Fixmyi," Dude, counseling. Marriage/psychological counseling. No one is to blame at, but you BOTH NEED counseling. Do not overthink. 

Wish you good luck. The problem with you is that you are too attached and emotional. Be it for your family in India or your spouse in Aus.

This brilliant excerpt from Catch-22 captures what is happening in India right now.,0,5il51f,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5il51f/this_brilliant_excerpt_from_catch22_captures_what/,0,"Set during WWII, this excerpt talks about a jealous Colonel Black setting up the  Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade to expose another character as a communist. 

When fellow administrative officers expressed astonishment at Colornel Cathcart’s choice of Major Major, Captain Black muttered that there was something funny going on. when they remarked that Major Major was somewhat odd, Captain Black announced that he was a Communist.

“They’re taking over everything,” he declared rebelliously. “Well, you fellows can stand around and let them if you want to, but I’m not going to. I’m going to do something about it. From now on I’m going to make every son of a bitch who comes to my intelligence tent sign a loyalty oath. And I’m not going to let that bastard Major Major sign one even if he wants to.”

Almost overnight the Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade was in full flower, and Captain Black was enraptured to discover himself spearheading it. He had really hit on something. All the enlisted men and officers on combat duty had to sign a loyalty oath to get their map cases from the intelligence tent, a second loyalty oath to receive their flak suits and parachutes from the parachute tent, a third loyalty oath for Lieutenant Balkington, the motor vehicle officer, to be allowed to ride from the squadron to the airfield in one of the trucks. Every time they turned around there was another loyalty oath to be signed. They signed a loyalty oath to get their pay from the finance officer, to obtain their PX supplies, to have their hair cut by the Italian barbers. To Captain Black, every officer who supported his Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade was a competitor, and he planned and plotted twenty-four hours a day to keep one step ahead. He would stand second to none in his devotion to country. When other officers had followed his urging and introduced loyalty oaths of their own, he went them one better by making every son of a bitch who came to his intelligence tent sign two loyalty oaths, then three, then four; then he introduced the pledge of allegiance, and after that “The Star-Spangled Banner,” one chorus, two choruses, three choruses, four choruses. Each time Captain Black forged ahead of his competitors, he swung upon them scornfully for their failure to follow his example. Each time they followed his example, he retreated with concern and racked his brain for some new stratagem that would enable him to turn upon them scornfully again.

Without realizing how it had come about, the combat men in the squadron discovered themselves dominated by the administrators appointed to serve them. They were bullied, insulted, harassed and shoved about all day long by one after the other. When they voiced objection, Captain Black replied that people who were loyal would not mind signing all the loyalty oaths they had to. To anyone who questioned the effectiveness of the loyalty oaths, he replied that people who really did owe allegiance to their country would be proud to pledge it as often as he forced them to. And to anyone who questioned the morality, he replied that “The Star-Spangled Banner” was the greatest piece of music ever composed. The more loyalty oaths a person signed, the more loyal he was; to Captain Black it was as simple as that, and he had Corporal Kolodny sign hundreds with his name each day so that he could always prove he was more loyal than anyone else.

“Of course, it’s up to you,” Captain Black pointed out. “Nobody’s trying to pressure you. But everyone else is making them sign loyalty oaths, and it’s going to look mighty funny to the F.B.I. if you are the only ones who don’t care enough about your country to sign loyalty oaths. If you want to get a bad reputation, that’s nobody’s business but your own. All we’re trying to do is help.”",banker_boy2,,Business/Finance,2016-12-16 08:14:41

Budget Priorities. Collect more and give less alms.

Mohan Guruswamy

Stripped of all the verbiage the main function of a government is to collect taxes. To do so effectively and successfully it must preserve order and stability; and ensure conditions to keep the economy growing. The more it grows the more revenues it collects and therefore how much it collects is the truest index of its success. The power of a nation is directly related to the revenues it realizes from its citizens. The United States is powerful because it collects almost $8800 per capita from its citizens. Those who predict the imminent rise of China and then India to the rarefied heights of being a global power do not seem to realize that China collects only $390 per capita and India only $110 per capita. I have particularly in mind one official in the Ministry of Finance who goes from meeting to meeting with a PowerPoint presentation of in a few years India will be a world power in a few decades giving rise to much self delusional optimism among the national elite. There is no doubt that the GDP’s of China and India will close in on that of the USA within the next three or four decades. But we will still be nowhere near the USA when it comes to that raw index of true power. How much money does the State have to spend?

A State has four main streams of collecting taxes. These are corporate and personal income taxes; and customs and excise duties. Every year as the budget proposals for the next year are being written there is a general clamor from Trade and Industry bodies like the CII, FICCI and Assocham pleading for a reduction of the rates of all these. While they package their pleas with what purports to be sound economic logic, the real logic is just that the fat cats want to get still fatter.

Of course taxes ought to be reasonable and balanced to give the State more money to spend without imposing a back breaking burden on its private and corporate citizens. To find this reason and fine balance is what good government is all about. Too high an incidence of taxation will not only encourage cheating on taxes but will make industry and commerce unprofitable and dis-incentivize individuals. There was a time in this country when personal income tax was as high as 98% for the highest slab. The consequence was that there were few honest people at the higher slabs. Cheating the State became a common practice. With the rates now much more sensible this is not so common. Ditto for customs and excise duties. The only outcome of the extortionate rate of taxes we used to have only a few decades ago is still seen in the continuing incidence of corruption in the tax collecting departments of the government. It is no wonder then that an IRS son-in-law is still a prize catch for many a family!

But are taxes still too high in India? Let’s take corporate taxes. The USA and Japan top the list with 40% and 40.69% respectively. Germany collects 38.36%, Italy 37.25% and Canada 36.10%. Among the G-20 countries only China imposes a smaller percentage than India. China’s rate is a flat 33% and India’s is 33.99%. China’s rate has been steady at 33% for the past five years while India’s has declined by almost 2%. As a matter of fact only India among the G-20 has been steadily reducing the incidence of corporate taxation. Despite this uncollected taxes are on the rise.
The government could have been richer by a gargantuan Rs.5.8 lakh crore if the IT department had not been dragging its feet over recovering the amount in time or holding up files in appeal cases at the Commissioner of Income Tax level. Another Rs.2.1 lakh crore that is stuck in litigation cases at the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, high courts and the Supreme Court. The total figure is now over Rs.8 lakh crore.
These figures have been highlighted in the latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) tabled in Parliament. The report points out a tax demand for Rs.2.9 lakh crore remained uncollected at the end of March 31, 2011. ""The recovery mechanism is inefficient as certified demand remaining uncollected increased to Rs.1,06,990 crore (96.3 per cent) in 2010-11 from 26,703 crore (75.8 per cent) in 2006-07,"" the report adds.

Quite clearly this has more to do with the usual bad habits and bad government than high taxation? Meanwhile in the case of the USA the average corporate tax rate had risen by as high as 6%. Fighting two wars can be an expensive business. But so can modernizing a nation and fighting poverty by creating 12 million jobs a year.

In the details provided by Mr. Chidambaram in last years budget proposals is another gem. The effective tax rate for Public Sector companies was 23.35% while that of the Private Sector that CII and FICCI champion was just 19.50%. The IT sector has become the bellwether of Indian enterprise. The IT majors have been performing exceptionally not just in the stock market but also in the real world. They have been posting income gains and rising profits year after year. One would have thought that the self professedly socially conscious leaders of this sector would have given the State, which has also got to cater to hundreds of millions of people living well below an acceptable living standard, something for giving them large catchment area of math proficiency. On the other hand the IT sector took away Rs. 11,880 crores as deduction on export profits. The telecom sector is adding almost 12 million new subscribers each month now. It took Rs.6850 crores in exemption. And these are the sunrise sectors. I dread to imagine what the new day is going to be like then?

But what must cause the MoF even more concern is that China’s government revenues have been growing by almost 17% each year since 1998. And India’s has been growing relatively slowly at 12% in comparison. It’s true that their GDP has been growing faster than ours. But it is also true that they collect more taxes and give far lesser write-offs.

Mohan Guruswamy
",motherofmyfather," >Stripped of all the verbiage the main function of a government is to collect taxes. 

Fail.

The main function of a government is to ensure that the law (beginning with the constitution) is followed. Mr Guruswamy is stuck in the middle ages and appears to be talking about a Lord collecting rent from his serfs.

>The more it grows the more revenues it collects and therefore how much it collects is the truest index of its success.

False again.

In many situations, governments *reduce* tax collections so that citizens can have a greater disposable income. This disposable income can have a greater impact on economic growth.

>The United States is powerful because it collects almost $8800 per capita from its citizens. Those who predict the imminent rise of China and then India to the rarefied heights of being a global power do not seem to realize that China collects only $390 per capita and India only $110 per capita.

Fallacious argument.

1. The populations of India and China are roughly 4 times each the population of the United States. They don't need to match the US in per capita collection.

2. The author doesn't adjust for PPP.

3. The author doesn't consider the possibility of China or India evolving more efficient governance frameworks than the notorious bureaucracy of the US.

>A State has four main streams of collecting taxes. These are corporate and personal income taxes; and customs and excise duties.

Transaction taxes (tobin tax, Securities transaction tax, Currency transaction tax), VAT, service tax, etc.? The author leaves a lot out.

>Of course taxes ought to be reasonable and balanced to give the State more money to spend without imposing a back breaking burden on its private and corporate citizens. 

This is an assumption based on the author's political views. It is not necessary that this assumption holds in all or even most socio-economic conditions.

>But are taxes still too high in India? Let’s take corporate taxes. The USA and Japan top the list with 40% and 40.69% respectively. Germany collects 38.36%, Italy 37.25% and Canada 36.10%. Among the G-20 countries only China imposes a smaller percentage than India. China’s rate is a flat 33% and India’s is 33.99%. China’s rate has been steady at 33% for the past five years while India’s has declined by almost 2%. As a matter of fact only India among the G-20 has been steadily reducing the incidence of corporate taxation. Despite this uncollected taxes are on the rise.

The author needs to understand the difference between the marginal corporate tax rate and the effective tax rate. Check any MNC's annual report for effective tax rate. They're nearly half to one-third of the marginal rate.

Nani Palkhivala's India {Short read} [NP],2,3qjta7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3qjta7/nani_palkhivalas_india_short_read_np/,1,"Those of us who have lived through the earlier days of free India, when the entire nation as looking forward with zeal and fervour and with a sense of national pride, cannot but look upon the present times with deep anguish and distress. I do not think India in its entire history of 5,000 years has ever reached a lower level of degradation than it has reached now. The depth of decadence to which we have sunk was exemplified by the leakage of question papers for the Joint Entrance Examination 1997 for the first time in the history of the Indian Institute of Technology.
The only achievement of Indian democracy has been that it has survived unfractured for fifty years. Nine hundred fifty million people — more than the combined population of Africa and South America — live together as one political entity under conditions of freedom. Never before in history, and nowhere else in the world today, has one-sixth of the human race existed as a single free nation. Professor Rostow of Texas University regards the survival of Indian democracy as the most important phenomenon of the post-war era.

The achievement is all the more creditable, since no other democracy has had such diversity in unity, or was such a mosaic of humanity. All the great religions in the world have flourished in India. We have 15 major languages written in different alphabets and derived from different roots; and, for good measure, our people — whom you can never call taciturn — express themselves in 250 dialects.
The English language, which is not included in the 15 major languages listed in the Constitution, yet continues to be the only link language for the whole country; it is the only tongue in which the South is prepared to communicate with the North.
In 1950, we started as a Republic with inestimable advantages.
First, we had 5,000 years of civilisation behind us — a civilisation which had reached ‘the summit of human thought’ in the word of Ralph Waldo Emerson. We inherited great skills and many-splendoured intelligence, since the genes had evolved over five luminous millenia. We had a superb entrepreneurial spirit, honed over a century of obstacles. A few years ago, a World Bank report on India mentioned two very favourable factors — an unlimited reservoir of skilled labour, and abundance of capital available for investment in new projects. The trader’s instinct is innate in Indian genes. An Indian can buy from a Jew and sell to a Scot, and yet make a profit!

Secondly, whereas before 1858 India was never a united political entity, in that year the accident of British rule welded us into one country, one nation; and when Independence came, we had been in unified nationality for almost a century under one head of state.

Thirdly, our founding fathers, after two long years of laborious and painful toil, gave us a Constitution which a former Chief Justice of India rightly described as “sublime”.
The substance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations on December 10, 1948, is embodied as Fundamental Rights in our Constitution. The right to equality before the law is guaranteed to citizens and non-citizen alike. All religions are treated with equal tolerance and equal reverence. The religion of a citizen is no bar to his holding any office, however exalted, in politics or the judiciary. In this respect, we are more secular than the United Kingdom where a Roman Catholic cannot be the monarch or the lord chancellor.
In another respect, our Constitution may claim to be more progressive than that of the United States of America. Equality of the sexes is a guaranteed right in India, whereas the attempt to incorporate a similar right in the United States Constitution was met with resistance.

We can proudly say that our Constitution gave us a flying start and equipped us adequately to meet the challenges of the future. Unfortunately, over the years we dissipated every advantage we started with, like a compulsive gambler bent upon squandering an invaluable legacy. I am afraid, India today is only a caricature of the noble democracy which our forefathers strove to bring to life and freedom in 1947.

As early as January 1987, The Economist rightly remarked that socialism as practised in India has been a fraud. Our brand of socialism did not result in transfer of wealth from the rich to the poor but only from the honest rich to the dishonest rich.
We built up state-owned enterprises called the public sector in India. The sleeping sickness of socialism is now universally acknowledged, — but not officially in India. More than 240 public sector enterprises are run by the Union government, and more than 700 by the state governments. These public sector enterprises are the black holes, the money guzzlers, and they have been extracting an exorbitant price for India’s doctrinaire socialism.

There is a tidal wave of privatisation sweeping across the world from Bangladesh to Brazil, but it has turned aside in its course and passed India by.

The most persistent tendency in India has been to have too much government and too little administration; too many laws and too little justice; too many public servants and too little public service; too many controls and too little welfare.
My own thinking is that our greatest initial mistake was to start with adult franchise. No democracy has ever paid, all things considered, a heavier price for adult franchise than India. I am not aware of any great democracy which started as a republic on the basis of adult franchise: all of them started with a more restricted system and then graduated to adult franchise. When the Constituent Assembly was in session, two of our greatest statesmen — C Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel — recommended that we should not start with adult franchise but educate our people first to make them worthy of discharging their duties as citizens of a great democracy; but they were out-voted.

The second fatal mistake was to let the population nearly treble, in the absence of any sensible or sound family planning measures and policies. Today, the unbridled population growth, except in the state of Kerala, has been the ruin of this country.
Our third disastrous mistake was to pay no attention to education. Value-based education has never any sex appeal in Indian politics. Unlike Lee Kuan Yew who gave education the priority of priorities in Singapore, our political parties treated literacy as a matter of no consequence. The result has been that more than half of our population is literally illiterate. Official statistics give a more comforting figure; but that is only because any person who can write or sign his name is considered to be literate according to official statistics.

Professor Amartya Sen has bluntly said India will be the only country in the world to enter the 21st century with half her population illiterate, and that successive state governments have demonstrated “incredible irresponsibility” with regard to primary education. In total disregard of Article 45 of the Constitution, state governments have completely ignored their obligation to provide compulsory primary education.

When I was in the United States, I was often asked one question — How does India, with its great human potential and natural resources, manage to remain poor? The correct answer is very unflattering and hardly the type of answer which an ambassador of any country may be expected to give: We are not poor by nature but poor by policy. You would not be far wrong if you called India the world’s leading expert in the art of perpetuating poverty.

Yes, the potential of India is so great! Sir William Ryrie, the executive vice -president of the International Finance Corporation, expressed the view that India has some of “the most creative entrepreneurs . . . The most dynamic business leaders, and the sharpest financial brains in the world.” These words give you an idea of the magnitude of the effort needed to keep India impoverished.

Most of our politicians and bureaucrats, untainted by knowledge of development in the outside world, have no desire to search for genes of ideas which deserve to be called “a high-yielding variety of economics”. We are smugly reconciled to low yield from high ideals.

India is rattling — and rattling violently with spare human capacity. More than thirty million are registered on our 891 employment exchanges. According to objective estimates, there must be at least thirty million more who are unemployed, but who are not registered.

As the chancellor of the exchequer pointed out in the House of Commons some time ago, the population of Hong Kong is less than one per cent of India’s (0.7 per cent to be precise) and its land area is 0.03 per cent of India’s and yet it has twice the trade of India.

The picture that emerges is that of a great nation in a state of moral decay, of which corruption and indiscipline are two of the several facets. In the land of Mahatma Gandhi, violence is on the throne today. Mobocracy has too often displaced democracy. The contribution of modern India to sociology has been a Bandh — the closure of an entire city by militant rowdies.

One may apply to India the words used by the late Benigno Aquino about the Philippines — “Here is a land in which a few are spectacularly rich while the masses remain abjectly poor, where freedom and its blessings are a reality for a minority and an illusion for the many, a land consecrated to democracy but is a land of privilege and rank, a republic educated to equality but mired in an archaic system of caste.”

The greatest problem of India is that its finest men — men of calibre and vision, knowledge and character — are not in politics and stand little chance of getting elected, having regard to the murky atmosphere of our political life. I was one of the foolish people who told Hari Nanda to stand for Parliament. He stood for Parliament from the seat which was supposed to be the safest for him — Faridabad. He was not only defeated, but he forfeited his deposit!

If I am asked to name one curse which deserves to be regarded as the greatest curse of India, I would say it is casteism.

Unfortunately, divisiveness has become the Indian disease. Truly, divisiveness is the AIDS of India — a disease which is spreading fast and wide, preys on the public mind and is without a cure in sight. Communal hatred, linguistic fanaticism, regional fealty, and caste loyalty are gnawing at the vitals of the unity and integrity of the country. To the growing army of terrorists and professional hooligans, caste or clan, creed or tongue, is a sufficient ground to kill their fellow citizens.

National integration is born in the hearts of the citizens. When it dies there, no army, no government can save it. Inter-faith harmony and consciousness of the essential unity of all religions is the very heart of our national integration.

The soul of India aspires to integration and assimilation. Down the ages, Indian culture — a tremendous force of power and beauty — has been made richer and deeper as a result of absorbing what is best in outside influences and integrating those various influences to grace and enrich its own identity.
Yet, an objective overview would justify confidence in the long-term future of the country. A nation’s worth is not measured by its gross national product any more than an individual’s worth is measured by his bank account. Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith remarked that while he had seen poverty in many countries of the world, he found one unusual attribute among the poor of India — “There is richness is their poverty.”

Hundreds of millions, who have no standard of living, still have a standard of life. The ancient civilisation has survived and will survive when the raucous and fractious voices of today are lost in the silence of the centuries.

Nature has been kind to India in one respect. It has endowed the country with the gift of producing great leaders in the darkest hour — leaders with the gift of grace who can arouse the trusting millions to lofty heights.

I believe the solution for India is not to be found in adult franchise. There is a basic lesson of Indian history. Our people have always taken their moral standards from their rulers; the people have risen to great heights when they have basked in the glow of noble kings or leaders. The present generation is waiting for a leader who will make it relearn the moral values, and who will inculcate in the people as Gandhiji did, a sense of the responsibilities which fall on every citizen of a free society.
It is true that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. But it is true, in even a deeper sense, that eternal responsibility is also part of the price of liberty. Excessive authority, without liberty, is intolerable; but excessive liberty, without authority and without responsibility, soon becomes equally intolerable.

De Tocqueville made the profound observation that liberty cannot stand alone but must be paired with a companion virtue: liberty and morality; liberty and law; liberty and justice; liberty and the common good; liberty and civic responsibility.
One last thought, and I shall have done. Today, the unity and integrity of India seems to be at stake. But “even this shall pass away”. Indian society will, in course of time, acquire the requisite political culture — the attitudes and habits of tolerance, mutual respect and goodwill, which alone can make democracy workable.
The day will come when the 26 states of India will realise that in a profound sense they are culturally akin, ethnically identical, linguistically knit and historically related.

The major task before India today is to acquire a keener sense of national identity, to gain the wisdom to cherish its priceless heritage, and to create a cohesive society with the cement of Indian culture. We shall then celebrate our Republic as the dependence of the states upon one another, the dependence of our numerous communities upon one another, the dependence of the many castes and clans upon one another — in the sure knowledge that we are one nation.

[R] Goods and Services Tax,17,2ftrrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2ftrrf/r_goods_and_services_tax/,0,"Original date of rollout: April 1, 2010

Contentious issues:

1)

* States: Demand for provision in constitution to compensate them for any losses they make under proposed tax regime.

* Reason: Past bad experience of compensation in central sales tax (cst) case.

* Cst case - UPA government said that compensation to states on account of cut in cst to be released only when states agree to rollout gst. 

* Outcome - NDA said dues of Rs. 34,000 crore to be given to state over period of 3 years.
* Problem: compensation is proposed for only 5 years. ""the constitution cannot be changed every now and then"". Besides, NDA confident that states would not make any loss under the gst as they would get to share revenue.

* Solution: Use of alternative legal framework that does not involve constitutional amendment. Possible that 14th finance commission may recommend mechanism.

2)

* States: Petroleum product to be kept out of gst.

* Reason: It comprises 26% of their revenue.

* Problem: a) It forms major input for all other industries. 

* b) Will result in cascading of taxes for all other sectors, increase in cost of production. 

* c) It will disrupt audit trail and cause revenue leakages.

* Solution: a) Include petroleum in gst but tax at rate of 0%.
* b) States continue to levy sales tax, value added tax on it.
* c) Centre retains right to impose excise duty.

3)

* States: Entry tax to be kept out of gst.
 
* Problem: a) Excluding so many taxes from gst will defeat purpose of making India a common market.

* b) Pushes up the revenue-neutral rate for government.

* Solution: States could levy additional state gst - within a band - to protect revenue.

Need Advice. IT Calling but is it worthy career? Should I stop being that software guy?,0,1jrlbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1jrlbr/need_advice_it_calling_but_is_it_worthy_career/,7,"**Background**: 

I am a Computer Science Engineer and had a passion for coding. I have lived most of my life in a remote village, therefore I don't consider myself street smart like those metro kids. However I am competitively intelligent. 

**Confrontation:** 


I have worked for Infy for close to 4 years. 

Initial days were really good with lots of challenges and learnings. I had ample coding opportunities but with the new project, I was pushed to project management part which  I hated. Also, my salary stood at 4.5 LPA.

Frustrated and bored of monotony, I quit that job and perused MBA from top-20 B-School.


**Resolution?** 

Now, I am again recruited by an large IT company which promises to pay me 8.5 LPA and growth opportunities. Position offered is Business Analyst.

> 2) Can I switch industries after 2-3 years of trying?

&nbsp;
> 3) Should I run my own business (freelancer consulting) or work for large MNCs?

&nbsp;
> 4) Which sector has better possibilities? IT vs Sales/Marketing in FMCG vs Finance",digisolsom," If you love coding and dislike being a PM, you might dislike being a BA even more. But depends a lot on what exact tasks this particular BA position entails. BA positions can vary a lot in terms of actual tasks done.

If you want to continue being a tech expert, the farther you move into soft-skills based roles like PM and BA, the harder it will be for you to return back to the tech stream. Doesn't Infy have a tech stream for people who don't want to go into management? Why would they force you to be a PM?

Having said that, the (almost) doubling of salary is hard to pass up. Since you say it's an IT company, there might be opportunities for you to switch to other roles with the same higher pay, if you don't like the BA role. IMO, if you are stagnating or unhappy in your current position for 3 years or so, you should switch ASAP.

Why is this new company offering you a BA position? Is there anything in your skillset or expeirence that made them think you are well-suited for their BA role? Did you get all the info about this role (tasks, responsibilities, etc.) to see if it will fit you? 1. Given the profile and your comment about not being street smart, IT might be a good career choice. You need to really think about your strengths rather than the weaknesses and see if your career path is in line with your strengths. It is much easier to improve your strengths and the improvement in weaknesses is marginal as compared to your strengths.

2. Difficult in my opinion. You would have had around 7 years of experience in IT then and wouldn't make much sense to switch careers.

3. Your choice. It is dependent upon so many other personal factors.

4. It depends on where you see yourself after 5 - 10 years. Does your career path eventually includes becoming a CEO or get into top management of a company? Else, all the verticals should provide good opportunities. If you've a passion for coding, try entering a product company, find a niche in the technical area (career path leading upto Principal Architect/tech director).

MBA really is not much unless it help you to get into Product Management (and there is a serious dearth of people who have coding as well as business insights)


On a lighter note, hope is there http://www.rediff.com/getahead/slide-show/slide-show-1-career-how-she-bagged-a-job-at-ebay/20130805.htm From what I know, BA are the people who crunch the data and make reports which are circulated in the Board of directors. You typically are assigned to a domain/Geography. You gain expertise in that and soon in time you will get to be the domain expert, who will be called to provide feedback to development teams.

If you are technically inclined and want to write code, why don't you try applying for Product Management role? Product Manager is the middle man between external client and developers. He takes in requirements and see to that they are met in the final product. You can also write code.

For freelancing take a look at, [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1jmjri/hi_rindia_iama_freelancer_sw_developer_who_has/) 

Trying to switch industries is a very daunting task as you get more and more experienced. You won't be stopped but for senior positions you require relevant experience in the particular industry. So getting senior roles might be difficult. For Instance, I have been trying to move away from Server-Side development in java to, app development in python or mobile apps. I typically don't get good offer, because of relevant experience.

Finally, possibilities, I think is up to your tastes. I have seen people who do great in IT sales/pre-sales. People who are doing great in Finance as BA. So, it depends on where you want to be. If you like coding only BA might not be best job for you. It requires different skill set. 
But it is important to keep learning new skills soft skills etc.. You can take the job as a challenge and learn the new skills.. 

Once you have new skills you will start liking BA job also  Hey,

Why don't you post this query in pagalguy

However here is my advice, as per the info given by you

> Is IT consultation worthy career? What hopes a Business Analyst can have? What will be my career path?

I believe this offer of 8.5 L PA has come from an Indian IT organization. Think what are your priorities in personal life? Mostly the job will be stress free. You may or may not go overseas, IT is full of opportunities. So unidimensional career path with many opportunities as random as any other IT guy. 

> Can I switch industries after 2-3 years of trying?

Not if in your post MBA experience is in IT. You may try analytics & technical positions in e-commerce firms

> Should I run my own business (freelancer consulting) or work for large MNCs?

That needs balls and some time to get stable as freelancer. Since you already have 4 yrs of work ex,you would also be thinking about marriage and all. Depends if you can handle it. However I must tell you that getting a job off-campus is tough, in case your free kancing idea fails. You may try on part time ventures. You can take out time for those, I believe

>  Which sector has better possibilities? IT vs Sales/Marketing in FMCG vs Finance

What are your strengths? You will not get any FMCG Sales & marketing job with your profile. Campus recruitment in Finance jobs from your college will be mostly for operation profiles. You can go for them, if it suits you",Business/Finance,2013-08-06 05:09:54

2014 Elections & the case of Most Common Travel Agency Ever,0,22lc3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/22lc3b/2014_elections_the_case_of_most_common_travel/,1,"note - the author of this article has full intentions of bein recognized by fiat, or, atleast, ambassador foundation. and get some grant to start an n.g.o.

In the city of timbaktu, during summers, a new travel agent announced the best summer holiday tour package ever. He promised best food, stay at top hotel property in the town, with world class services, complete sight seeing, free vehicle service, some surprise deals only for timbaktu people, with no extra or hidden charges. Adding to the glamour, all this with service tax waived off. 

As in any other city, timbaktu also had enough number of people, who were fed up of below average cheap deals provided by other travel agents, without realizing, that it was more about hotels not being able to manage big uneducated, indisciplined crowds at cheap rates, and not about quality of hotel staff alone. Not to forget, hotel staff was from timbaktu only. Moreover, our new agent, calling himself, ""The most common travel agency ever"", had declared that while all other travel agencies had secret deals with hotel owners, he had no such arrangements, and so, by saving on commissions, he will give them better services at half the rates, eventhough hotel owners had not reduced their rates.

So, that year, ""The most common travel agency ever"" had a vey good business, they managed to break record of getting highest sales figure in the opening year of any business. Looking at its success, to save their credit in the market, other agencies that had poor sales figures, decided to shift their customers to the new agency. So, in the end, ""The most common travel agency ever"" managed to become hotel property's most preferred and top priority agency, and so, the new agency, who had booked maximum number of rooms, became decision maker of the hotel property. According to hotel's rule book, that entire summer, hotel will be managed by ""The most common travel agency ever"", and they will be reponsible for operations of the hotel, profits and loss.

Now that ""the most common travel agency ever"" was on the management seat of hotel property, it was in their hands to provide all that they had promised. The only difference now was that they had to manage finance and economics of that hotel too, alongwith their guests - the people of timbaktu. As promised, they declared change in hotel tariffs and menu prices of restaurants, even increased number of free services provided by the hotel. They even used satyagrah weapons when hotel owners tried to use their veto power through security staff. Here, it is worth to mention that security staff of hotel was kept in the hands of hotel owners, because, this particular hotel was in the most sensitive zones of the area. And hotel owners did not want to play with security of property while trying to promote democratic way of management, where, customer with highest numbers of room booked, has a say in hotel management.

However, during those satyagrah days, guests from timbaktu faced many problems, but they thought it was for their good only, and, so, ignored.

Then one day, suddenly, ""The most common travel agency ever"" declared that there was a dispute betwin, hotel owners and the representatives of ""most common travel agency ever"" - who were on management seat. Suddenly, they decided to resign and leave from the position of hotel's management. According to hotel owners, they only had asked ""The most common travel agency ever"" to follow hotel processes, to ensure no glitch in service delivery to guests. After resigning, hotel owners rolled back all free services and tariff cuts.

People of timbaktu, who had come on tour with ""The most common travel agency ever"" to enjoy their vacations, were now at the helm of hotel owner - the same hotel owner that was declared as ""corrrupt agent"" by ""The most common travel agency ever"". somehow, they managed to spend their time till the tour package deal ended, thinking, however bad hotel services are, they are atleast there to give services. people of timbaktu came back from summer tour safely somehow. Not to forget, ending up paying more then they had agreed.

There was no news of ""The most common travel agency ever"" till winters. However, during winters, there was news around the town, that ""The most common travel agency ever"" had started their branch in honolulu, which was a much bigger town, and promised 10 times more sales then timbaktu. there was also news that in honolulu, they had unearthed more ""secret deals betwin hotels and travel agents"". somehow, ""The most common travel agency ever"" had managed to maintain their honest image. However, according to industry analysts, it was not by giving good deals, but by showing corrupt side of other travel agents. Worth mentioning here for the reader, it was heard that industry analysts were also in secret deal with hotel owners.

By next summers, ""The most common travel agency ever"" had branches across the continent. So, they thought it to be safe enough to come back to timbaktu. afterall, timbaktu was their launchpad.

However, in timbaktu, someone, still not able to forget how they were left alone, hangin in the middle of corrupt agents, managed to slap the owner of ""the most common travel agency ever"". He was heard shouting ""I know what you did last summer"" repeatedly, which was ignored by onlookers, as most of the onlookers were deaf, which was a coincidence, and considered to be natures way of balancing the existence of someone silent since last 10 summers.

Fearing to loose their credibility, industry analysts declared that the one who slapped the epitome of honesty was paid agent of corrupt hotel owners. However, for the owners of ""The most common travel agency ever"", this is a good chance to prove that people of timbaktu are not well behaved, and that was the reason for failure of that deal.

Meanwhile,
1. There is no effect on the business of hotel owners, as all travel agencies, new or old, are dependat on an economy that is highly affected by business of hotel owners. Not to forget, travel agencies, being middlemen, can at most, negotiate freebies for guests, but can not, and dare not, build and run hotels.
2. Timbaktu, and people around other cities in the continent, have considerble amount of people who believe that it is possible to force hotel owners to make a deal where hotels will be managed at loss. And that for timbaktu's existence hotel owners are inconsequential. Amount of such people is good enough for the new party to continue in future for long.
3. Some hotel owners, who are given certificates of honesty for taking no commissions have joined the new travel agency. To accomodate them, they have renamed it to, ""The most common travel agency ever pvt. Ltd.""
