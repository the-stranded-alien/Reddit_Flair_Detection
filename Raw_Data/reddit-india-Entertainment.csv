Sacred Games Season 2 Official Trailer,282,cax0xe,https://youtu.be/w-Xe8gLBc5I,81,,stinsonlegend," They have to give Nawaz a catchy line every season, don't they. That's clever. They're playing to the meme market. Who is that girl in the shower? Bhagwan ko maante ho Sab ki gaand maarega lekin sirf trivedi bachhega...... The production quality of this show is just amazing. I don't know where I have been but all I wanted was to fuck ass! :)

This will be a meme for sure. So all 15 th August plan cancelled !!! Post the K-wave, West had its golden era of TV which is still on-going.  
India sort of went in an interesting way post 80s. TV wasn't dominant but it wasn't small either. And then it become irrelevant and Bollywood just became too big.  

India has enough of a market to sustain TV market. It just needs a certain quality and that requires some examples which work and SG did that because it has roped in major stars.  
If other stars start doing it it will open up the sector. 

That is if everything does well. 
Movies are not improving, maybe TV shows is where quality might appear because of the platform dynamic, bad quality products rarely survive while due to the nature of Theater/Screen growth in India it means Movie Producers don't have to care about quality that much, they can just ride the underlying growth wave and with massive marketing make up enough money in 3 weeks and be gone.  

In TV shows, 2nd season or so doesn't happen if something is a dud. More competition fuels more quality, in principle. ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪ Vibhin vibhin shauk hain logo ko, kisi ko marni hai and kisi ko....

1. Create a channel with Tech Prefix.

2. Wear a blue Tshirt .

3. Give ur biased opinion/reviews and preach your thoughts while pretending to be unbiased.

4. While uploading videos do put a thumbnail with mouth wide open and don’t forget to add ? Sign .

5. Clickbait title is a must with lit 🔥 emoji .

Congrats Thanks ! Hey OP :)

Check out my content. I create content inspired by TedED. I hope you like it.

 [https://www.youtube.com/ButWhy](https://www.youtube.com/ButWhy) Education category is a vague term. 

Indian youtube channels in terms of academics (teaching the course materials like they are taught in class) are very good. Many students within India and even in other countries in Europe and USA rely on Tutorials uploaded by Indian channels. 

[Gate Lectures by Ravindra Babu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjC1hn78yZqTf0vdTC6wAQ) is the video Bible for any CS student.

[Neso Academy](https://www.youtube.com/user/nesoacademy) is another respected channel in Electronics field.

However, if you mean stuff like uploading 5-10 minute videos on one extremely specific topic with good animations like in Veritasium etc. I think it would take some time before we do that. Good animations aren't cheap and we have a ""Chalta hai"" attitude that would rather explain stuff on pen and paper or whiteboard rather than spending time on making stuff on computer. Indians are still less tech literate than an average American. I know a couple of really good ones I follow but in Tamil.

[Let's make engineering simple](https://www.youtube.com/user/premanand20081) - science stuff but it's in Tamil (pretty big channel this)

[Moving images](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Zq7Ce0wPYsBNOQNb3y76w) - film essays - content is in English and he analyses mostly south indian movies but he doesn't upload often enough. Cancur Hindustani bhau I guess you're talking about original content here. Not some other channel ripoff with Indian accent. I recommend navin https://www.youtube.com/user/nfornavin 
He makes cool stuff I like Sabin Mathew's *Learn Engineering* animation videos. Live History India

It's about film, there are some really cool video essays. Uploads are very rare though. Neso Academy is helping me get my degree lmao YouTubers aren't gems. The content on YouTube is at best sciolistic and at worst vapid. You're not gonna get a tenable grasp of a subject with a 30 minute video on YouTube. Try logging in the time you spend on YouTube for a month and compare it with the actual useful stuff you remember off of it. There is a huge disparity. Consuming YouTube content is not a salutary way to spend one's time. What YouTube gem are you producing? dude........ fucking chanchalani and bhadana shit make it to the trending...even if some indian michaelcstevens exists.. he wont even make it to 100k subs..fucking ambani pure desh me jio baat diya ki even unpadh are using youutbe ....just look at youtub trending page Cricket gossip programs are good: Cricket Diaries & What the Duck. > Can Indian youtube ever produce gems like Vsauce, Veritasium, Kurzgesagst, Adam Savage or minutephysics, Slow Mo guys 

Can we? Absolutely. Will we? Probably not. Why would anyone make any genuine content when you can just shit out clickbait crap or a bunch of low-effort videos roasting worse content creators or the worst of all, the stupid PUBG/Porn videos. It's just too easy to succeed at the Indian YouTube scene if you play dirty and target the general population. There are many creative youtubers out there. Check this [serial killer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiYHudKJ8fM) video for example. Such talent and editing skills are rare to find. T-Bad 😤

Open letters are good for igniting discussion, but that's not going to lead to any concrete outcomes. Concrete outcomes are possible only through action. If you want to see intolerance in India going down, then please join us at r/GanjaMarch.

I believe that ganja legalization in India will reduce intolerance, lower our crime rates, lower suicide rates, improve mental health, lead to lesser sexual abuse and and reduce addiction rates of alcohol, tobacco and hard drugs. All these outcomes have been proven by post-legalization studies in the West already. These are also the reasons why our culture advocates moderate consumption of ganja, which we were doing till 1985.

And I think pre-1985 India was more tolerant and positive about us, our generation. But do we feel the same about the next generation?

Well, there is no way I can verify their claims, but it is highly possible that they are speaking the truth. 

We tend to think that the move stars are just like the characters they play. For example, we might think that Salman is like Bajrangi Bhaijan, Shah Rukh is like Rahul from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kareena is like the sweet girl that she plays in her movies and so on. 

But make no mistake. They are not. Stardom has gone to most of their heads and they are not to be blamed. We are. 

They are just actors. They are not scientists or innovators that are doing something for the benefit of society. Lets give our scientists and geniuses that stardom instead of these actors.",yourBaap," What you said is definitely true it's not limited to movie stars it's true for every other celebrities like athletes, singers etc. I don't think  worshipping will stop, but I think it's their attitude that will take them down.  [deleted] As a PhD student who really really loves doing science, I think it’s okay for entertainers to be more popular than scientists, engineers and doctors. It is dangerous for science to try to become too popular because most people do not read the fine lines and are mostly happy with half baked knowledge. Half baked scientific knowledge started the movements for anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers and climate change deniers...
People are not okay with the amount of self doubt and negative results scientists deal with in their experiments.
Also I can see the effect, popularity has on science. Everyone wants a publication in Nature and Science, making every group move towards novelty sacrificing reproducibility. You should lookup how many papers had to be retracted from such high impact journals because data was produced fraudulently (and how many more are still out there with questionable data).

Here’s my take on this. Pay as much attention as you want to movie stars, but always highlight that they are humans, and their persona is created by a team of specialists who are paid a lot of money. A good way to do that, I have found, is reminding people that they too take a dump in the morning and suffer from neck pain in the evening.
Also pay some attention to scientists when they appear on page 8 of the newspaper. Some of them are doing really interesting work. People question why there is no Nobel from xxx institutes. My counter is how many people do you know who won the Infosys award or Shanti Swarup award? Nobel prize is a different ball game that involves not just the scientists but also the projected might of a country. Ye bik gaya hai Bollywood. Sab milke hamko pagal bana rahe hai ...

Only Vidya Balan, Arshad Warsi, Raza Murad and Saumya Tandon refused to take money for political posts. Can someone explain to me why  Sanjay Dutt goes to jail for owning guns while Salman Khan is chilling despite killing a human being. It's a remnant of the post Independence era. Back in those days, movies were the only affordable source of entertainment and some movie makers felt the need to spread a social message through the movies since it had such a far reach. I think this is particularly true in South India where some actors were literally prayed as the gods they played on screen (NTR, MGR, Rajkumar etc). Some of those actors took up the social responsibility and wouldn't play certain roles in the fear that fans might emulate it and cause harm. 

That attitude has continued to this day, where some people identify the actors based on the characters they have played, leading to this weird glorification. Terrible human beings? Eh. Debatable. 

But this stardom culture is indeed absolute cancer. People care more about the guy acting than the movie itself!  I don’t get it either. 

I can wrap my mind around singer-songwriters achieving that level of adulation because the process of writing and performing music is deeply personal and you’re gaining an insight into an artist’s psyche, drawing parallels and deriving some kind of meaning out of it. Being inspired to write poetry, or pick up an instrument and evoke emotion out of it is a worthy skill and outlet.

I also get fandom around athletes - it essentially drills down to themes of discipline, endurance, skill, fitness, all things regular everyday people can aspire to emulate.

I totally get it if someone wants to emulate Tendulkar or Messi, Gulzar or Rahman, but modeling your own personality and mannerisms after Salman or Mahesh Babu I don’t understand.

This also ties into why desi musical.ly/TikTok is cancer. Also don't forget that while most of these fuckers pretend to be liberals and progressive in real life, the choice of movies they make and bear no sense of responsibility for it tells otherwise. For example, Ranveer Singh's movie Simba was a shit show of toxic masculinity and he's not even in a position that he has to do these kind of movies to make ends meet. Indian public considers the actor's personality to be the persobality of the character they play. The reason behind Amitabh bacchan's God status is the same as well. Start calling them Actors. They are not ""stars"" ffs.  I agree. You have no idea how people in Tamil Nadu here are obsessed with Vijay/Ajith, Rajini/Kamal, etc., it's just insane.  This applies to Hollywood stars too. Except, they have excellent PR and support structures like talk shows to build the artificial personality. These actors are just exaggerated image of ourselves. > A few friends of mine are in the movie industry and from them I have heard terrible things about these movie stars. 

You need to elaborate. Give us examples. Only read the title & I can't agree more on it. I believe empathy can allow for vicarious joy, and people who often don't have joy in their lives get it from fantasy. Bollywood provides that fantasy and people can find also some meaning in it. After all India is the land of idol-worship, and has been for thousands of years. Bollywood is simply the latest god creating engine. its universal, not an Indian specific phenomenon. Another reason why people like Kashyap etc will never get the praise they deserve.. nor will people like Raj kumar Rao and Irrfan Khan or Pankaj Trivedi .. so many names.

&#x200B;

Indian Bollywood demography is made of 98% people who like to escape the reality of life and forget the problems they see. Instead movies by these stars(Salman etc..) give them a way to escape. Its everything that a normal Indian man can dream of because lets be honest, the people who are living that dream are busy building it rather than being social media warriors or running a twitter fan account. The 2% who don't care, really dont care. They prefer art than fame. I agree with you point in general but.....

`Most, I repeat, most of them are pathetic, egoistic and are terrible human beings.` 

...don't you think this is too strong a opinion.....unless of course you were personally treated badly by most of them. I think you should talk about the terrible things your friends told you about. We probably respect them because we know those guys are filthly rich.

We respect rich people. It's something that's universal, and I don't know how the perception of people is gonna change. Everyone wants to be famous, and in process of getting famous, end up doing the same thing they criticized at one point of time. I mean, you like their movies , fine, don't fucking go all crazy about them. Set some goals in your life and by God, achieve them or die trying.

Peace out. I think media has a big role in this widespread popularity of these celebs. They chase them everywhere from gym to temple, write stories and gossips about em.  You can tell a lot about a person depending upon which actor he likes to watch on screen. It was different in the 1990s. 
Now a days, it's all about celebrity kids and launching them and KwK. Glamour has taken over and bulldozed movie making, story telling or even captivating the audience.
Lastly, Bollywood has run out of original ideas and music. 
I guess of all of the industries, the Bollywood is the least talented.  The movies get attention because people dont have have any hobbies except watching movies and listening music. Literally 80 percent of the city crowd spends their weekend watching some stupid movie. I'm interested to hear some incidents from you OP.
 So being a scientist is somehow better than being an actor? That is just flawed logic. I am not saying that we should worship film stars but what they do is as important as a scientist because they provide much needed entertainment. It'll be harder to live without either of them. Also, this supports the idea that no job is unimportant. Thanks for ranting this out, while many of us believe the same way as you do but we don't let this out because we still think it's not going to change what's on the minds of those who rate these celebrities/athletes/politicians/news reporters into super great human beings. Who to  blame for? The  reason behind everything is ultimately us - People of our country only. We spend our time and money to get entertained be it movies sports media, and we see it - we pay for it, they get rich they show you more, we see it more and we pay for it more - they get richer and richer. 

If a rich guy wears and lives a simpler life he will be considered simplistic and respected more. The same rich guy wears and lives lavish life he will obviously be seen as someone who is some God like figure who cannot be reached but only admired!  I only watch their movies for entertainment nothing more. Then they get into politics and continue being themselves, especially down south  If it isnt too much to ask, could you please share what your friends in the movie industry told you, I dont care if its verified or not but want to know more about these claims Holds true for film stars, politicians..and cricketers. And it's not a comment on whether any one batch is more deserving of such adulation or not.
Indians like to take the same emotionally charged route ..to fandom as well.

A politician surrounded by security, inaccessible is deemed respectable, strong; but when another chooses to be without security.. like an aam aadmi, gets slapped by an random idiot in public, ensuring status quo of the bloated egos.

Cricketers, or film stars idolized here can't enjoy a normal night out ever. So England with its subtle appreciation provides a semblance of normalcy. It's. a refreshing change of pace to watch test cricket in England, you get to experience the endangered expression that is clapping in a sporting arena. You can spot the odd Savile row clad gentleman taking a nap, which is such a contrast from anything one sees in an Indian arena. Again not a rating or statement of preference, just of difference. Virgin sounds like, hahahahaha. It seem he get so many breakups, because his girls realize that he wants to remain virgin. I don't see anything wrong with being a super fan of someone or a bunch of people, as along as it's not to ridiculous levels as some Indians tend to do. 

Like the Salman Khan thing, he ran over and killed someone but it's okay because he gives a lot to charity.. at least that's what I kept hearing whenever the topic came up. I agree with your thought that we should give that much respect to scientists,astrologer and many more genieus which help us to enhance toward more development and empowerment. ""They are just actors. They are not scientists or innovators that are doing something for the benefit of society. Lets give our scientists and geniuses that stardom instead of these actors.""

&#x200B;

Scientists and innovators can be assholes too. Bad people are there in every field. You are just recommending us to blindly glorify one group instead of another. 

Also, actors can contribute to society through art. I'm not saying all do, but many do.

&#x200B;

I think the bottom line is, stop with the generalizations ! Agree with you OP, except this malaise is not limited to stars - its the same across Sports, and ahem - politics. The myth of an all conquering superhero is one that provides us relief from the humdrum that is everyday life. Especially because the 'system' is always weighted against the common man. Its not possible for someone to have planned, determined success and be celebrated. It has to be superstardom. They only runs behind money. Movie stars, cricketers, politicians, rowdies/dons/.. all 4 get this GODly treatment. Bollywood is proof that an Indian invented 0! They should be fucked The malaise is not limited to India. Look at the Twitter following of Hollywood celebrities and socialites. Maybe it is a human psyche to treat this people like G*d One thing i know for sure is salman is not like bajrangi bhaijaan he is like Micheal De Santa They are upscale prostitutes.....the very definition of acting is pretending to be someone/something you are not. Why Salman Khan is so popular among fans. He is women silent killer, he is murderer and bad human being.  There are just way too many low iq people in india. Simply a matter of population size.  if you would have worked as hard as shahrukh did you would not be ranting here  It's adopted more in the south i think..  I'm just curious why you wrote GODs.

"Why does it feel that dancing, singing, acting/comedy are the only talents in this country?",64,b1urxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b1urxj/why_does_it_feel_that_dancing_singing/,16,"Every other Hindi and local language channel is either broadcasting some singing & dancing competition or there are men dressed up as women doing slapstick comedy/acting. And these channels mint a lot of money with these broadcasts. Sports media has at least evolved to bring badminton, *kabaddi*, etc. into mainstream where earlier only cricket ruled. I personally don't have anything against these forms of entertainment, however, it kind of feels like these are the only few talents left in a country of over a billion people. 

By identifying only a few selected fields as ""profitable"", are we failing to provide people with other talents the platform and support they require? For e.g. we all know where India stands at the Olympics medals tally. Had cricket not been so widely assumed the only ""profitable"" sport to invest in, don't you think India would have a larger Olympic medals count today?

Growing up we had programmes like quiz competitions, science exhibitions, educational debates, classical arts, etc. Now everything is either a singing or a dancing competition. Comedy too is just so loud with all the unnecessary canned laughter tracks. I am probably exaggerating this but is this just what we've become? Or are these programmes the result of what we've always been? A bunch of loud people consuming more and more noise everyday. 
",askquestionsdude," We love glamor and celebrity which is found in plenty on these shows so the popularity is obvious. I don't understand how people manage to sit through sheer vulgarity in comedy shows with their entite family watching.  I think it's similar in sports 

Cricket gets so much exposure from media and majority of kids are interested in becoming a cricketer.  You act like someone who does not interact with our countrymen :)

The audience is not refined/smart enough for anything else.

At best, we can have a contest where people show how much they hate other countries :) I've often asked myself the same question and haven't been able to find a convincing answer. Nothing against the dancing/singing shows per se but it sure would be nice if there were other talent searches on our tv channels. :)  
I remember forcing my son to watch Bournvita Quiz Contest every Sunday in 1996 on ZeeTV when we got the chance. It is a shame that the host, Derek, joined politics. It was a waste of talent.

It is good to see someone share the same opinion here...as Vishal Sikka said, we give too much importance to ""Nach Baliye"" than STEM fields.  


One of the reasons is that earlier, there used to be a collective national conscience to do something for the country. It was reflected in the national campaigns that Doordarshan ran courtesy of Piyush Pandey : Mile Sur Mera Tumhara was a perfect example which conveyed national integration based music. ""School chale hum"" was yet another example on radio when my kids were growing up at least passing on the message of development for all.  


I think over time, this collective conscience is somehow lost in the ether. Also, we stopped giving importance to people who had integrity and character and had a vision for the nation. APJ Abdul Kalam, Bhagat Singh, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, PV Narasimha Rao, Vajpayee....all their legacies are being forgotten by the people simply because they do not get the time for it : there is PUBG to be played nowadays.  


Instead of ranting, I would request all Redditors to provide a decent education for their children and to themselves so that they take steps towards nation building.  All over the world, the most common reality shows involve comedy, dancing, and singing. There really plenty of quiz shows that happen. They just moved them to news channels. Check out Tata crucible. talent is  something you earn money in india This is not an Indian phenomenon though, it's worldwide. And it's not really a question of intellect to be honest.

The thing is, with the advent of social media, it has becomee easier to aspire to become a celebrity-something that has acquired a lot of economic and cultural currency over the years. There is a shift towards more entertaining shows rather than 'quality-content', because quality content doesn't bring nearly half as much money as mindless entertainment does. Of course this can change, but it'll be decades before it does.

Also, popular culture has always been a site of contention and argument. Earlier it was 'why do people read so many cheap novels' and 'why do people sit for bawdy shakespearean theatrical performances' and so on. Every cultural moment has it's own background story and ideological reasons that look simple in retrospect but when you're living through them, they're just cause for annoyance. 

Someday, maybe. Till then, finding 'quality' content becomes a niche exercise that demands the effort that it deserves while mass media keeps pushing for content that might not have intellectual currency but makes a shit ton of money. I remember watching spelling bee contests on TV which Soha Ali Khan used to host.Would be pretty cool if we had shows like that on mainstream channels too There are plenty of quizzes, exhibitions and debates happening around, maybe more so than when we were growing up, you need to look at the right place.",Entertainment,2019-03-17 01:16:27

More serious and mature content is also catching up though, and if you look at the box office numbers, some of the bigger budget films with the bigger stars have not been doing as well as they'd like to.

For that I watched back to back violent gritty movies and tv series for inspiration from Chandni Bar, Slumdog Millionaire, Sacred Games, Peaky Blinders, Breaking Bad, Girl in Yellow Boots and so on. I saw documentaries regarding prostitution. somehow it took a toll on me (added to the fact that I had depression and few mental issues). I recently watched Zootopia and Secret Life of Pets on TV. It was purely accidental as I was browsing through channels. Watching it was really refreshing and improved my mood. I was surprised by how my body reacted to feel good movies after a long streak of violent gritty movies. I didn’t know how watching back to back dark movies affected me. I began to think what would be the status of people who have a bad life? People who actually lived or had similar difficult like similar to those movies? It is then I began thinking the other way. Not everyone has privileged life as we do. There are poor people and people with so many misfortunes in life and movies like Race 3 which has foreign locations, catchy songs etc makes them forget their life for 2 hours and so. Commercial cinema is maybe their only way to see foreign exotic locations. Why should they pay money and watch an Anurag Kashyap movie or movies like Slumdog or Chandni Bar? Their life is an Anurag Kashyap movie and they go back to that life once the movie ends. I love realism and I don’t watch movies like Race 3 but I do know for the fact that I am more privileged than many people. India has1.3 Billion people as a major portion of them have poor living conditions or misfortunes. They use movies as escapism. It’s easy for us to boast about our taste in movies because we were educated and had more access to resources. It’s easy to act intellectual behind a keyboard. 

Despite all these 2018 has shown that Bollywood can’t take the audience for granted. Hopefully it will bring some changes but Commercial cinemas will and should co exist with realistic movies.  [removed] Don't like it? Then don't watch it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Maybe stop judging what people enjoy and try pushing for changes in said movies. People always like larger than life entertainment or gossip drama. If you don't, don't watch them. There is plenty of choices. Choose something else to watch. Personally what I want to see in commercial flicks is better handling of female characters and representation of problems in not so tone-deaf way. I want Simmba to beat up goons but I also want him to take steps to make his city safer and punishing the criminals through the system, not take 'revenge'. I want Simmba to help the victims fight against the oppression, not met out 'vigilante justice'. These are the changes I want to see in commercial movies. But I genuinely find these movies as much fun as those that makes you really think or appreciate movies as an artform and I don't want there to be a day where either of these two kinds cease to exist. Isn't all Bollywood aimed at the tasteless, low IQ masses?

It's very difficult to watch most of the crap they make. Oh goddamn elitist moron. Get down of your high horse and listen to the masses. There is no need to reflect but there is a need to put aside your urban entitlement of shitting over everything which you deem unworthy of your cinematic taste. 

 Even the west has tons of reality TV like kardhasians, some ducking season, pawn stars.

Can't really help when the masses are crazy for the cheap low brow entertainment.  This kind of a mentality reeks of naivety and immaturity. I used to be like this too in my early teens.

The issue underlying all of this is ""class"". Films like Simmba, etc. aren't meant for us, it is as simple as that. It's meant for the working class to escape the misery and struggle in their lives. People like us watching and then shitting on these films only makes us assholes. What right do we have to call the media the other classes consume as ""dumb"" ""low IQ"" ""abominations"" (words that have been used in this thread)? These people's tastes and sensibilities aren't due to their conscious choices, it is something that they are born into. You and I would be the same - and enjoy the same kind of cinema - if we had the misfortune of being born into a lower socio-economic strata. 

This will get me lot of shit but, in a way, it is also fair to say that a film like Simmba is as good a film as Badhai Ho. While their scripts, etc, may be miles apart, they both have brought pleasure to an equal number of Indians, albeit from different sections of the society.

Drop this angsty, immature mindset. Rise above. Hoping ""to rid the world of these hideous monstrosities"" only makes you look like every other naive Indian kid on the internet. 

u/seppukuAsPerKeikaku also makes a good point in his comment.  There are good movies ..Ayushmann Khurana did double with Badhaai Ho and Andhadhund .. But to find gold one has to go through trash first. > we as intelligent human beings

That's where you are are wrong I guess :D Big Boss is a bit different because it's meant to be trash and enjoyed by a lot of people for it's trashiness. Basic Economics - Law of supply and demand.  You're the smart one dude. The rest of India is pretty stupid. That's why they watch that shit.  We intelligent human beings are a minority in India. Can do only as much in such a huge population of gullible stupids! > ""we as intelligent human beings""

that is where you got it all wrong my friend.

Try to accept who we TRULY are( not so intelligent human beings who like hideous monstrosities), you'd have lesser disappointments in life. kuch nahi chill maar aur so ja I'm very confused about this.

On one hand - yeah its a fair point that its entertainment. No industry owes it to us to make what we like. It's up to us to consume what we can.

But on the other hand, and this is in relation to the argument about dark shit vs masala stuff, that's not the argument. Tumhari Sulu wasn't dark. The old Golmaal wasn't dark. Badhaai ho wasn't dark. Stree was perfectly okay. They're still entertaining movies that everybody related too. Why should we be okay with absolute baseline mediocrity? But, well, filmmaking is expensive business and people pay for mediocrity. So, yeah. Race 2 is the greatest movie ever made. STFU Watch Jerry Springer? Because.. aankh maarey re ladka aankh maarey... PELVIC THRUST PELVIC THRUST SKIMPY CLOTHED THUMKA SHINY LIGHTS, DESIGNER CLOTHES, PELVIC THRUST SUGGESTIVE LYRICS.  It's not just here. Heard about Human Centepede? /r/iamverysmart As if phenomemon of mindless entertainment is specific to India. 

People enjoy them, let them. Does Big Boss on TV or Race 3 in theatres deny you your type of entertainment? India has a lot of dumb people. Hence Chutiya producers make Chutiya movies for Chutiya people.

Anyone else watched 'Made In Heaven' on Prime Video yet?,18,ayqi3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ayqi3h/anyone_else_watched_made_in_heaven_on_prime_video/,13,"I haven't completed it yet, but I think it's a really well done show, whatever my reservations. 

Looking for people to discuss it with. ",milkstatue," About to get done, but I can safely say this series is *the* best amongst whatever indian-made web series that have come out over the last two years. I'd rank this above Sacred Games and that had Nawazuddin Siddiqui in it. It's well shot, extremely well produced and just all around very entertaining to watch. I doubt there is anything else out there which better illustrates what gay people go through in this country on a daily basis.  Watched 2 episodes, everything looks very posh and high profile. Issues addressed so far:

1. Infidelity
2. Betrayal
3. Homosexuality
4. Patriarchy
5. Privacy

Its good drama, bit sleazy IMO. Will finish it this weekend.

PS: Was surprised to see directed by Zoya Akhtar, thought it was just her idea. Late to this discussion. But I really enjoyed the show. Friend of mine had to literally force me to watch the first episode but I was instantly hooked. I love how they use the backdrop of indian weddings to display the hypocrisy in our society. The expression of sunk cost fallacy in the wedding industry is perfectly highlighted. 

They also do a great job showing the stigma related to homosexuality. The friend who introduced it to me would cringe when they showed a gay sex scene . A lot of people would think that hiding your sexuality is simple and people should just be gay in private bit they really open your eyes to the difficulty associated with repressing your sexuality. 

They covered a lot in the first season itself but the story has a lot more to tie up in the next season. The dynamics between the characters is amazing and you can really see how they each have a point at which they break from their usual selves. Yeah. Rajeev Masand was saying that it's really good. Will watch it during Spring break SO GOOD

Obsessed with Karan's arc does anyone know anything about the xulfi song in episode 2. Very late to this thread, but I just saw it last week and was looking to discuss it as well. It was the kind of show that could easily have been over-dramatic and soap-y but the writing was so on point and the acting was beautifully understated so it was a joy to watch. Even the more predictable plot points were interesting because the characters were written so well. I'm interested to see where they'll take it next season. Does anyone know which wristwatch Arjun Mathur wears? It has a yellow face. I'm obsessed. Stupid series.

How about we don't watch TV at all.,49,am770c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/am770c/how_about_we_dont_watch_tv_at_all/,26,"I was going through r/india subreddit where I saw many posts regarding the new plan TRAI has proposed. And overall Channel cost being higher than previous scheme.

But what if we don't watch TV at all and encourage others  because We All Know They are selling propaganda afterall. Every channel has their own agenda.There is not a single quality '30 minute programme.' I might be exaggerating but I can say this for about 80% of TV.

I understand people still want to watch sports and news. We can watch these programs  online for a very low fees. 

These are my 2 cents on the situation about how we can tackle it.
I know my fellow redditors will have questions. I will try to answer their questions.
",UnhatchedEgg," \+1

It's for this reason I haven't watched a news show I think since the Nirbhay movement. Everything is measured by TRP and clicks, not by good outcomes for everyone.  Cut my cable back in Jan last year and got a Chromecast..its much better.. planning to get a mi box as it has more features While we ourselves may not watch Tv,  there are still millions whose only source of entertainment is the tv. 

My grandma would kill me if I take the tv away from her.  >I understand people still want to watch sports and news. We can watch these programs online for a very low fees.

Not everyone has access to unlimited high-speed internet. I live in a tier 2 city and I am finding it hard to give up on DTH and solely rely on the internet for streaming. Now think about those who are living in rural or remote areas or are not technologically savvy enough. It is not as easy as you are making it out.  6 years + here. Got feed up with mindless ads and 3rd class content. I do have all channels cause wife and mom. But me personally, I don't even know what to watch on TV lol. Used to be interested in news but there's nothing left there. 

So when I have absolutely nothing to do and I am tired of Netflix, YouTube, amazon prime, reddit... I turn on the TV, keep changing the channels for about 2 minutes and turn it off  Stopped watching. The most peaceful 1.5 yrs. Cable connection in my home is just for my grandma's shows. Okay some are saying they use Cable only because of their families. That's alright in my opinion. 
But atleast we can encourage our generation and younger generation who think they've got no other source of entertainment. Had been more than a year that I got rid of TV... Don't even own one now...have got so much free time now that I spend on improving myself. Where can we watch sports online for low fee? Amazon Prime Video ₹999

Hotstar Annual Sub    ₹999

Netflix(4 Person)         ₹200

SonyLiv                          Free

Much better than any cable pack you might subscribe to.  I haven't had a cable connection since 2014. Never missed it for a minute  I don't watch TV at all since school days. We were in boarding school and had no tv. College days there was no time. These days whole of the entertainment is online. I made the mistake of opening tv few times, what a bunch of crap that passes for a news, tv serial, reality shows etc, utter crap. The crap that we have on Indian tv will fall flat in front of any cable content from other countries. About time they think through how to make serials, news , reality shows, etc because newer generation of people simply aren't interested in watching TV at all. It's all about internet. Simple YouTube channels and news articles on the internet have better content than big media houses. And then comes these Netflix, Amazon prime, hulu type services that produces awesome content that people actually pay to see and can see it anytime any episode anywhere.  Wish I could tell this to my parents but TV is the only thing they have for entertainment so I really don't wanna screw with that [removed] [removed] I dont even watch TV since 3-4 years.Its my grandparents who are TV fanatics. Someone please explain that to my mum and dad who keep the effing TV and that set-top-box for absolutely no reason. Redditors please put forth your points to aid me I haven't watched actual TV in over 15 years.. ever since I left home for college. Couldn't really watch in college, and after I left college, I stuck to movies and TV shows from the internet. 

I tried watching a few times but was astounded by the sheer number of ads. Also, the fact that you have essentially a very limited choice at any given moment, and you have to wait for the show you want is too bad. I'm surprised TV has lasted so long. Maybe it's there for the older people and for news and sports. ",Entertainment,2019-02-02 05:45:37
Should R Ashwin be banned?,0,b5dwwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b5dwwx/should_r_ashwin_be_banned/,24,"R ashwin, Captain of RR in the currently ongoing IPL 2019 mankaded Jo Butler. Basically before delivering the ball, he stopped to see that the batsman at the non striking end (Butler) was out of crease. R ashwin then proceeded to run out Butler. 

Mankading isn't illegal (not confirmed) in Cricket. But this move is surely shameful. Most of the viewers are shaming him and saying that he should be banned. What do you guys think?

Edit - If a cricket scholar can advise whether mankading is legal or illegal that'd be great.",Amanbbi," Banning some player should be backed by a reason since you only said the mankading isn't illegal then how can you ban a player without any reason? >R Ashwin. Captain of RR.   

Bhai kya phoonk rakha hai? Just look at it at the point of view from a bowler. 

Batsmen are now allowed to shape their bats according to their requirements . The game has become such batsmen friendly that bowlers are looking for new ways to counter that. On top of that batsmen are now leaving the crease early to run an extra run or two. Bowlers literally are out of options and Mankading which is not at all illegal is seen as an option by several bowlers these days.  No one wants to see logical arguments here.. 

1) you are not allowed to leave the crease before ball is bowled. 

2) if bowler has not loaded his action then he can run the batsman out. 

These 2 rules should be sufficient but I guess people mixing ethics,  sportsmanship with rules. 

Understand..  backing up before ball is bowled is also unethical.  Lol..its a good entertainment in an entertainment circus.  <<Isn't illegal >>

So why ban ?

I am not a cricket fan but if something isn't illegal than there is nothing wrong. If you see the clip, ashwin was waiting for Butler to go out. Deceiving is same as cheating *Jos Buttler Neither BCCI nor ICC can make laws. That is the prerogative of the government, which has no business meddling with cricket rules. Hence, the question of legality is ill posed.  Okay Ashwin was cunt for appealing but the third umpire should've known better because it was referred to him.  Mankading is legal and allowed. However there is something called the spirit of the game. Mankading without any warning is a cunt move, very unsportsmanlike but legal.           



For Ashwin, it is more complicated because if you look at the video from various angles in slo-mo, you can see had he bowled  normally, then at the time ball would leave the hand, Butler would still be in his crease. Ashwin slowed down and waited for Butler to leave the crease to run him out. That makes it a dubious case.              



Banning him is way too harsh. Maybe a fine, maybe. But it was a dick move and he should be ashamed to resort to such tactics because they couldn't get Butler out the normal way. What he did is shameful and totally against the spirit of the game, I wouldn't want him in my team. Banning ashwin means attack against Tamils Its legal.

But you cannot just stop at the point of delivery and wait for the batsman to get out of the crease. This is where Ashwin should be ashamed of himself. 

When Harsha asked him in presentation , if he waited for the batsman to get out ? He replied "" I was not even in the delivery stride. And it was instinctive.""

How much bandwidth (mbps) and total data capacity (GB/s per day) do I need to use smart boxes like Amazon Fire Stick in India?,20,apon1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/apon1b/how_much_bandwidth_mbps_and_total_data_capacity/,22,"I've shifted to my new home and instead of getting the local cable TV, I'm thinking of getting an Android HDMI Box (Fire Stick or one of the others). Only two things I want to know:

1. What speed (mpbs) do I need to watch streaming apps like SonyLiv, Zee, etc. at least in SD (Standard Display)?
2. How much total data will be used (like 1.5GB per day)?

For example, if I get a Jio 1.5GB per day plan, will it be sufficient to stream for about 4-5 hours a day?",the_php_coder," [removed] I dont have fire stick but I use Mi Box which is like chromecast.

We use 256+ GB per month. No cable connection. Here's a rough guideline to use on top of the hourly data usage estimate for HD/SD Netflix and Amazon Prime per device.   
1. Number of concurrent Internet streaming users at your house (more = you need higher bandwidth; alone = you can go for a lower bandwidth option just enough for streaming Netflix).  
2. Hours of usage per day - helps estimate monthly usage. You don't always need to sign up for unlimited plans.  
3. Time of usage - depends on connection and ISP but I have faced situations before where the bandwidth drops in speed (aka more buffering) on friday nights and weekends when more people are possibly downloading content. This will affect quality of entertainment when Internet is your only entertainment option at home.  
4. Type of usage - streaming (requires bandwidth) vs gaming (bandwidth and latency)   
5. Most importantly, reliability of the ISP connection. I am without cable TV for last few months now but occasionally my connection gets into an unusable state. Calls to the local operator gets me ""we will check in the morning"" and it hurts. Imagine watching live sports stream and wishing you had cable tv instead!  
  
Bottomline, keep your mind open for cable tv as well if QoS is not that great in your neighborhood. Jio wouldn't meet the requirements if you plan to continuously stream for 4-5 hours a day. You'll need at least 5 GB or more per day. It's better to get a local broadband with unlimited plans.  I was faced with the same question 3 months back.
When we moved into our new house each room had Sony smart TV’s.The amount of data used is a lot more on bigger screens.We bought a few WIFI’s with 70-100 mbps speed.We can stream 4K on every tv without any lags.When the Internet is down I connect my Airtel postpaid through hotspot to the TV and once I was watching a movie on Netflix and it consumed 30GB data.So prepaid is definitely not a option and especially I wouldn’t recommend JIO.Get a wifi. In my previous house, we had a few months when we had to live with a 2 Mbps connection. My mum used to stream SunNxt and YuppTV a lot, and these were not really optimized. Still, we managed to stream without any hassle - we had the 1000 GB floating with our 100 GB monthly, and I think we consumed less than 200 GB a month. Netflix's highest quality stream is 15.6 Mbps

Amazon's 4k streams are 11.5 Mbps.

Assuming multiple people use your network, for a small place 25-30 Mbps is plenty.

1.5 GB is 2 episodes Max at 1080p or something like 1.5 hrs of 1080p content For similar purpose I am using 50mbps and unlimited data plan. As I checked few times it was  like 3gb + consumed per day Try to go for bsnl 3g unlimited plan just like me which gives around 10mbps. I use jio tv app on my android tv and it uses around 200 mb in half hour. netflix 4k also works so I never bothered to check how much data it uses.",Entertainment,2019-02-12 11:09:33

These superstition TV programs reinforces and strengthens superstition in society in the name of tradition and culture. Cause there is huge difference in 'Showing' and 'Believing'. And many people do understand that.  Cause my mum still believes I like girls and more than opp gender is because I went out at night with my untie hair, i got subdued by a *dayan*. :P


Also, everytime i fell sick or didn't perform well during exams. I was jinxd or rather cursed by my neighbor aunties :P

 Dude, every country does that. Supernatural is one of the longest running tv shows (13 Seasons). And it is awesome! I miss Crowley though.  coz people watch that shit Not only that, movies like 2.0 which shows pseudoscience and stuff...smh

  


We need to do shows and movies with every element of making validated by scientific rigor imo. So that it can be edutainment too. Because they can. Freedom of expression.  The horror genre has always about superstition and religious beliefs

There wasn't a lot of scientific logic in Poltergeist and Rosemary's Baby either It's all for entertainment folks. Chill out.  From the few minutes I've watched, at no point did the show even attempt to be believable. They fall under the same genre as Tumbbad.  Because, you are not the""target population"" .If you're making this post in English, you're probably 0.000000000000001% of the population. And your opinions, tastes in movies, music, gender equality, superstition, political views etc don't mean shit. I am unable to express the rage I feel while watching ads for this kind of shows. Previously shows like Vikram vetal, Chandrakanta were famous.

So they are just tapping in indian fiction for entertainment.

  
 Because you are not their customer Because unlike you and me, many Indians are fucking superstitious. रहस्य की रोमांचक है( Mystery is exciting )-------for billions of Indians..... and even tv channels also promote it ... You have a problem with that? Don't watch it then. Simple Why won't they? There's easy money in providing cheap to produce content that caters to the large superstitious audience. Well it's just Indian fiction scene in entertainment industry?

",Poes_Ting," In my case, I enjoy OMG because of its simpler story. It's just about God, a guy who doesn't believe in God and the business in name of God. In PK, there's just too much stuff, an alien, a India-Pakistan love story, religious stuff and an alien falling in love with a girl and a sudden bomb blast. Both PK and OMG has a similar message but I found OMG's delivery better OMG still has Akshay Kumar playing god, so it doesn't per se invalidate religion, where as pk questions the existence of god himself/herself. PK  is appealing to atheists, where as OMG is appealing to less religious or dogmatic people who believe in God but are fed up with the hardliners..

P.S - clearly I have a lot of time in my hands.. I like the MSG series. OMG released before PK and had all the themes that was in PK with simpler message whereas PK was all over the place. If you had watched OMG before PK then you will understand why most people like it as its like watching a repeat of it. Then PK also had many story lines which people have watched numerous times like misunderstanding, leaving your love etc. 

PK may have been the weakest Rajkumar Hirani Movie. it's mostly because of whole love story drama that's in PK (people are tired of bollywood romance genre) also OMG was released before PK and had same concept overall with better storyline imo so naturally people had already seen it all Paresh rawal is far more funnier than aamir to be honest.  OMG spoke against organised religion and the commercial machine that it is now. It more clarity in what it wanted to be, and its protagonist was a relatable average Indian with an average family and relatable problems. It didn’t try to find mistakes in people’s faith. It was a small middle class family against the world fighting for their livelihood. 

PK was this over produced, glossy Bollywoodized, melodramatic production. I barely remember anything about PK but I clearly remember laughing at the climax with the entire TV trial. 

Also OMG came first.  IMHO, OMG's packaged to be understood by everyone and anyone and have more elements of commercial bollywood entertainment than PK that focused a little more on making you question things as a concept.

An entertaining movie usually gets more love than a good movie, and maybe this is just me being partial towards PK, but OMG was definitely lower in quality storytelling with over the top characters in everyway. 

To each their own, OMG seems to have entertained more people than PK. The concept of both the movies are same. Neither OMG nor PK question the existence of GOD, but deals with fake babas who took advantage of gullible believers. I liked both the movies.

The only difference, IMO, is that one is acted by Canada Kumar, a hindu, most patriotic, India Loving Kanedian, other one is a muslim who, incidentally, happens to be an Indian.  I rarely heard any abuse for the director/producer/writer of PK, but all the nationalists abused Aamir Khan to their hearts' content. Movie relating to god so IMO I don’t think the two movies are similar enough for a comparison as PK is about an alien trying to navigate through society to get back home while OMG is about a guy trying to make God legally liable  Akshay Kumar ",Entertainment,2018-12-27 15:59:06

"Food should be sold at regular prices In multiplexes, says Bombay HC",630,89x5hy,https://www.indiainfoline.com/article-amp/news-top-story/food-should-be-sold-at-regular-prices-in-multiplexes-says-bombay-hc-118040500014_1.html,186,,shr612," Having audited one of India's top multiplex, the multiplex profit comes mostly through sale of food and beverages, a good part of money they collect from selling movie ticket goes to the movie producer and with the rest they can't even pay the electricity bills, profit comes from sale of food, beverage, advertisements, rent etc.. That is why they have to charge such a huge rate for their counter sales. 

Essentially, theaters make as little as 20-30% of the total revenue from the movies they show, with the rest going to the studios, due to uneven financial negotiations (studios get around 90% of the revenue from a movie in its first week of release, which diminishes over subsequent weeks with more money going to the theaters). This causes cinemas to seek money from other areas, and concessions are the logical choice -- the studios can't touch them, and they can mark them up to the point where they're actually profitable. This price-gouging actually keeps theaters in business, believe it or not, since they don't make a lot from the movies themselves.  What does regular price mean? 

Samosa at the road side vendor at Rs10? At the normal restaurant at Rs30? At a good upscale chaat shop for Rs50? At a high end resturant for Rs200. In a five star at Rs350?  Can the court get involved in how much a private company sells their goods for? This seems absurd. Let the free market decide  Multiplexes make money on everything apart from the ticket sales. I see all the responses about how its their main source of profits, but isn't this decision now compelling the theatres to re-negotiate their deal with the producers/distributors. I don't think price regulation is their job. Heh! Such a stupid open ended verdict.

Every vendor inside is at their own liberty to set the price. If the customers want, they can take it or leave. It is not an essential product. Nobody is charging a mandatory F&B price and then not allowing you to bring food. Now that is extortion. Not the current model.

If the government/HC really wants to regulate prices and be a good-guy, why do food at Airport cost much higher than outside prices? I'd suppose that's more of an essential service than in a multiplex!

And if multiplexes allow outside food, people will come with all sorts of food and make a complete mess. The entire hall would smell of random food. That is why most establishments prevent outside food. Food is crazily priced in some theatres, but why should government regulate the prices of food sold in a private business? Tomorrow, they'll try to control prices of food in restaurants too?  What is meant by regular price? How goverment is going to determine the regular price? And people wonder why infrastructure is so shit in India while they go emigrate to white countries, fuck some shit up in here India with socialist practices and go live in capitalist countries while enjoying the benefits of capitalism and then ranting how India is so shite and all the people here oppress the minorities living in slums  Why stop at theater? Why not airlines? 5 star hotels? This is a ridiculous ruling, and will mean the end of the multiplex industry in Bombay, and possibly the rest of the state. why is the court deciding the price of the food? It is not that anyone is putting a gun and asking people to buy the overpriced shit. shit like this is the reason we are an underdeveloped shit hole. no one is putting a gun on your head and making you pay for expensive movie theater food. can't afford, don't buy. 
 Socialist utopia. Why would theatre owners spend lacs of rupees as rent when they can't make good money?  This is why we don't have nice theatres here. M just a regular Joe who watches movie, but once I read some article where it was mentioned that almost ALL of the profit from selling tickets is taken by the movie studio,production team n whatsoever.
So if we ask them to reduce the price of food Nd beverages, how on earth will they survive.
Don't they think it through before making any decision?
 Cars should also be sold at regular prices. I am looking at you Toyota. Why is Fortuner costing me 35 Lakhs+ when Maruti makes the same 4-wheeler Alto at 4.5Lakhs. 

There should be a law capping the price of cars.
 [deleted] Don't know about the food but a cup of water should be free at the cinemas and packaged water should be no more rs 20. More than food items I would want something to be done about the ads that are shown. There are instances where I've seen upwards of 20 mins of ads during the interval only. Ticket prices will increase. Waiting for the courts to order same tax for German cars as Maruti . Why not ? I mean what is luxury and fuck logic.  Fat chance of this actually happening This is ridiculous. Who exactly do they think sets these ""regular prices""? Right. Because more important and pending cases can wait. Let's discuss obnoxious pricing of food in theatre.  Do our courts have nothing better to do?  I neither watch movies in theaters nor have to buy food from theaters. Love being in the win-win situation. I wish single screen theatres would come back. They were affordable.


These multiplexes are just places rich kids can go. It's good for the consumer(probably), I get it, but is the judiciary the best Insttution to decide things like these? They'll find a loophole. I guarantee it. Food have to be Reasonable prices. Momo for rs 100 seems okay as was available a year ago. It is difficult to define regular prices. This should be implemented all over India.

Those players have long since retired but now these people are stuck with the initial anchor and refer to the team as ""we"" and ""us""


Also, I understand that in order to enjoy a game you need to root for a team and follow its ups and downs.

It's not as if those multibillion dollar corporations, I mean ""clubs"", think of them as anything more than dumb merchandise customers. Some are 'paid' members of the club.

A lot of the 'fans' are plastic.   Let them. They should be able to enjoy it as long they aren't interfering with anyone. They feel a sense of belonging and agency in being associated with a club.

ISL and recent television coverage of Indian football has definitely brought more interest to local football in India. But, the entitlement of the campaign where the likes of Kohli, Ranbir Kapoor and Neeta Ambani patronize us to become the fans for a sport really irritates me.

If anything, I get put off from watching games when I see that advertisement. If they actually put highlights of a game and show Indian players scoring great goals or make great tackles or saves, I would be much more interested.

What do you guys (and girls) feel?",Monsultant," Never seen the Ad but it’s simple for me .

I watch sports for entertainment not for venting any Nationalistic feelings .

So will watch ISL if it’s entertaining and has decent quality . No ones gonna make me interest in something with incessant ads if I don’t like it .  Banna padega kya hai? Bhechod zabardasti hai kya fan banneki?  I think India as a whole is about guilt-tripping people into doing things they don't want to do. subcounsiously putting thoughts in our minds.. Yeah this is pretty ridiculous. To me football is a more club sport than country because clubs pay the players and most weeks the players play for their clubs. Once in couple of years there are continental cups or World cup which of course generated interest but if I am getting the quality and entertainment in European leagues why would I watch ISL?

One reason could be the local club thing. For instance a lot of Europeans watch their local club as they are deeply associated with local populace but these clubs have nothing like that. Maybe Mohan Bagan and East Bengal may have decent fan following because of their presence in local community. I was really triggered by the ad, and other one where they showed that watching European Leagues is like betraying your country. I'll support national team when they are in an international tournament, but I don't want to support your clubs funded by obnoxious celebrities, who got into it just to make their public image better.  India will never play WorldCup in next 100 years. Do what y'all all want. India is Cricket crazy, not Football or Hockey or Tennis or Kabaddi or Basketball. And 10% fans are not entire India. India is a majority Poor nation who cannot go beyond Cricket which they understand. Football is meh. So whatever ISL BSL name you can give, facts and stats don't change.
Chutiyas will never understand this and I'be been telling this for 20 years at least. Indians are no match for European and English Football scene. Even Asians are no match for them, period. just ignore it and watch PL Basically, they want people to stop complaining about Indian Football team not being big at world stage. They are not big because they don't have viewers/fans. With next to no fans/supporters, sponsors don't invest thus leading to poor infra and development.

When asked , all they do is go for movies and parks or some lake nearby.  A bit of research showed this is the same case for every  place in India barring 4 metros.  They literally have zero social life outside or TV and movies.   100 cr for a movie seems a lot less when 99% of Ur country doesn't have much to spend on other than movies. You should know that a lot of the ""revenue"" from such marketable movies are from channeling black money through and turning it white.

Theaters will run ""house full"" for every show even if very few people show up. They will issue tickets for ghosts viewers. The money that they collect as ticket sales can not be traced back, since it is all multiple small cash transactions.

All this collected revenue, even if they pay a substantial tax, is all good for them because they made a good percentage of the previously unusable black money into legal white.

For eg, if a shitty theater in a god forsaken town has 300 seats and sells a ticket for 100 each.
300 x 100 x 5 x 30 = 45 lakhs that is getting washed every month from a single building. Of this a certain percentage will definitely be genuine transactions, but even then the are very few other businesses where you can wash this much money this efficiently They have no need to show where their viewers got the money from. 2.4 huh?

Don't indulge in **mindless entertainment**. This tip might sound quora-ish but it is very effective in self improvement. In modern times, we have a plethora of entertainment options ranging from meme hunting to watching never ending IPL matches. My point is that try to indulge in those activities more which enrich you and make you a better person. Like instead of mindlessly watching IPL matches, read some books about different philosophical ideas of the world (everything is on the internet today!) like Nietzsche's Amor fati or Shankracharya's Vaidanta. It's so much better as it helps develop your brain and makes you well read. At the same time provides you with more than enough dopamine to be classified as entertainment/free-time. Instead of stalking that hot chick on FB whom you don't have the balls to invite to a date, learn about dating psychology from youtube videos of Matthew Hussey or even Jordan Peterson. Some other ""enriching entertainment"" I would recommend, exploring your mind and body through meditation and intense exercise, pushing your limits by meeting new people ( hell there are so many people to meet around, doesn't matter if they don't like you, you will most likely never even meet them again), pushing your creativity by doing stupid things like staring at a wall for hours(doing nothing boosts your creativity), or challenging your brain by doing something  completely new like if you are an Art's graduate try learning about mathematical integration from the net. All these activities can be your new entertainment ideas, why be a sheep and do what everyone else does? Investing in yourself is very important when you are young. Life is so much better when you are a better person. It's not bad to indulge in mindless entertainment(clocking countless hours of video games , surfing the internet mindlessly, indulging in social media drama, excessive porn, frivolous chatting on whatsapp etc.) inadvertently leads to regret and procrastination later . Cook your own food. That way you can save money and acquire a nice little hobby. * Freeze bread, don't refrigerate it if u have left over
* Buy Silicone ice trays, ice comes out like butter with 1 finger, no banging or twists/turns
* After a regular hot shower, take a 5 second cold one to close skin pores which can be prone to temp
* Dry ur toes with a napkin else they don't properly and get itchy
* Moisturize always
* Never pick any phone unless in your contacts, if its a genuine person - they will leave a message
* Use disposable emails for any compulsory sign ups
* Make pav bhaji and add a gits pav bhaji with it, coz whatever u do it wont give the street taste, if u add the packet one, it will double enhance ur dish
* Instead of applying butter to a cheese toast, add mayo and check the difference
* Buy smaller cans of soda/pop/cold drink

So stupid, confusing and misleading names - dhamaal mix, dhamaal kids. Not showing channel list clearly, you have to click a few times and a sad looking popup appears after few retries.

Why can't they simply allow me to pick a list of channels I want to see and just pay for those? 
Imagine if someone comes up with such a DTH service, it would be awesome. I'd buy it instantly.",akahorizon," Same story is with Dishtv man,
   sab ek thali ke chatte batte hai! Ten years ago, it was much worse. English channels were spread across multiple packs, each of which had a mix of channels that defied logic. For instance, BBC Entertainment was clubbed with a religious channel, a Hindi news channel, a Tamil entertainment channel, and other unrelated rubbish. If you wanted to get all the English channels, you'd have to subscribe to at least half a dozen packs. 

Shortly after the then-CEO of Tata Sky reshuffled the packs to group them by language and content, he quit the company. Whether he was asked to leave because of that, or whether he did it as a farewell fuck-you, we'll never know. I'm relieved to find out that I'm not alone. It's a fucking nightmare. Every time I plan and recharge my annual subscription, they empty my wallet within the first 2-3 months. The web interface is definitely unpleasantly designed on purpose.  Same with Airtel. Yes, it is really confusing. Plus, they don't allow you to change package till you add ample amount in your tata sky account. So basically if you want to add a single channel, you will first have to add your monthly amount or make your account value equal to monthly value plus extra amount for new channel one wants to subscribe.

I think it is part of their business plan to extract more money. By default every customer is given ultra hd pack free for 1st month. Once started, most people tend to ignore renewal unless it is actually time. When that time comes and person sees the hard process, they might just skip it, recharge the Rs. 735 p.m. and be done with it. So where a person can save money and get pack of Rs. 450, the hard process makes person spend Rs. 735 instead.",Entertainment,2018-08-09 22:16:10

Wire is absolutely among the top-5 best TV series I have seen. Amazing story of why Baltimore is such a mess. 
 Season 2 is one of the most intimate portrayals of good vs bad. The end will leave you empty.

Now waiting for the West wing Time to revisit this Compared to my downloaded, the length of the first episode on Hotstar seems to be shorter. Is this censored? Omar's Coming Yo! Much obliged!! Jimmy Fuckin McNulty....hells yeah. Awesome!! Thanks OP.

Can't wait to watch it yet again Yaaaaaaas. Finally. Thank u for the info.  One of the best tv series IMO along with The west wing, The office, Breaking Bad and Mr. Robot Those who haven't watched, please do. 

It might get 'slow' for some people after Season 2 but just keep at it, you'll be blown away by Season 4.

IMHO greatest show of all time.  On another note.. Futurama is back as well https://np.reddit.com/r/megalinks/comments/7k1ppk/movie_the_wire_s1s5_br_x265_1080p_6ch_aac_664_gb “If I hear the music, I’m gonna dance.” Kima Greggs Khada ho Gaya bc! Is it the remastered HD one?  Streaming 1080p on android had some glitches, so the team had it removed for some time.  FUCK YES! This is one of those shows which lingers on in your mind days after you've finished watching it. During characters, incredibly realistic portrayal of the challenges of the American urban life.

For those who claim it's slow paced, I would advice them to treat it as a novel with numerous layers. It's uncensored? My favorite show.

Most HBO shows including this build momentum slowly. Which means you need to hold on for the first 3-4 episodes and then you are hooked. God I hate this show,  moves at the pace of a snail and the final pay off isn't rewarding enough.Gave up mid way through the second season.



And its just an ugly show you know.Like Breaking Bad was negative  and upsetting at times but there was a sense of thrill and entertainment ,Wire was just a slog.


 Best tv series ever made! Dump that horrible shit of a show Game of Thrones and watch this. It was best until Breaking Bad came.",Entertainment,2018-01-02 00:25:07

**Reliance Jio set to disrupt home entertainment business** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI:

Reliance Jio

plans to launch fixed-line broadband services in the country as the two-year-
old telecom company steps up its push on digital services, boosting its
revenues and subscriber base. The company is running beta trials of the
service—to be called Jio Gigafiber—in ""tens of thousands of homes"" and will
launch it on August 15.

Jio

Gigafiber

's simultaneous introduction in 1,100 cities will make it the largest
greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout anywhere in the world, said

Mukesh Ambani

, chairman of

Reliance Industries

(RIL), Jio's parent. Ambani's aggressive intent led to a fall in the shares of
cable TV operators. Hathway Cable, Den Networks, GTPL Hathway and Siti
Networks declined 15.4 per cent,10.7 per cent, 7.5 per cent and 2.8 per cent,
respectively. Dish TV closed with a marginal 0.6 per cent gain. However, RIL
investors were not enthused. The company's stock closed 2.5 per cent lower at
Rs 965 in Thursday's flat market.

Jio's stormy entry into the mobile telephony and data market — where it has
mopped up 215 million subscribers in less than two years — has already roiled
the telecom sector, driving rivals into desperate consolidation moves.

""While India has pole-vaulted into global leadership in the mobile broadband
space, the country lags behind significantly in the fixed-line broadband,""
Ambani said. ""Poor fixed-line infrastructure has been a key reason for this.
We (Jio) want to take India to be among the top five in fixed-line broadband
connectivity,"" Ambani added. Currently, India is placed 134th in the global
ranking for fixed broadband.

""In countries with better developed communication infrastructure, more than 80
per cent of data consumption happens indoors through fixed-line connectivity
in home, offices and other premises,"" said Ambani, addressing RIL's annual
general shareholders meet.

Jio's broadband service will include a router, a set top box and a landline
phone, among other things. Though Ambani didn't reveal the tariff for

Jio Gigafiber

, he said that the service will enhance home entertainment experience, allow
multi-party video conferencing, voice-activated virtual assistant and home
surveillance solutions.

His elder two children, Akash and Isha, also directors at Jio, demonstrated
the wireline broadband service to the packed auditorium of shareholders,
journalists, RIL executives and Ambani family members. Akash's fianceé Shloka
Mehta too was present among the audience, her first appearance at the oils-to-
telecoms enterprise's shareholder meet.

""The launch of Jio Gigafiber will open new revenue stream for RIL's digital
services business although we await a price plan for the broadband services,""
said Abhijeet Bora, analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

Now I don't need to stuff my books into the shelf. I can put them all up for display, and they're also almost entirely free of dust.

2. Thermos bottle for work. I recommend Milton, though I bought some local thing. It's excellent for cubicle dwellers as it keeps the cold water cold and hot water hot. I even took it on a trip to preserve ice cubes, and it did. That's the only way to smuggle alcohol wherever you want!

3. Good shoes. Always. Never ever ever compromise on shoes. I hate woodlands for what it did to my soles. I have since bought hush puppies, Nike and Lee Cooper, and my soles have been happy.

4. Kindle Touch!  I bought mine in 2012 and it refuses to die. I want to buy a new one but this one is going strong so I love it. I've dropped it more than my phone, and I've been everywhere with it. The battery backup is still. Amazing. Four years, and no disappointment. Plus, I had a friend get it from the US, so it cost me just 3500 rs.  Small USB powered fan.

Kindle Paperwhite - can now carry books everywhere and read what I feel like reading whenever. two years or so ago I bought a slim wallet made of some papery plastic material (durable and waterproof).

it is fantastic. the first week of using it - I had to constantly pat my arse to check that it was actually there, it was so light and unobtrusive.

downsides? I can't carry coins anymore - we've set up a piggy bank at home where any coins received during the day are deposited. the bigger downside is that I cannot find that wallet any more; mine is starting to fall apart now and nobody sells another one quite like the one I have. K7 for lappy

 Mechanical keyboard. I've a TVS Gold keyboard, and it has dramatically changed my typing experience. 

I am a software engineer, I spend a lot of time in front of computers and getting a mechanical keyboard seemed like an obvious choice to me. Pressured my parents to get one while doing engineering. My typing speed averages at 100wpm.

**Why is 1999 movie ‘Sooryavansham’ Sony Max’s favourite offering?** 

 ______ 
A still from film Sooryavansham.

**New Delhi:** In the respective weeks of both their television premieres, the two biggest blockbusters of 2017, war epic _Baahubali 2: The Conclusion_, and slapstick comedy _Golmaal Again _notched up top ratings, show data from BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council). But interestingly, _Baahubali _that premiered in October last year and _Golmaal _that was aired in February this year, both had one common name that made it to the BARC list of top five films that week—Amitabh Bachchan’s 1999 drama _Sooryavansham_. 

A remake of Tamil film _Suryavamsam _(1997), the E.V.V. Satyanarayana directed
film notched up 4.4 million BARC impressions on Sony Max compared to
_Baahubali_’s 26 million on the same channel and 4.7 million impressions
compared to _Golmaal Again_’s 16 million on Star Gold. Impressions refer to
the number of individuals (in thousands) of a target audience who viewed an
event, averaged across minutes. BARC India is the country’s TV viewership
monitoring agency.

Nearly 20 years after release, the box office disaster that made less than Rs7
crore in total theatrical earnings, is topping television ratings on Sony Max
that may air it as frequently as once a month. But it is not the only one.
Senior executives from television channels name flops like dark fantasy action
film _Jaani Dushman- Ek Anokhi Kahani _(Rs10 crore), _Tarzan The Wonder Car
_(Rs6 crore), romantic comedy drama _Ramaiya Vastavaiya _(Rs26 crore), Akshay
Kumar comedy _Entertainment _(Rs64 crore) and romantic drama _Shaadi Mein
Zaroor Aana _(Rs15 crore) as examples of films that have emerged as
blockbusters on television despite not setting the cash registers ringing on
theatrical release.

The first reason for this is the distinct nature of the Indian television
viewing world. Many, if not most Hindi films made today are sharp and well-
shot, the content is modern, the issues contemporary and the depiction of
intimacy between characters matches global standards. 93% of the country, on
the other hand, exists in a one-television household reality.

“Television viewing essentially is community viewing,” said Neeraj Vyas,
senior vice-president and business head, Sony Max cluster, Sony Pictures
Network. “So in a small town like Kanpur or Allahabad, I could go to the
theatre to watch (a new-age film like) _Queen _with my friends, appreciate it
in the darkness and privacy of a cinema hall and come out saying I’ve seen
something nice, but the same film doesn’t work on TV because I’m watching it
with my immediate and extended family.”

Television, Vyas added, is a representation of the average Indian, the mass
consumer who enjoys stereotypical scenes, situations and songs and comes back
to them whenever he can. A family entertainer like _Sooryavansham _will always
work on television because it not just allows for emotional peaks and curves
every couple of minutes but can be watched in segments or its entirety with at
least one other member of the family multiple times without discomfort.

While there may not always be a direct correlation between box office flops
going on to do well on television, Ashish Bhasin, chairman and chief
executive, South Asia, Dentsu Aegis Network, said since the theatrical release
of films is time-bound, very often there are films that don’t do well
initially but are considered great later on. Clashing with a big film may have
impacted collections, for instance, whereas on TV you don’t have to fight for
an audience and viewing is free.

Further and more importantly, the films Bollywood is churning out today don’t
make for television-friendly viewing. Commercial entertainers that appeal to
the lowest common denominator are rare and the films that do get made mostly
tend to be experimental and niche subjects that cater more to big-city,
multiplex audiences, and consequently don’t find much success on the small
screen. According to the Ficci-EY media and entertainment industry report
2017, the number of single screens in India has come down from 9,710 in 2009
to 6,780 in 2017, multiplexes, on the other hand, have gone up from 925 to
2,750 during the same period. The audience used to watching single screen kind
of mass entertainment films, is not getting the chance to watch them anymore
because movies are made to reach out to multiplex audiences who are restricted
to the metros and mini-metros. Older massy films like _Sooryavansham_, come to
their rescue, in that scenario.

“Films are not made primarily for TV audiences and producers first think in
terms of recovery from theatres, so the larger ecosystem of TV audiences
doesn’t get what it wants in terms of content supply,” pointed out Ruchir
Tiwari, business head, Zee Hindi Movies Cluster.

At this moment, Tiwari said, Bollywood is not dishing out, not more than five
films out of 200 a year that work on TV. The cinema that Bollywood has stopped
making may not be commercially viable from a theatrical point of view but is
relevant for most of India.

“The mindset of a TV consumer is geared towards repeat consumption. He would
love to watch a nice film in theatres maybe once, but genres outside of (massy
ones like) action, drama and comedy will work only once or twice on TV, they
are not everyday consumption,” Tiwari said.

"Bollywood's Terrible 2017: Why the industry sputtered this year, and what it means for its future.",72,7nfr9f,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/12/bollywoods-terrible-2017/549443/,21,,thaskizz," I'm sure Bollywood's response to this is to launch more star kids in 2018. Bollywood has a handful of good actors and good technicians, but absolute shit scriptwriters in mainstream cinema. What are hit movies from 2017, can anyone tell? Bollywood's answer to this will be Remakes and Sequels. Some of the movies of 2017 were Judwaa 2, Golmaal 4, Fukrey 2, Bahubali 2, Jolly 2, Tiger Zinda hai, Badrinath, Shubh mangal, Ok jaanu, Chef which were all Sequel and Remakes. And this trend is not exclusive to bollywood, even hollywood is on the same trend.  Daniel was literally the best foreign movie in China I'm 2018 pretty sure that counts for something.  reddit-like crowd is to be blamed/thanked for ensuring that this nepotistic and eugenics-based industry is still surviving.

A couple of decade ago, shit movies would have made tremendous losses. But today, Bollywood has to thank  shit-city-planning-like-blr-where-the-only-thing-to-do-is-go-to-malls and urban-poor-who-crib-about-prime-becoming-999 but will gladly pay 100+ for a single coffee..

Just like the diamonds-are-rare scam, Bollywood has convinced these-so-called-urban-poor that it is totally fine to spend 1000s+ on movies in big multiplex.. With those kind of tickets, even shitty movies make enough money within a month. 

(And no - don't fall for that scam either that the movies are made with 100x crore budget. Hence, need to recover the cost. The majority of these **costs** are payouts to the actors, and the actors today are smart to take a percentage of the revenue - aka hollywood accounting. In fact, the costs are nothing but expensive hotel stays, food and lifestyle  etc for the involved team - aka kind of a payout to the involved folks. That's like Infosys saying the cost of this software is 100M, since the software engineers staying in a 5-star hotel while coding it). 

We have been conned into thinking that pay more for better experience is the right thing to do. And viola - everyone pays more..because they want the best experience.

Star India tuning out of Channel V,53,7eokbd,http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/IbmvKfRcewrLcKYCEEla1O/Star-India-tuning-out-of-Channel-V.html,48,,piezod," LOL,

Till 7-8 years ago, it was complete music channel. Back in my school & college days MTV and Channel V were only 2 major music channels. Then came B4U, Z ETC and others.

MTV started Roadies and Splitsvilla and turned itself into youth centric channel. But they maintain mix of music and shows. Channel V turned themselves into youth centric channel. Except, Gumrah, I don't remember any other show catching up. Dare2Dte was nice but got discontinued soon.

For last 2-3 years, Channel V has been switching between being music channel and youth show based channel. it changes sometimes on monthly basis. This was bound to happen. The old channel V and MTV were some of the best things growing up
but after 2010 it just went down hill. I miss the old channel [v] ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**Star India tuning out of Channel V** 

 ______ 
In 2012, it was reinvented as a fiction and reality show channel. However, in four years’ time, last July, it switched to being a youth-focused music brand.

Star India’s music channel, Channel V, is downing shutters this week and it will be replaced by a sports channel. Star India has declined to comment on this change.

Why Star may be launching a Kannada sports channel (Star Sports 1 Kannada) in lieu of its music channel is easy to understand from the strategy which Star India’s chairman and chief executive Uday Shankar has been following—that of a sharp focus on sports. With the launch of a Tamil sports channel in May, the network boasts of a cluster of 10 sports channels. That’s not all. In September, Star India Pvt. Ltd bid for and won the broadcast and digital streaming rights (Indian and global) to the Indian Premier League Twenty20 cricket tournament for the next five seasons for Rs16,347.50 crore.

Star Sports Kannada’s launch this week will coincide with the start of the fourth edition of the Indian Super League football tournament, reflecting Star Network’s interest in boosting its sports portfolio.

However, the closure of Channel V may come as a big disappointment for its fans. Channel V has, after all, been around for more than 20 years even though it has had a roller coaster ride in the country pitted, as it was, against MTV.

Interestingly, MTV was very much part of Star’s India journey when it was first launched here. Star TV (now Star India) launched with channels such as MTV (through a tie-up with Viacom), Star Movies and Star Plus (an English language channel initially) in its portfolio. When Star wanted to increase the content mix of MTV to make it more Indian, it was not acceptable to MTV owners. So MTV moved out of the Star platform.

Consequently, Star launched its own music channel—Channel V. This was an Asia launch with a separate beam for India (and South-East Asia). Channel V for India had both English and Hindi content with Video Jockeys like Sophiya Haque and Ruby Bhatia.

MTV, meanwhile, returned to India with a slot on Doordarshan and later launched as a full-fledged music channel competing with Channel V. It had a mix of local and international content.

In its heydays, Channel V created several memorable characters like Udham Singh—the Haryanvi jat, a role played by Munish Makhija. Lola Kutty was another popular character played by theatre artiste Anuradha Menon. She interviewed celebrities on the channel as a sari-clad woman from Kerala who spoke English with a Malayali accent. With inventive programming, Channel V became a cool brand for young Indians.

But MTV too was gaining popularity. Channel V came under pressure and tried to be more like MTV even as the two rivals tried to outsmart each other.

“It is unfortunate that Channel V is closing down,” says Ashish Patil, former chief executive at MTV India, now vice-president brand partnerships and talent management at Y-Films, the youth arm of Yash Raj Films. Patil spent 12 years at MTV. “The trouble is, Channel V used to have a re-launch every three years,” says Patil. “Meanwhile, MTV kept reinventing with music, lifestyle, romance, gadgets as well as reality shows such as Roadies and Splitsvilla which are still around. We also did music awards, style awards and extended the brand into merchandise.”

An entertainment channel veteran, however, says that when Ronnie Screwvala-promoted UTV launched Bindass in 2007 positioned as a youth entertainment channel with shows like Emotional Atyachar which gave it both ratings and better advertising yield, MTV and Channel V blinked and have since kept changing their content.

Last year, MTV strategically launched MTV Beats channel to cater to an audience looking for Bollywood music. That allowed the channel to focus on youth-based content which has hits like Splitsvilla, Roadies and India’s Top SuperModel, among other programmes. Interestingly, while MTV Beats has been classified as a Hindi music channel under the Broadcast Audience Research Council (Barc) India ratings, MTV falls under the youth entertainment category.

According to the latest ratings by Barc, Channel V is ranked number seven among Hindi music channels after MTV Beats which is at number six. The top slot is taken by music channel Mastii, which is run by Sri Adhikari Brothers Television Network Ltd (SABTNL) and has been number one for close to five years.

To stay relevant to its audiences, Channel V changed tack a couple of times. In 2012, it was reinvented as a fiction and reality show channel. However, in four years’ time, last July, it switched to being a youth-focused music brand. Accordingly, it shifted between being a youth entertainment and music channel in Barc classification too.

Besides changing tack, the channel also saw frequent changes in leadership. According to a media industry expert, there’s been lack of focus and consistency at Channel V—it has changed too many times and too drastically over the last few years. “The brand therefore has no positioning. It is too arduous a task now to come back from there. Too much money and effort would be required. It moved from music to fiction to music all in four years,” he says, declining to be named.

When the channel went into the realm of fiction, it had to compete with the general entertainment channels. “The ad rates didn’t match up and there were losses as a result of three hours of original programming on weekdays,” says the expert.

Channel V probably didn’t get its strategy right in the last 7-8 years. Lack of focus and sharp positioning along with little thought in branding took the channel down.

**Yogi govt to levy entertainment tax on IPL matches** 

 ______ 
International cricket matches as well as the Indian Premier League tournament will now come under the purview of entertainment tax in Uttar Pradesh.The Yogi Adityanath government has taken this decision to correct the anomaly whereby UP has been losing out on this source of revenue while states such as Delhi and Maharashtra have been levying entertainment tax for several years.Kanpur’s Green Park stadium is the sole international cricket venue in the state at the moment, but a 50,000-seat international-level cricket stadium is expected to come up soon in Lucknow. IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla recently said Lucknow could host matches of the professional Twenty20 cricket league in the next season. Kanpur hosted two IPL matches last week.“Due to some confusion earlier, entertainment tax was not being levied on cricket matches. The new government, vide an order on May 2, has decided to levy the same on tickets for all International cricket matches and the IPL matches,” UP’s additional entertainment tax commissioner Awadhesh Kumar Tiwari told ET.“It will be 25% of the ticket amount and the revenue is considerable… The ticket price is of significant value in the IPL match and it is a commercial venture and hence under purview of entertainment tax.” The Yogi government took the decision after detailed deliberations on the issue, according to the May 2 order.Tiwari said the state consulted Delhi government, which said that entertainment tax is levied on all cricket matches in Delhi.A few states such as Chhattisgarh have been waiving entertainment tax on IPL to bring matches to their venues. In 2010, Maharashtra had waived entertainment tax for IPL but soon reintroduced it after a controversy broke out.The UP government’s move to charge entertainment tax on IPL and other international cricket matches, which are money spinners, makes sense. It will boost the state’s revenues. The money can be used to step up facilities for sports other than cricket. But the levy should also be subsumed under the goods and services tax.

> He pointed out, apart from Tamil Nadu, **other neighbouring southern States have desisted from levying additional tax** on cinema over and above the Goods and Services Tax.

Contrary to what may be easily concluded. In this particular instance at-least, this is not a problem with GST. This is a state government issue that Tamil Nadu will have to resolve internally.  They can atleast remove the upper cap on tickets. GST will badly screw states like Maharashtra and TN, reducing them to beggars while benefiting states that resisted taking hard steps to improve on the wealth creation front.  you know what is by far the biggest thing ignored?

Students at IITs and central universities across the country would soon groove to patriotic music by rock bands visiting their campuses. The HRD Ministry has asked these institutions to host music bands who would be performing patriotic numbers. As part of the programme named “Yeh India ka time hai”, the government has identified certain bands which would be visiting campuses across the country and perform patriotic numbers, specially from Bollywood.

“A private entertainment firm has been taken on board which has identified around a dozen rock bands. The shows will be planned in various institutions over the next month,” a senior official said. The programme has been organised to celebrate 70 years of India’s Independence and 75 years of the Quit India Movement this year.

Earlier this month, the government had also asked all universities and educational institutions to take students to memorials of freedom fighters and residences of martyrs in the run-up to the 70th Independence day celebrations. The varsities and schools also organised an oath taking ceremony where students, teachers and non-teaching staff took a pledge to make the country a “terrorism-free, caste-free, corruption-free, uncleanness-free and poverty-free society”.

Industries will clamor to get the rate of their products reduced.  20% if it's a romance movie, 22% if it's an action movie, 24% if it's a comedy.   

Jet Lee is the king! This will lead to more piracy now so 60% if it is bhai movie? ^/s What if it's Rs.100? May be they should have kept 28% for IMAX and Gold class alone. Rest should have been 18%.  So cinemas are under sin tax now :( Netflix, Amazon prime, Piracy zindabaad. ""*Honey, we could make out at home while we watch. No GST in that.*"" I've not been to theaters after Mad Max: Fury Road. 

No movie can compare to the theater experience of that one.

So, are like, movie tickets more expensive now? I am feeling stupid right now. *One nation one tax*

Looooool. So, does this mean there is no more entertainment tax? Coz if Entertainment tax is eliminated, then tickets are getting cheaper in Mumbai. Currently, we pay 45% ET unless it is a Marathi movie.  ... so no tax if the price is exactly Rs. 100 ?! ;) ""simplifying taxation""

My ass. Will wait for the movie to show up on Amazon Prime or Hotstar. Else will pirate. Hell with GST  99 rupee tickets FTW Wah!! Wah!! Cinema houses with soft porn will continue to flourish. Master stroke!! It will give employment to lot of people. And why should rich people have lol the fun. /s

Other than these two, nothing much. Mr Robot is pretty solid.  try pornhub premium  The Man in the High Castle is excellent Striptease.  See smallville. Superman based tv show deleted   I tried watching Transparent. Almost every character comes out as gay.  If you haven't watched **Dexter** then i would recommend watching it but be aware it has gore scenes because it's story is about a serial killer who only kill the criminal. It is definitely not for watching with kids. I started watching season 1 last month and last night i started season 5. Frankly speaking i was getting a little bit bored after watching almost 48 episodes (50 min. each approx.) of 4 seasons but the twist at the end of season 4 made me to start season 5.

Why is Arnab Goswami so popular?,47,6ejw8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6ejw8j/why_is_arnab_goswami_so_popular/,32,"I know some people who watch his ""debates"" simply for the comedic value of a shouting match, but why do people watch his show seriously? He never talks about issues that actually matter anymore.",IndiaUnited1997," I guess people like to feel enraged about stuff. People feel powerless, and want someone to be their conduit for yelling at politicians or actors or whoever. Arnab fits this role perfectly  
  
- he chooses topics that are palatable, and presents them in a way where there's a clear black-and-white scenario (though barely anything of relevance in India is black and white anymore)  
- he pits groups against each other, takes sides and yells at the group you're not rooting for  
     
It's basically like watching a movie. It's really cathartic for some people when the underdog hero gets his comeuppance against the villain. In a similar manner, people experience a catharsis when Arnab yells at others. His audience is the underdog and he is doing what only most of them can dream of doing.  
  
The popularity of Arnab basically means a large number of people in India are extremely unhappy, either with how things are or with how things were. If Arnab is not responsible with his opinionated yelling matches, he has potential to be pretty destructive to a large group of people.   
  
Just imagine if the guy straight up misrepresents some facts about something that actually matters and browbeats anyone who disagrees. Who is his audience going to believe?  
  
I'm tempted to say that Arnab's popularity has something to do with urban India's psyche as a whole: hyper-aggressive, impatient, disenchanted, unhappy and roaring to get going. Some of these emotions may be due to the past, some may be due to the future. I think India, including people here, should just calm down for a few minutes and stop spitting fire at each other all the time, because we're running out of oxygen. I can draw a lot of parallels between his popularity and Reddit subs. That's the power of a community (top voted comments on popular subs vs arnab's theatrics). People in general like the show of strength. We are basically spectators of Roman colosseum in modern day. The ""debate"" is the gladiators tearing each other apart. Literally then, figuratively now.  Dhinchak Pooja is popular too #Dhinchakians  Entertainment. Entertainment. Entertainment.  Most people give attention to guys who scream loudly than those who make sense.  Remember those GDs, the ones for jobs, where the logical quite ones who stuck to the topic were shouted under by fellows sticking to their gun? That's what the general populace thinks of what a discussion/debate should be. One has to cobble another over the head with one's view points, a point of dominance if you will. One needs to prove their point, how best? Shout and scare the other person.

Arn00b is wish fulfillment of sorts. I once got shouted at by boss for someone else's faults, came back home, and by gosh watching arnub deal with someone and tune them out was so, so, calming. I can see why he's popular. The same reason why Bill O'Reilly was popular in the US.  Arnab always wins the argument. If his logic is no good, he just turns down his opponents mic and shouts. The average Indian has strong beliefs but is not particularly good at justifying them in an argument or listening to opposing points of view. They all secretly wish they could do in real life what Arnab does on his show. Everyone needs an echo chamber. The louder it gets, the more validated you feel. Arnab is the perfect representation of an educated, aspiring and upwardly mobile middle class that is increasingly western in its consumption pattern yet Indian in its outlook. Throw in some religion, a giant propaganda machine (Whatsapp), which is hellbent on reinforcing a Hindu victim complex and voila you have cancer that is The Republic.  He screams and shouts unlike anyone else we have on TV and argues by the ""reductio ad absurdum"" method. It's a very popular thing you'll see on American media like say Jon Stewart or John Oliver but not so much here. 

In our media it's more like a novelty so he's popular. I guess in a way he's the Kapil Sharma of News networks. He panders to the literate yet ghaati English speaking Indian. The kind who scoffs at the Queens English, and is a diarrheic mess when he encounters words such as *farrago* yet too upper class to listen to Hindi channels which have been trailblazers themselves (embedded chip in 2000 note) Well he is an unprincipled showman masquerading as a journalist. Everybody loves one of those. Every criticism i read against him also goes for other so called journalists the difference is he is more entertaining and speaks what a lot of people want to hear. Also not even his opponents have accused him of being corrupt on the other hand Barkha Dutt has been caught on tapes acting as middleman between politicians and corporations.  Arnab Goswami got his real peak in popularity after the 26/11 attacks where his great research on the matter and the fact that he got relavant people to come forth for his debates (which were more or less orchestrated)

At the time where ""Pakistan is bad"" excuse was not enough for the people to understand about those attacks he was the main source of information which created his huge viewer base but as time passed he started increasing his panel members to insane amounts by which having a sensible debate was wayy out of question it just became a hilarious confusionfest with the decking quality of topics and research that got poorer day by day lead to the Arnab you see today . I think NDTV, especially Ravish Kumar might be his exact opposite. Sometimes I do wonder, if Arnab's style does indeed work, to get more eyeballs, should one of these leftist/centrist media outlets go for someone who can out-shout him!

After featuring a plethora of iconic figures from the entertainment industry, Madame Tussauds Delhi is now planning to focus its attention on the great Indian leaders, beginning with those who influenced the Freedom Movement in the country, to inspirational leaders of the present era.

The special 'history zone' will pay tribute to the nation's heroes, including the figures of Bhagat Singh, Subhash Chandra Bose, Vallabhbhai Patel and Mahatma Gandhi. For the first time ever, guests will be able to meet and pay respects to figures of the leaders who paved the way for a new India.

Figure of Mahatma Gandhi

The interactive environment at the museum aims at creating a nationalistic environment for visitors, while commemorating the valuable contribution of each of the leaders towards building a nation.

Along with freedom fighters, the platform will also showcase the figures of APJ Abdul Kalam and Narendra Modi.

""It's an honour for us to include eminent personalities in our Delhi attraction and we are privileged to announce their names today. The figures of the heroes are immortalised by a special team of Madame Tussauds from London. Based on customer feedback and the demand of the presence of Indian heroes, our team has designed a dedicated history zone in the upcoming Delhi attraction. Our team in London carried out an immersive research while making these figures. Going forward, we will carry on adding more influential leaders, whose contribution is acknowledged, and we also consider the requests by our visitors,'' said Anshul Jain, general manager, director, Merlin Entertainments India.

[NP] Talkative Air India Pilot,84,5f6e03,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5f6e03/np_talkative_air_india_pilot/,67,Rather chatty pilot in the AI flight I was in today. Described everything from Tirupati to Nagpur while we passed them. The commentary was quite entertaining actually. Are pilots allowed to be that garrulous? Any pilots here?,glaedr95," My best chatty pilot experience was on a US domestic flight, flying over Washington DC. The pilot announces- *""Those of you sitting on left side of the plane, look to your left and you will see the Washington Monument. Those sitting on right side of the plane, look to your left and you will see a lot of passengers looking at the Washington Monument.""* Garrulous? Hello GMAT or GRE prepper. Well, I learnt a new word today. Chatty pilots being in-flight tour guide is pretty common on US domestic flights. In India, I have come across chatty pilots only on Air India. One guy pointed out to look for Matheran hill station on approach to Mumbai, another time the dude informed about every city we were passing on the way from Mumbai to Bangalore. I personally love pilots who are chatty. It shows they love flying, and is great entertainment for curious minds.

That being said, I have never for the life of me understood why the pilots announce what altitude they will be flying before takeoff. Has anyone ever thought ""nahi bhai, please 34,000 feet pe mat jaana. I don't like it. Can you please do 35,000 feet?"" Most planes are on autopilot when cruising.  Haha, yes, I'm a pilot with air India and we are allowed to make announcements like these. Depends on the pilot though, some make really good announcements and get commendations from both the passengers and the company :)  Hey, I am a pilot for a US airline. It depends person to person. But generally, most pilots I know don't talk to people a lot. A couple of important announcements is pretty much it. 

One reason for it may be the general behavior of the passengers. I am a F/O and sometimes I stand at the boarding door, thanking passengers for choosing my airline. Out of 10 people, 3 are downright arrogant, 4 chose to ignore me as if they didn't hear anything & one guy mumbles something. Maybe 1 or 2 persons actually say welcome or anything. 

Another reason may be the workload. Contrary to what movies may suggest, pilots have to work even when the flight is in cruise and on AP. For short flights of 2 to 3 hours, it becomes even more hectic. Plus some air space is very congested so you need to make constant changes in your flight path as advised by the ATC.

In case you're interested, here's my AMA: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/52q9tm/hi_rindia_i_am_a_commercial_pilot_for_a_major/?ref=share&ref_source=link)


 There's a reason pilots say the minimum and keep quiet. At best, even if everyone likes the banter, the pilot doesn't get paid extra or promoted or see any material rewards for the effort. At worst someone is offended and decides to complain that the pilot isn't doing his job.  i would love that rather than talking BS like we will take off and reach height of blah blah and due to 'traffic... '3 sec pause ''congestion'' blah blah Booked my first flight ever. Spice jet. I would've booked air India had I known it. 
 Best inflight entertainment. Hopefully not hazardous to safety.  I had a similar experience today morning on my AI flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru. Not exactly entertaining because I had a sleepless night, but too much information. Is it an AI thing? [More shit from the bogus *captain*](https://youtu.be/vdPy5Ikn7dw) It is really sad and frustrating that Air India have stopped in-flight entertainment on the domestic flights. The listings are still there in the in-flight magazine but it has been ages since I saw a working entertainment system now.  

If nothing, I loved to watch the current location on the map. On a recent trip, I got frustrated and decided to try out a GPS App while on flight mode. [It worked charmingly well](http://i.imgur.com/fefrREn.png) and I got real time updates about speed, altitude and location.

I would like that tbh. Upvoting for garrulous. TIL! I would love that, honestly. Meh, I prefer to sleep on my flights. This would be extremely irritating to me. Bhai what's the issue in that ?

India’s First Female Olympic Shot-Putter Can’t Take Coach to Rio as Officials Say ‘She Won’t Win Anyway’,197,4trh39,http://www.vagabomb.com/Indias-First-Female-Olympic-ShotPutter-Cant-Take-Coach-to-Rio/,42,,magicbook," That is why we need a clean up in Sports Ministry and Olympic committees! Politicians cannot run what they have no experience of!! You see SC has ordered to clean up BCCI, similarly they should remove all politicians from there and put expert sports athletes! This way nobody would have to be a sycophant to get a chance!  Someone should compile the list of people going to the Olympics on the tax payer's  tab. How many are actual competitors, their support staff, officials, and babus looking for a free holiday. 

Does anyone know if this information can be obtained? 
 Maybe, maybe it is true that she cannot win. She probably won't even be in the top 5. Her best throw would put her at about 18th rank in the 2012 olympics ([source 1](http://www.firstpost.com/sports/manpreet-kaur-breaks-national-shot-put-record-on-road-to-rio-olympics-2436374.html) [source 2](https://www.olympic.org/london-2012/athletics/shot-put-women) ). 

But, with a little push and training, even if she adds half a meter she is suddenly knocking at the door of top 10. A young collegiate athlete who understands the game and can throw a 17 meter would start believing that top 10 in the world is not that difficult. 

In 2020 we can have a sure top 10 athlete. In 2024 we can have a top 5 athlete, another top 10 athlete, possibly a bronze. Thereafter, we would be a constant presence in the event (one cannot always win the medal, but a medal will always be expected). Do this for even 30-40 events, we are sure to be expecting at least 10 medals every Olympics.

I am not saying we can become China or the USA at Olympics very quickly given our infrastructure, but a country which regularly gets more than 10 medals every Olympics is not difficult if our officials do their jobs even in the slightest.  This. Right here. Is THE reason why people in India don't and will never be able to take sports and games forward to the next level as a serious career choice. Little to no encouragement, infrastructure and funding. Not to mention the politics & corruption involved.

 I don't see this problem to be resolved atleast in my lifetime with all the narrow minded, uneducated and corrupt people leading and running this country. Did she report this incident? He should be fired.
 MSM lurkers can you please pick up this story and shame the officials please? disgraceful. this is just disgusting. Cost cutting !

The only problem here IMHO is that the official decided to be blunt/straight-talking. 

He should have made stories about ""need to get approval through proper channels"", ""check the procedures"", ""bell curve"" etc & then come back later with **no** as the answer. i bet the officials themselves are going! They seem to be missing the entire point of the olympics. By that token, not a single administrator or non-sportsmen should be allowed to go to rio. None of them have produced any medals for india, beside wasting a ton of our money on themselves and their family and friends. I thought it was an honor just to compete. That the goal of showing up is not only to win, but to inspire, promote, represent, encourage, have strength and courage, learn, network.

"One nation, multiple taxes for Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu; Will other states follow suit?",47,6ldj3u,http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/one-nation-multiple-taxes-for-maharashtra-tamil-nadu-will-other-states-follow-suit-2318453.html,13,,Lord-Lannister," >Where be the bot?

One nation, multiple taxes for Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu; Will other states follow suit?

There were a few states that earlier used to levy additional entertainment tax excluding films from their own region. To bring about a parity in the tax rate, a uniform tax of 28 percent tax on entertainment was decided by the GST Council.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime that came into effect from July 1 was a mammoth reform aimed at bringing about a system of ‘one nation, one tax’. However, states including Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, are imposing multiple taxes to meet the shortfall on taxes that have been subsumed into GST. Now, the fear is that other states may also follow suit.

GST has subsumed multiple taxes including central excise, value-added tax, service tax, octroi, sales tax and entry tax among others. However, in the case of entertainment tax, states were given powers to impose additional tax over and above GST.

Tamil Nadu has decided to levy 30 percent state entertainment tax over and above the 28 percent entertainment tax under GST. Theatre owners had maintained a shutdown on Monday protesting the new rates, since they would make movie tickets much expensive than other states.

Similarly, Maharashtra has hiked motor vehicle registration tax by 2 percent which will take the tax to about 13-15 percent for petrol and diesel vehicles. For two wheelers, it will go up to 10-12 percent depending on the type of vehicle and its price.

Pratik Jain, Partner and Leader Indirect Tax, PwC India ""Since state local bodies have been given the powers to impose additional entertainment tax over and above GST, some of them have gone ahead and imposed them. States which did not have this tax earlier should be persuaded to not impose this.”

Jain added that there is a fear that seeing Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, others may also follow suit and that this amounts to double taxation.

There were a few states that earlier used to levy additional entertainment tax excluding films from their own region. To bring about a parity in the tax rate, a uniform tax of 28 percent tax on entertainment was decided by the GST Council. But, local bodies were given a right to levy any additional tax in the area of entertainment.

M S Mani, senior director, Deloitte Haskins and Sells explained that this is not a welcome development. “After Mumbai abolished octroi which was 4.5 percent, registration tax for vehicles has been hiked by 2 percent. This effectively means that we are trying to get similar taxes through a backdoor. We are hoping that all states do not follow this practice,” he added. Haha.. Chutiya kat gaya, Maharashtra! Paid the highest amount of taxes, got a big punch in the nuts in the name of GST and now has to levy even more taxes to sustain themselves! 

This is 'Nationalist' Rajya for you, Maharashtra. > However, in the case of entertainment tax, states were given powers to impose additional tax over and above GST.

In such a scenario, why bracket them in 28% GST? It should have been 0-5%. Itna paisa centre main khayega kaun...nitin gadhakari",Entertainment,2017-07-05 19:50:38

He also was seen as a baby face ignorant Momma's boy prince by the Sanghi forces. They picked on him like that. Then Rajiv became the face of every household in India. 

If not for Rajiv, BJP would have still been telling us how Computers and Satellite television is against Hindu culture. Also, evil hands comes out of computer screens and TV if people brings on their homes. Children will turn in to British evil people if computers to be taught to them in Hindu families. Congress party is a Foreign hand ✋ for bringing Foreign companies like Microsoft and others to India. Congress party is Foreign evil hand ✋ for passing the bill of Satellite television which will only show Nudity in India.

Trust me, I have seen and heard every Sanghi bullshit they have come up with when they were always in opposition. They tried every bullshitting possible to twist common people minds. It always failed because it was proved otherwise. Now that new technology has entered, their old habits from the Sanghi old books hasn't stopped.

They think older folks don't remember things about what they did or said in the past. Most of their bullshitting came from pre Internet days, hence they are in denial assuming people who know them won't reveal their old past also. To the people of South, ask your older folks why BJP ideologies and their theories always failed in those States. Why technology was never part of Sanghi agenda in 70 years, for which the Sanghis always scoffed the south, who were more into Technology and Future. Why did they not encourage North belt towards South and mingle them in the '80s and '90s, when South region was adapting Technology and Computers. These are some questions which would definitely jitter every Sanghis. Hence they are ignorant towards the progress of South and tries to play evil games of Hindutva brainwashing like they do in North with Ram Mandir and Cow. Well I am glad they are still failing at that to some if not many extent.

So now they are in fear that Rahul should never take Rajivs place, hence they were pinning him down as pappu so that another Rajiv Gandhi dosen't arise. Because BJP's only target is Congress and Rahul Gandhi. There was no point to go against Congress for 5 years if Congress was really a loser party. Every year and every time, Modi spoke nothing but Congress and Rahul and Sonia. 

An already powerful man, still speaking and squeaking about a failed leader? Why Modi felt threatened always. If Rahul was such a failure. Modi did his job in 2014, removed Congress, it should've been stopped. But then time over again, It is only Modi who brings up Congress and Rahul as his prime topic in Rallies. That's not something a 56"" chested world leader does. It shows how much important Rahul is, whose  every words and tweets were countered by entire Cabinet Ministry of BJP in 4 years. Biggest cause of congress's win: Sambit Patra. It's true. Even hardcore BJP supporters I know are tired of his bullshit.  Privatise gains, socialise the losses. Lol The epic burn that OP is talking about starts at **28:40**

It's an interesting discussion about how it seems to be radical decentralisation but it is not actually because only Rahul Gandhi gets to hear that feedback.

It's obviously because workers need to be protected from their superiors if they choose another CM candidate, but this is a small step in in-party democracy.

However, this is the Cong party's internal matter, and while it's great to increase democratic participation always, I'm just interested in them getting some good things done in the states they have won. And I hope they do something about Vyapam investigations. That blot really needs to be cleaned. > Amit Shah talking about Modi's leadership helping states win election but now that they lost, people can't blame him. 

BJP has now turned into Congress. NDTV is the only ray of hope. I have been hooked to this channel from the day 1 it came into existence way back in 90s. Needless to say, it never disappointed me. While I like NDTV, their potato video quality is hard to watch. On my HDTV, NDTV's resolution and colour gamut is god awful. I get the point of using Samsung phones for street reporting, but are they using Samsung phones in the studio as well? It's a shame that only Times Now has an HD news channel. Lmao I'd love to watch this. Don't forget to update please!  Main toh bas sach bolta hu logo ko babu bhaiya apne aap achi lag jaati hai Ugh Mr. Sinha (the RSS ideologue in the appetiser) is married to my high school teacher. This is disappointing. What a disgrace to logic and reason. I have always admired NDTV. I don't think they are really pro-Congress as the BJP supporters point out.  Arnab does a full pro-BJP campaign while NDTV does not stoop to that level Ravish Kumar vs Chowkidar + Mota Bhai + Kutta Sambit + Bhogi

Bring it on. Best is when Anjana Om 'Modi' in every debate makes space for bjp members..  https://youtu.be/F2z-5jtvyXs

RIL buys 25% stake in Balaji Telefilms for Rs413 crore,46,6om20q,http://www.livemint.com/Companies/bKu1z9YYSqfVqo8HT4N1xM/RIL-buys-25-stake-in-Balaji-Telefilms-for-Rs413-crore.html,7,,Parsainama," Expect free AltBalaji streaming on Jio soon. 

RIL will pump in money to generate content/views. They already have content from Network 18/ Colors that they can redirect to this AltB thingy.

So much drama... RIL needs to be split up into smaller companies. They have become too big and are verging on a monopoly in many sectors. ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**RIL buys 25% stake in Balaji Telefilms for Rs413 crore** 

 ______ 
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), India’s biggest company by market value, on Thursday acquired a 24.92% stake in film and television production house Balaji Telefilms Ltd in a deal worth Rs413.28 crore.

The board of Balaji Telefilms approved the investment by RIL, which will buy 25.2 million equity shares at Rs164 each, subject to shareholder and other approvals.

More From Livemint »

The stake purchase will give RIL access to content generated by Balaji Telefilms for use by its telecom arm, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.

“This investment in content production (including digital content) is in line with RIL’s commitment to invest and grow in telecom, digital and media businesses,” RIL said in a statement.

Balaji Telefilms is a content producer operating across television, films and digital platforms. In April, it launched an ad-free, subscription-based online streaming service, ALTBalaji, with 32 original shows in Hindi, Bengali, Tamil and Gujarati.

“The investment by RIL would be utilized to further speed up content development initiatives, especially for ALT, thereby providing it with a strong ability to compete with other OTT (over-the-top) service providers—both global and Indian,” Balaji Telefilms said in a statement. “Reliance Industries Limited has made a significant contribution towards creating a digital revolution in India by providing high-speed data on handheld devices at extremely competitive price, thereby helping to create an environment ripe for ALT’s success. This investment will give strong impetus to the company’s focus on becoming India’s content powerhouse.”

ALTBalaji has garnered over 4 million downloads across 80 countries, the company said.

This transaction is significant for the Indian OTT industry and is expected to further accelerate the growing trend of media consumption on the go. The number of video-capable devices and connections are expected to grow 2.2 times between 2016 and 2021, reaching 800 million, according to the Ficci-KPMG Media and Entertainment Industry Report 2017. India has about 30 OTT companies.

In 2016, digital advertising contributed Rs7,692 crore and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 30.8% until 2021 on the back of increased spending on OTT platforms and increase in consumption of video online through mobile phones, the report said.

Axis Capital Ltd acted as the sole investment banker for the RIL-Balaji transaction.

The deal will give ALTBalaji a greater chance of success in the OTT space, said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president at Edelweiss Securities Pvt. Ltd. “It’s a win-win for both RIL and Balaji. Balalji will get access to a lot of funds, the funding infusion will help them create better content and increase budgets for both marketing and advertising. In addition they can access the subscriber base of Jio. Reliance, which manufactures the LYf phone, could perhaps pre-install the ALTBalaji app on those phones,” explained Roy.

Apart from telecom, RIL, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has businesses in refining, petrochemicals, textiles, natural resources and retail.

The company ventured into the television and content business in 2014 when it acquired Network18 Media and Investments Ltd, founded by media entrepreneur Raghav Bahl.

Network 18, through its subsidiary TV18 Broadcast Ltd, operates general entertainment and news channels such as CNBC18 and CNBC Awaaz. TV18 also operates a joint venture with Viacom, called Viacom18, which houses a portfolio of popular entertainment channels, such as Colors, across genres.

“This makes Balaji well funded for the next three years to execute its plan on digital video side and Jio’s scale and distribution might would also help tremendously,” a media analyst at a large domestic financial services firm said on condition of anonymity. “AltBalaji could be offered bundled with Jio’s premium plans and lot of other cross-selling opportunities will arise.”

Are you disappointed with the library?,basildoge," The search feature in Prime Video is so incredibly bad that it boggles my mind how a company like Amazon can release a product with it. I think the library is great. Between prime video.and popcorntime, I don't lack entertainment. :) Although the library lacks compared to Netflix, it's a no-brainer at ₹499 with all the other shipping benefits. Although the anime section is a joke and I wish they add more high quality titles  Yeah it kinda is, and to add to this, the censorship.  Love it. Wolverine and the X-Men is an absolute must watch. All the marvel animated stuff is great: Planet Hulk, avenger kids, invincible iron man, dr. strange etc. Apart from all that, Mr. Robot, The Mentalist and good ol' Seinfeld too. None of these titles are on Netflix or Hotstar, so yeah. Haven't used it since I found out about the censoring. 

Free delivery is cool tho  I feel it has not much content but i also use free hotstar and voot for more content. Watch Man in the High Castle on Prime. Brilliant beyond measure. Arguably one of the best shows currently running.. It costs 40Rs a month (and that also includes free delivery from their shopping site). At that price, I am more than happy with the library. If you want more, pay for Netflix. I personally feel Prime Library is better than Netflix. And i dont really care about the censorship. ",Entertainment,2017-03-06 22:44:29
Indian aunties just want entertainment even if it cost someone's life.,140,9fqo93,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9fqo93/indian_aunties_just_want_entertainment_even_if_it/,155,"Personal 

Recently my mother is visiting me in Delhi where I live in a flat. My boyfriend often come to met me here, but my parents don't know about him. My mother often go to talk to the neighbours because she get bored alone. 

Now it come to my knowledge that these aunties wanted to tell my mother about my boyfriend visiting me, and how these aunties feel that I am betraying my mother. 

These people don't know anything about me, my life, or my family. Why it is so hard for these aunties to keep out of other business ??

Edit- This has not happen yet. It is unnecessary to tell my parents about my boyfriend because we are not planning to marry. And telling her will create unnecessary drama in my life which eventually take my life, but I guess those aunty will get entertain. Also, my parents are abusive.

Edit2- Thanks to everyone who has supported me and given me good advice. 
And everyone else who is judging me before knowing anything about my situation, you will make a good uncle and aunties like these people, I hope you don't kill someone with your judgement mentality.
At least have some empathy for your fellow human being. You don't know what kind of hell they have been through.

And those asking what worst thing will happen, the worst which happen is that my mother will beat me, drag me back home and marry me and I will be unable to leave them. I am afraid of trauma it will create in my life.",xxyyccb," [removed] The way you have written I am confused whether this event has happened or will happen. Indian Aunties are the old version of Indian News Channels. xD  
Spreading fake news and propaganda 

&#x200B; > These people don't know anything about me or my life, my family.

This is where you are wrong , kiddo. F Tell your mother in advance that these aunties are notoriously known to spread rumors and not to take them seriously.  Bol na aunty aaoon kya ! There is no personal space in our country. People are more interested in others life rather than their own. Most of the home makers have no job. TV dramas and gossips are their best source of passing time. Gossiping becomes hobby of them. Gossiping is similar to smartphone addiction, an instant gratification. 

Since damage is done then face the truth. 

May I suggest a light and funny revenge like sending a porn magazine or condoms etc, discretely. If your mother goes and talks to them, why should these aunties not reveal what they observe about you? They owe nothing to you and you have not even requested them not to reveal. 

These aunties haven't gone to your mother with info, your mother is approaching them. These aunties aren't posting shit on Facebook or calling your mom with info. How do you expect the aunties to know the internal dynamics of your relationship with your mom? 

On top of it, what do you expect your mom and these aunties to talk about? You are the common factor. They won't be taking about how Brexit is going to affect trade or whether Android is better than iPhone!!!

A good solution would have been to put up your mom on a hotel (claim lack of space or asshole owner etc) and hang out there - your mom will also leave soon because it's expensive. Or show your mom some tourist spots. You get your mom home and go off to your business, mom will be bored as fuck and obviously talk to anyone. 

Also, suicide is the stupidest shit you can pull. It will result in putting your boyfriend and your parents in trouble as well as damaging then emotionally for rest of their lives.  >Why it is so hard to keep out of other business for these aunties?

Because just like your mother they are bored and will scour everything around them for the slightest bit of entertainment. 

Are your parent's the type to really dislike the idea of their child being in a relationship? How will it cost someone’s life? You risked inviting your boyfriend despite know about nosey neighbourhood aunties. I feel you need to come clean with your parents if they get to know about it. Lol they're jealous of you(as they don't get one for them at your age & finally got married).
Any way their mission is accomplished. Give the aunties sweets  laced with laxatives.  Are you a boy or girl?  

 >we are not planning to marry


Well for everyone's sake don't get arranged married either.

I have seen enough shitstorm caused when people marry a stranger right after getting out of a long term relationship. Just know that it is completely OK to smack your parents back if they ever smack you. No one has the right to physically abuse another. So, who died?  I think Chetan Bhagat is trying to get into Indian TV Show scene. So he came and made a post as a teenage girl to gather material. Come on Chetan this isn't done. They are well within their rights to say anything to your mom as long as it's not slander, and its on your mom to accept or reject what they say. May be you should fix your relationship with your mom and communicate things clearly with her? You don't expect your mom to fix her biases but expect confidentiality/privacy from your neighboring aunties? What are you offering them in return? [removed] just one (as in some one) ??? https://i.imgur.com/N7OJVxB.jpg When your mother comes just casually mention that two of these aunties are cheating on their husbands. And they probably know you know, also tell her that they indirectly asked you to leave the place. If not cheating use something more appropriate, anything that'll make you undesirable for them. Rest will fall into place. Call ekta kapoor /s Your written-english is really bad. Tell them that you are having an affair with their husband! I can understand your concern, but as a child you should be more close to your parents. And who are those aunties, they are also a mother of someone discussing in group same as your mother. So at the end, you want to say your mother also want entertainment?? Now if you think those aunties have an old mentality, then what's that which will create drama in your family? 
 I know privacy matters, those aunties have nothing to do. But, that's what Indian culture is, it will take time to change. And doesn't matter you going to marry him or not, honesty should be there in all relations. Otherwise, you will end up in mess. So, better screw the aunties and tell your mom a truth. 
 Don't want to be a douche, but grammar wasn't considered while making this post. It gets difficult especially when reading a long post like this one.  atleast be honest about your relationship with your parents. If your boyfriend does not want to commit to a long term relationship with you, even if not marriage, maybe he is the one abusing you and not your parents. If he loves you then why dont y'all plan to marry. And if he doesn't then why do you call him a boyfriend and not a fuckbuddy ?",Entertainment,2018-09-14 17:52:13
Why are Indian news channels so disappointing,30,6jzpk4,http://m.hindustantimes.com/opinion/why-are-indian-news-channels-so-disappointing/story-cDuiuycQiJDwIV1ZTxmeVK.html,7,,agile_phoenix," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**Why are Indian news channels so disappointing?** 

 ______ 
Recently, a news channel had camerapersons running behind Indian cricketers to ask why they hadn’t worn black armbands during the recent Champions’ Trophy final against Pakistan, in sympathy with soldiers killed in the Kashmir Valley. As a test of patriotism and as a news item, it was ridiculous. Yet, this has come to be expected of Indian news television, now increasingly part of the entertainment economy rather than the information ecosystem.

Why are Indian news channels so astonishingly disappointing? They oscillate between over-the-top studio debates and relatively sober studio debates. There is rarely deep reportage. Documentaries are practically unheard of. Spending on editorial and news gathering scares managements. Preference is given to paying some talking head a few thousand rupees to scream for 30 minutes.

What is at the root of this? Is it the fault of a few anchors? Is there something wrong with us as a society? Are we incapable of producing and appreciating sensible news programming? Actually, the phenomenon has much to do with the business model of television in India.

In the early television age, there was the belief that as access technology for viewers became more organised – with a consolidation of cable networks, and introduction to DTH and then digital platforms – a market would be created for high-quality, niche news channels. These channels would spend generously on editorial content and raise revenue through subscriptions.

Some 15 years ago, however, India decided to impose price caps on various types of channels. Incredibly, this task devolved on the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). As per the TRAI tariff order of 2016, the price ceiling for a news channel is Rs 5 per month. In contrast the price ceiling for a general entertainment channel is Rs 12 per month.

Consider what this means. In theory, the general entertainment channel could be re-running old soaps (cost of content: zero). The news channel would be required to constantly generate fresh content. Even so, the former is allowed to charge more than double what the latter is able to. Besides a general entertainment channel is always likely to get more subscribers. So it is a double hit for anybody seeking to build a serious news channel.

Over time news channel owners have simply given up, and decided to take the route of reality TV. Today, with the sheer volume of free – occasionally dubious and sometimes outright fake – content available online, one wonders if the news business can ever be rescued in India.

The price cap trap has hurt more than just news. Children’s channels in India are packed with re-runs of 20-30 year old Japanese cartoons. The motivation to spend money on quality Indian animation or children’s programming, using graphics and special effects that – ironically – Indian back-end companies generate for Hollywood, is absent. After all there is a price cap of Rs 7 a month for children’s channels – irrespective of whether they telecast a dazzling and expensively produced series on Indian history or Doraemon, an ancient Japanese series, on a loop.

This explains why there is such little educational and knowledge-based programming and so few documentaries on television. Despite India’s rich heritage, a National Geographic type network, in any language, English or regional, is not feasible. Even general interest channels suffer from the problem. In the developed world – the so-called “mature media markets” – news and entertainment channels earn about 70% of revenue from subscription. In India, only 36% comes from subscription. The rest is sacrificed to the advertiser, the mad race for TRPs and the lowest common denominator.

Hence, you have prime-time wars, re-runs of Japanese cartoons, vacuous reality shows and hysterically outlandish soap operas cloning themselves on channel after channel, depending on the genre. India has killed television by legislating the subscription model to death. This is leading to a serious lack of ambition and a curbing of creative juices, since recovering investments is impossible.

Take an example. An episode of House of Cards costs the equivalent of Rs 30 crore to produce. In contrast an episode of Big Boss costs a measly Rs 4 crore. Even accounting for the price differentials in the United States and India, that comparison is telling. The equivalent for news programming is as sharp.

What is the solution? Should regulators and government departments be pricing creativity and what a consumer should be paying for a quality news show – or should the market? Ask yourself that at 9 pm this evening.

The channel will be better served by focusing on developing viewer interest in new shows, Sony Entertainment Television said. Photo: Bloomberg

New Delhi: Television channel Sony Entertainment Television, owned by Sony Pictures Networks Ltd, has decided to pull the plug on its controversial daily soap Pehredaar Piya Ki, the channel said on Tuesday.

Launched in July 2017, Pehredaar Piya Ki was a show about the marriage of a nine-year-old Rajput prince and an 18-year-old princess, and caused much outrage on social media for its theme. So much so that even the Broadcasting Content Complaints Council (BCCC) on 17 August asked Sony TV to move Pehredaar Piya Ki (earlier aired at 8.30pm) to a late night slot, following a series of complaints about its content. It was moved to the 10.30pm slot (Monday to Thursday).

The BCCC is the independent self-regulatory body for general entertainment channels set up by the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF).

The show was repeatedly condemned for the alleged promotion of child marriage. While the show was on, the BCCC had also asked Sony to issue a disclaimer that the channel/show does not support child marriage.

“Effective 28 August 2017, we are pulling off our programme Pehredaar Piye Ki from television. While we understand that the decision to end this serial will be disappointing to those whose creative energies are vested in it, namely, its crew and cast, we (as a channel) are convinced that we will be better served by focusing instead on developing viewer interest in our upcoming, new shows,” the channel said in a statement.

Sumeet Hukamchand Mittal (of Shashi Sumeet Productions), producer of Pehredaar Piya Ki, said that it was a creative decision to bring down the curtains on the show because the company was unhappy with a non prime time slot. “Our story was not meant for a late night slot. Our audiences were not there at 10.30pm, but at 8.30pm. We have mutually decided (with the channel) to pull back the programme. We are working on a new show to come back to prime time,” he said.

Overall, a pulp legal-thriller which could have been done better. Note here.. it was a Monday noon show, and it was house full.  

I will give it 2/5 But 100 crore club the movie makers didn't even get their basic research right? *sigh*.... In the film the antagonist is a crooked arms agent. One of the things he tries to push is the purchase of kilo class submarines. That class of submarines did not exist till the 80s. All they had to do is google. It hardly takes 5 minutes... I  got couple of costumes that perfectly fit the criteria. [This one](http://www.firstcry.com/sbd/sbd-navy-community-helper-fancy-dress-costume-white/955769/product-detail) and if the budget is tight you can go with [this one.](http://www.ebay.in/itm/Navy-Fancy-Costume-Kids-/331143898580?var=&hash=item7dd3444fc9) I lol at the scene where Rustom gave a handbook kindaa document to a jury member and asked him to read it loud so that all can hear in the court.  

Becahare jury members you know, to the average viewer, this shit doesn't matter. keep calm and let others enjoy it.

movies aren't made to be historically accurate, they are made to make money.

it just dones't make sense to hire some guy to make sure that the movie is historically accurate. Point of most movies  (specially indian) really isn't historical accuracy, it's a piece of art and ultimate and probably only motive is to earn money even the indie ones. If you want to know the actual facts, read books or indie articles (mainstream is highly corrupt). Specially, in our country, you will see incredible films get pulverised by films like Sultan. From a marketing perspective, it is just stupidity. Not really trying to defend but Hollywood movies are also consistently inaccurate. It's a movie made for dramatic effect. 

Which isn't to say that I prefer inaccurate movies , I'm with you on this OP.. having said that I don't think things will change. People do not go theatre to learn history. They go there to entertain themselves. I don't get why you are looking for accuracy in a fiction movie. This is not a documentary, and it is not even advertised as one. 

It's a movie which is made for entertainment. You can gripe about of the movie had inaccuracies of plot. This is just complaining about trivial matters. 

This is the same as people complaining about Mahenjo Daro costume inaccuracies. It's a fucking movie made for entertainment, if you want facts watch a documentary or read a book. If you are looking for facts and information in a movie made for entertainment, then you are dying it wrong.  Now do Mohenjo Daro. Other than you, probably noone in the theatre may have noticed it or aware of these. So, doesn't really matter for an average cinegoer. Furthermore, people are not interested in doing the same research as you did once the movie is done and they go home. 

And, why, by the way is it required? I won't call them dumb and not an intelligent audience, but just the way it is. You go, watch a movie, enjoy it, go home, talk among your friend circle, and that's all about it. Why is it worth one's time to research that deeply about a stupid movie. At least, not worth my time.",Entertainment,2016-08-16 17:10:53

I happen to live in one of the worst affected areas. Its like a warzone, except I can atleast die in a warzone. This is worse. My street is barricaded off since 10 in the morning and will only open at 10 the next day or maybe later who knows how long these choots take this year.

Lokmanya Tilak would turn over in his grave if he had one. Probably he'd be appalled at the commercialisation of the festival, the vulgarity, not just of the songs but the people themselves, the slum dwellers dancing on the streets after a night of drinking, the eve teasing, the molestation attempts in the mass of swaying bodies. Is this what he envisioned? Pink Lips( a double meaning song about vaginas) playing on 10000MW speakers at 4am while old men and patients try to sleep or would he prefer the all time classic ""Baghtoy Rickshawwala""? Groups of 10s walking around blowing that 'air-horn' thing that sounds like a shrieking dying animal. The garbage and slush on the river banks and beaches? He'd be fucking happy looking at that wouldnt you say? The nirmalya lying next to a decapitated idol on the beach. Wonderful! So picturesque!

Last year went to one of the main street where the procession passes from. Saw a woman getting groped, my kid got scared, we nearly got trampled, wife nearly fell down and someone nearly flicked my wallet. Thankfully all near misses for the family. 

Unfortunately, the kid and parents want to go back there again. 

So waiting for the drunk slum dwellers to riot all over and own the city. 

However, is it all that bad? 

Maybe that's the only exit and entertainment they get. If that's the price we the highrise dwellers have to pay to let the pressure exit out through  the valve of one noisy night, so be it. If we don't let the poor play their loud and cheap music and do those vulgar gyrations they will barge into our forts demanding their share. Maybe they will force their way into the Coldplay concert and into our multiplexes and clubs. Maybe they will spill our wine and throw away the sushi. 

Or maybe it's just me losing my marbles in fear of the dreadful night.   > Lokmanya Tilak would turn over in his grave

No he wouldn't. He was a politician. He would be happy that the festival is still alive and people are enthusiastic/fanatic enough to do all this shit.

[NP] This is the most perfect review of Happy New Year!,362,2kd57a,http://i.imgur.com/7IFIJFN.jpg,72,,iRahulJadhav," Who is this dude, I see a lot of people sharing his stuff  Guys tell me honestly, is the movie bearable? Majburi mein jana padd sakta hai. :(( So I live in America, and the movie theater where I live usually has one or two Indian movies playing in it because there's a large Indian population at my University.  One of my white friends saw it with some of his roommates yesterday because he decided that he wanted to be cultured and, according to him, ""see what this obsession that you Indian people have with SRK is about"". 

 According to him, the movie is Ocean's 6 with horrible dancing and brown people.   Even if you go to watch these movies to make fun of it, you are still paying them and motivating those morons to keep making these type of shitty films in future.  Makes sense.  First person to truly understand the movie.  Think people need to change what they are judging Bollywood on. It's no longer an art form its an entertainment industry. So our standards for an art form won't hold up. We will have to judge it for its entertainment value not if it inspired one to do anything wonderful with their life. 

There will be films which will be pieces of art. Just that the market has no place for it if you are just a new director, producer, actor with ambition of making money with your art. 

Maybe if you are rich and just want to show other people something you believe in strongly with series of moving pictures. Just don't be a rich greedy producer who wants to make the same thing till you die. For what it's worth, the film received [mixed reviews from about 40 critics](http://www.sahinahi.com/Movie/Happy-New-Year/10d0d36f-6676-4829-95f2-3d1208d76356) [](/hehheh) this guy is soo funny.

Salman Khan in Kick and Akshay Kumar in Holiday continue the Bollywood tradition of sexually harassing their heroines under the guise of humour and romance,233,2ckfg9,http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/features/blink/watch/molesters-or-heroes/article6268105.ece,110,,agentbigman," It's just not this, bollywood's representation of the lgbt community too is very disturbingly clownish. 

Also the fact that every movie has a love story? Can we not glorify only this relationship! My parents are pretty impressionable and I could do with lesser marriage pressure!  > **The cleverest way of appeasing audience misogyny has been to show a woman being ambiguous about her consent.**

Precisely. It's always shown that the girl will eventually fall for the hero, which is why you see every *sadak-chhap* following a girl everywhere for weeks and when she shows no interest? Simple! Acid attack! The sexual harassment is so, so brazen. As a woman, it makes me uncomfortable when Akshay Kumar pinches Sonakshi Sinha's waist while she has no idea what is happening. When asked why, he says something to the lines of ""I couldn't control myself"". This is not only disastrous because people who DO behave this way with women think such behaviour is acceptable and continue doing it, but it makes ""eve-teasing"" extremely trivial. I cannot BEGIN to express how uncomfortable it is to be touched inappropriately, and these movies are not helping simply because they make it seem normal and something that women should just be used to. 

Movies begin with an idiot SEXUALLY HARASSING a woman (I hate the term eve teasing), the woman falling for this man who has no respect for her, and eventually turns into a two dimensional character whose only aim in life is to please the man. 

Not just this, men like Akshay Kumar set this unreasonable and horrifying standard for masculinity. If a guy does not express sexual interest in women (like calling her 'maal' and 'item' {both of which are just horrible things to call them}), they might be deemed as too... Seedha? I don't know. It makes me sad, for both men and women of this country, especially those who are respectful towards both and just want to be treated with respect as well. I am sorry for the rant, but this has been weighing on my mind the past few months, a few things in college also set it off... Saar certain said ""ACTORS"" continue the  Bollywood tradition of sexually harassing their heroines in real life too..forget movies, Bollywood is such a shit hole it will some day turn into a inbreeding farm

Edit: **Just found out the bhojpuri version of baby doll shows sunny leone nude cgi instead of her costume being groped by harry potter ghosts**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEBD0e4Rcnc our future 50 yr later generation will be like -- WTF our grandparents use to watch ! (I like the 60-80s bollywood films) You'd think Salman Khan would know better, considering what happened with Aishwarya Rai. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1u3AEF2kAE) comes to mind. Amazing-I couldnt come up with one good reason as to why I am extremely picky when it comes to bollywood. This article just nails it. I'd like to see what would happen when a man gets groped by a group of women exerting their sexuality on the streets.

Would he be turned on and avert his gaze coyly or would he run, shit scared, to the nearest police station.

Oh the joy! This article just states all the reasons I completely avoid watching Bollywood movies! I don't understand how these even become super hits/hits whatever! We need to have more of these articles. Actors need to stop making such nonsense ""cool"" and ""funny"". Just the other day I lost my temper after reading the jokes based on Hrithik-Suzanne divorce. And these very same people have the gall to tell me than Indian culture is superior to the west due to its modesty and family values!

btw that move of lifting dress with teeth makes him look like a fool. The writer should have seen *Grand Masti* & *Kya Super Kool Hain Hum* The problem in one line : 

>...designed to assure the male audience that they cannot be held responsible for sexual misdemeanours; a metaphor for boys as helpless testosterone-ridden creatures who cannot help themselves when faced with female beauty.  Tv and movies affect us to a great extent and have a significant effect on our nature and behavior. We catch quite a bit and a lot of it subconsciously.  maybe we need the majority average audience to grow up and watch movies with creativity and substance instead of slap stick movies ! The most important thing we need to acknowledge here is the role movies play in our lives. There are people who say this is just entertainment and it should not be taken seriously. But i am very sure that this is far from reality. Because movies or any visual medium affects us in a very very sub-conscious level. For example, think about the amount of damage done by the ""Fairness"" cream ads. 

Popular movies and ads do not challenge the audience. They keep feeding the audience what they want to see. They do not care whether what audience think is morally or scientifically correct. In a year you rarely see movies that challenge the audience and create a discussion among the public. 

That being said, the biggest curse of popular Indian cinema is these ""button down"" hero oriented films. It is an understatement to say that these movies spoil the youth. I am not saying movies should always carry a good message for public. But it should never carry a derogatory message for public. 

 It's all I could think about when I saw Holiday.

Don't as why I saw Holiday, concentrate man.

I don't know why I saw Holiday. :( Telugu movies are equal culprits too. Telugu hero fans are overly protective of their heroes as well. I hated R Rajkumar for this exact reason. It was insane how ""normal"" it was for the guy to stalk the girl. Let's start by[ reviewing this funny PSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxuUkYiaUc8) - which I hope you would agree, has a lot of truth in it.

When it comes to cavorting a female, the fine line between ""creepy behavior"" & ""romantic acts"" blurs. It all depends on how the lady perceives the guy - if the guy is cute, then writing letter in blood is romantic. if the guys i not cute, then the same act is creepy.


 Heroines in such movies is more of a showpiece and does not add much to the story (if there is any). Entire focus is on the Hero. Target audience is young male crowd (mostly thirsty) who wants to believe that stalking a girl will win her consent. I usually avoid going to Halls for such movies. Movies or pop culture in general only reflect the society in which they are made. They are made to make money entertaining public, not to preach values. It's the public that finds the movies amusing. It's depressing to think like we are uncivilized savages, but it's true. Difference between movie and reality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL3k5NtBUaI So Jai was not harassing Basanti? How come that movie is considered golden? 
Its all fun for people who dont get to live the fantasy. You guys are missing the point here. You pay not to understand but to forget the woes that is Indian lifestyle. 
Its embedded in the pseudo culture of Indians. Directors/producers are not responsible for people acting out on their fantasies. Go home. Get a life. Its just Monday. 
 Bollywood is a fucking business. It caters to its audience. Everybody has rights to express their imagination. Of course it is unrealistic to depict heroine falling for a stalker. NEWS FLASH - The stunts and dance sequences of bollywood are also unrealistic. 

If you are so concerned about this, go make a hit movie where the heroine beats the shit out of her stalker or at least files a police complaint.  Boo fucking hoo,why go watch the films then if its sooo bad.Audience is just as much as responsible for this bullshit as much as the assholes who make this.I gave up on Indian entertainment a looooonnnnnnnnggggggg time ago and YOU SHOULD TOO. What's with you and Bollywood, OP?!

:D Let me try to act Devil's Advocate for a minute and present a contrary view point to the popular opinion here.

Salman Khan or for that any other film star is an entertainer by profession. No part of him ever signed to be the moral protector of the society. Instead he has a fairly simple brief (or if I may say Karma) to do whatever in his power to entertain his audience (not you but his audience). Expecting him mix two roles of an entertainer as well as an educator will always be a plan drought with logical infallicies. He (and most of his ilk) is very likely to over seed the draft and often end up spreading messages that are overall detrimental to the society.


But there is another institution that is made entirely to check exceeds like. Yes, you guessed it right: the great indian censor board. At this point you might be saying that its a broken down system that acts on its own whims. Here I will agree with you. So instead of the focusing our energy on why Salu who in my opnion is doing his job, I think we should be discussing why the system is wrong and what we should do to mend it.


The essence of my comment is that issues like this have been existent since the art of marketing was invented. And debates like this (Fair and Lovely, Honey Singh, Poonam Pandey, Coke, ITC) will continue to exist. However, we will never be able to meaningfully resolve it unless we see the separation of  two roles. This insight has helped me complete an education (you guessed it right: marketing) and get a job without being destroyed by a moral conflict of my own ,and I hope this will give peace to you aswell.

I can continue to rant about how despite of antics like this, Salu can even be a good philanthropists with being human, but lets leave that for another day.
  Bhai ne lagai randia ke jholewalon ki gand me mirchi! Admit it guys!! SRK movies may suck for a lot many, but heroines get proper respect and valuable screen presence in his movies, be it Swades, Chak De India, Chennai Express or any other flick Big deal. The problem with todays people is they try and demonize anything male centric and feminize everything  I refuse to comment on bollywood which is some 100 crores worth.Even shitty movies in hollywood is 1300 crores profit.Take that dirtbag third world Indians.

Graphic India makes digital comics and animation content in partnership with celebrities and animators including Stan Lee, Amitabh Bachchan and Grant Morrison.

Bengaluru: Graphic India Pte Ltd, which creates comic characters and stories for digital and mobile platforms, has raised $5 million in a round led by Liquid Comics LLC with participation from other investors including Start Media LLC, 3One4 Capital, Julian Farrior, co-founder of Backflip Studios Inc., and Neeraj Bhargava, founder of Zodius Capital.

The start-up will use the funds to launch its animated characters in international markets as well as expand into TV/film distribution and virtual reality content.

The company currently makes digital comics and animation content in partnership with celebrities and animators including Stan Lee, Amitabh Bachchan, Grant Morrison, S.S. Rajamouli, and Arka Mediaworks.

It has developed fantasy characters and shows including Chakra: The Invincible, Astra Force, Baahubali: The Lost Legends, 18 Days: The Mahabharata, among others. These shows are streamed on portals like Prime Video and YouTube, and on TV channels like Disney and Viacom18’s Colors.

In addition, the company also has a large library of digital comics and short-form content featuring stories and characters such as Shadow Tiger, Avatarex, Reincarnation Man, Mighty Yeti, Devi, The Sadhu, Ramayan 3392AD and many more.

Graphic India was founded by Sharad Devarajan and Liquid Comics. It previously raised funds from CA Media, the Asian investment arm of The Chernin Group, and from Start Media LLC.

“Our mission at Graphic India is to create characters and stories that are uniquely Indian, but entertaining and inspiring to audiences around the world. India has the world’s largest youth population and its time it shared an equivalent portion of the annual multi-billion-dollar character entertainment industry,” said Devarajan, chief executive officer of Graphic India in a statement.

“As they (Graphic India) move into live action and virtual reality, Graphic will continue to lead India’s character entertainment industry with multi-platform superhero properties,” Rajesh Kamat, co-founder of Graphic India added.

Over the past few years, independent content creators like AIB, The Viral Fever, East India Company, and ScoopWhoop have attracted large audiences on social media and streaming platforms like YouTube and Facebook. The Viral Fever had raised $10 million from Tiger Global in February last year.

Dibakar Banerjee, Zoya Akhtar, Karan Johar and Anurag Kashyap join hands for
Netflix’s Lust Stories.

After the success of Bombay Talkies, directors Zoya Akhtar, Karan Johar,
Anurag Kashyap and Dibakar Banerjee will be joining hands once again for a
film, but this time it’s for Netflix.

The new Netflix original film titled Lust Stories will be produced by Ronnie
Screwvala. The film stars Radhika Apte, Manisha Koirala, Vicky Kaushal, Bhumi
Pednekar and Kiara Advani and will be available on Netflix from June 2018.

Talking about Lust Stories, Karan Johar said working on the film was a
satisfying experience. “A theme of lust….a new age and dynamic platform…the
company of prolific filmmakers…the vision of Ashi Dua and Ronnie Screwvala
made this experience immensely sexy and satisfying! (no pun intended)…Lust
Stories breaks ground and even tears the envelope at times! This one is worth
the price of a subscription,” he said.

On the same, Anurag Kashyap remarked, “The opportunities that a streaming
service such as Netflix provides to creators are unparalleled, with the
freedom to execute our vision, reach new audiences in 190 countries and tell a
memorable story. As audiences move towards enjoying entertainment online, I’m
delighted to play a part in welcoming this shift in India.”

“Viewers today demand freedom in how they consume entertainment and since our
stories have evolved to reflect modern sensibilities, so should the medium.
It’s very exciting to make my Netflix debut with this film, and I can’t wait
to see how a world audience receives it,” Zoya Akhtar said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Dibakar Banerjee added, ”I feel incredibly lucky to be in this
film, in this company, and the fact that this will be seen by people who want
to see films with subjects and treatment like this. I already feel a lot
smarter, cooler, and maybe more honest. Something traditional theatricals do
not make you feel any more”.

In February, Netflix released Vicky Kaushal and Angira Dhar starrer Love Per
Square Foot which was also produced by Ronnie Screwvala.

Why Bollywood and Hindi are no longer the face of Indian entertainment,71,99y1fg,https://www.livemint.com/Consumer/tOTgINhf6NlH4QQn6E9N8N/Why-Bollywood-and-Hindi-are-no-longer-the-face-of-Indian-ent.html,72,,ponniyin_selvan," Currently 

Bollywood = plagiarism 

It copies story from everywhere 

 I hate the fact that we are putting Indie/non Bollywood entities at a higher pedestal when even though their industry have regularly delivered piss poor movies. The more content that is put out the better it is for advancement of Cinema Bollywood is more like Punjab's films industry. Same with so called Hindi songs, they are more like Punjabi songs. it's the simple math of lack of risk taking, self censorship and a general lack of understanding for an India outside South mumbai. Bollywood has a trench mentality. if they find a good formula then they will stick to it until its stale. plus, the other regional films tend to an audience in regions more developed (i.e South India, gujarat maharashtra etc) which means they have an appetite for more creative stories  We need a new base for pan Indian cinema. Bollywood nowhere represents that pan-Indian tastes and culture. Even when they explore some new cultures or regions, they do so through cliches and prejudices. We need a new wood that is separate from all the woods of India and produces content that's more pan-Indian, away from all the muck and filth of Bollywood. I have stopped watching Bollywood movies for ages, I think regional language movies and English language movies by Indians are far superior. Nowadays they are getting technically better as well. 
Bollywood will keep making most money though, they have certain fan following in India, they are hardcore fans who will watch anything  their favorite star appears in.

I am just curious, what will happen when Khan's of Bollywood retired. I don't think so any new stars will reach that much fan following. May be then they will start making better movies It's common sense to prefer content in mother tongue. It's how Tamil Nadu, Africa nations and  European countries work. Glad other Indian states are waking up  Golts are a major reckoning force. They also tend to be the ones that emigrate the most (probably after Gujjus). Since Gujarat does not have a vibrant film industry, it was inevitable that Gollywood(?) was going to put out one blockbuster at some point and then get the $$ flowing, thus setting a trend.

Bollywood has had decades of exposure, and I am really glad where they are going - with indie/art house/foreign collab movies. There have been some good ones of late.

Not to mention, classy TV shows like *Sacred Games*.

It's an escalator and everyone is going up.",Entertainment,2018-08-24 22:50:05
Can anyone review this city plan of mine and point out if this city is feasible?,20,4ojliw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4ojliw/can_anyone_review_this_city_plan_of_mine_and/,22,"Hi,  I hate our country's bureaucracy and  the haphazard way the cities are planned here,  so a model city has been lingering my mind for sometime.  though this can never be a possibility but still a man can imagine. So could you guys go through this "" plan"" of the city and see if it's a feasible city plan? 
A. The City will be divided in 3 parts - residential ; commercial  and industrial ; and entertainment 
B. Maximum are would be given to commercial area 
C. I would hire the farmers from whom I.am.buying this area to build this.city so that they can too get a job.  
D. There would be a small artificial lake between the three parts.
E. The residential area for the blue collared job would be in the suburbs of the city 
F. I would make the city somewhere in between lukhnow and Delhi. 
G. Musical events and other entertainment activities would be held in the entertainment part of the city.
I. Water harvesting plants would be made compulsory from the very start for buildings having a buildup area of more than the pre specified area 
J. Roads would have small inlets holes on the edge of the road which would be covered so that only water passes through,  these water inlets would directly link to a water tank for rain harvesting 
K. Subsidy and free services would be offered to businesses to motivate them to come here. 
L. I would call the best city architects to plan the residential and commercial parts of the area 
M. I would design the entertainment part in such a way that it becomes a tourist hub ( taking cues from Las Vegas and pattaya) 
 And many other things,  which are not possible as I will never become a cm or ias,  but on paper atleast,  would a city like this work? 
Would bifurcation of the three area work or further create confusion and traffic?",Shaktiman1339," Generally the concept of separate zoning has fallen out of favour, and is dated. It gives rise to ghettos and requires people to commute long distances for everything.

People have realized that Mixed zoning is the way to go.  Except for polluting (sound, light and air) entities everything should be close by. 

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to walk to office? Wouldn't you like if you had a supermarket close by so that you could get things easily? Wouldn't you love to have a nice garden close to your office so that you could go for a walk in the woods in your lunch break?  Edit http://www.skyscrapercity.com/

there's some site called skyscrapper city or something like that for discussions regarding such topic very good site First of all, kudos for thinking up of something like this. 

I would recommend you start with the basics first - go through what has already been done before you, which have all been studied extensively, and picked apart so you can read its critiques. 

A good start would be the [Garden city by Ebenezer Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_city_movement). It followed a similar planning concept to the three part system that you mentioned. 

If you're ready to step up to something more serious, here's a [very informative PDF](http://www.srmuniv.ac.in/downloads/townplaning.pdf) from SRM University's architecture department.  Go play Cities:Skylines - http://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/ I have zero experience in architecture, but have played a lot of simCity and nowadays, [City Skylines](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/cities-skylines). If you are interested in experimenting with city design, do give these games a try.

What I have learnt is that bifurcation never works. It all looks nice at first, but as the city develops, transportation becomes a huge bottleneck and the city stops to a crawl. I had games where a fire got started in one corner of the city and the emergency services were so late that a complete zone got burnt by the time they reached the source. Needless to say I lost. 

Best real world example is Delhi. The North Delhi is dominated by residences, while all the commercial activities happen in NCR (south Delhi mostly, gurgaon, noida). So everyday, thousands of vehicles are undertaking 30km+ journeys to reach their offices, clogging up the roads. This is so bad that my travel time can range from half hr to 2 hrs depending on the time of day.

I feel [mixed land use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-use_development) coupled with one-day renting is the best way to go. By one day renting I mean the process of looking for a flat to successfully living in it should happen in a day. Right now I there is so much mistrust and process involved that people will rather travel for 3-4hrs everyday(!) than just move near their offices.
 Kudos on thinking up these things. BUt there are some gaps in your city plan. 
1. Where are the green spaces? Parks? Entertainment centers are commercial answers for community living - Where will thr be plazas, open spaces for people to meet and mingle. Please accomodate that. 

2. You need urban forests - big chunks of greenery as carbon sinks, otherwise why design a new city - just live in Delhi. 

3. maximum area if given to commerical areas - where will people live and come to work in this 'maximum' areas. In usual urban plans - not more than 10% area in a city is allocated to commerical areas. 

4. Where will your hospital and schools be made? They are institutional spaces which should be designed in advance and not haphazardly placed between commercial, entertainment and residential zones. 

5. If you will hire farmers to do the job - who I doubt will be trained enough to work in your commercial area. Who will work in the fields and generate food/ grains etc? You will increase your food costs aka lifestyle costs, if the food is coming from far away places. 

6. Blue collar workers dont have money to travel long distances and from suburbia to work. That never happens. Delhi govt. tried it and failed amazingly at it. Blue collar workers are always and should be provided housing as soon as possible. That is why if you see townships from 1960/1950s you will always see colonies for workers and other officers of the plant made close to their workplace (aka plant). 

7. Between lucknow and Delhi? Does it matter?

8. Instead of artificial lake, I would suggest check out the hydrology and the catchment area. Dont be a chennai or mumbai and bring self havoc cause you think you are smarter than nature.

9. Why will you have entertainment center so far - Imagine the number of trips people will take over the weekend and some evenings - Why would people travel so far to see things. Entertainment centers should be distributed across the city to ensure not one place gets all the traffic and congestion. 

10. on a different note - where will you make your stadiums ? sports complexes?

11. Water harvesting point is good but I am not that well versed with the whole science but you cant just connect water from different sources. 

12. Subside and free services for businesses? How will you make money if they all get this kinda tax holidays? Who will pay for these subsidies and free services? Why would residents not get it? 

13. You dont need best architects - you need urban planners to plan residential and commercial parts of the city. 

14. Tourist hub for entertainment - Good stuff 

Instead of all this, its better to plan transport solutions - Thats what causes congestions, jams and pollution. 
 you're recreating medieval town planning with different villages/areas for people of different profession diagrams needed saar are you planning to take up urban planning in college? Working on your blueprint, I would make it in concentrics with entertainmet at core, residential in middle and industrial in outer circle. The outermost circle will further have multiple entertainment nodes for future growth into suburbs and rurban areas.
All this tied up with sustainaible neghbourhood and transit oriented planning. I would add forestry land  somewhere too. Having commercial only area doesn't work as I have heard that BKC although very good becomes haunted after office hours because it is commercial area and there is hardly anyone to roam around streets after office hours. So in next phase of BKC they are planning to have mixed accomodation including entertainment and may be some housing. Reminds me of playing SimCity 3000.

Which is the most absurd movie you have seen so far? What made it so absurd?,29,2ock7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2ock7t/which_is_the_most_absurd_movie_you_have_seen_so/,100,,blackswan_infinity," No smoking,  it's one of my favourites.  Gunda. It's like Mahabharata. It's a poem and an epic. Jaani Dushman (the remake). What a shitty movie, man! Too much wtf happened. The Pretentious Movie Reviews has done a great job of explaining what that movie was.  Gunda : A movie so good, its not a movie. Its, its magic. 

[For those who havent seen it, watch it guys.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYd2XcIxGBk)  Ra.ONE

Train starts at Borivali and reaches CST station. After that, Azad Maidan turns into Virtual Reality playground.  [](/jackieeeee!) mai prem ki diwani hoon [Baaz: A Bird in Danger](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349115/)

One of the IMDB plot sumamries:
>In small town Nainital, Northern India, there are killings taking place. All of these killings are of women of stunning beauty, and then there are three men. One is Mayor Jaisingh Dabhral; the second is Inspector Harshvardan; and the third is no good slacker, Raj. The problem is that one of these three is a serial killer.... How come no one mentioned 'Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron'! It was one absurdly fantastic movie well ahead of its time and had some really really amazing social commentary. It becomes even more absurd when you know it was partly financed by the government through the National Film Development Corporation. Can you imagine such a film being financed by the GOI now? 

 If somebody says 'Gunda', God will destroy them in great fury. That movie is a classic.. it is not a bad movie. It takes art to make that kind of movie and director is a true artist. I will leave out the obvious shitty ones and say Rockstar. I had no fucking clue what happened to Nargis Fakri during the last 45 mins, and then boom, she dies or something and we see her floating among bright lights and shit.  For me, the movies Happy New Year and Entertainment were a disaster to watch. 

I had to stop Entertainment 15 mins into the movie as there was so much overdose of nonsense in that movie especially the overused PJ (blah blah hun kya?).

Happy New Year was so full of plot holes that it didn't seem like a revenge plot movie but more of a comedy movie. Avatar - What is the point of the movie? 

The same story has been going on since 1940's ... Bad people want land from poor people ... to mine for gold/diamond/riches ... one hero rises among them and saves the poor guys ... 

Same story, done in a different planet. Jhoom barabar jhoom.... Entire movie was absurd. Surprised nobody mentioned - Humshakals Ek Tha Soldier

The Return of Ghajini

Aaj Ka Naya Ready

Fighterman Singham

Godzilla Mere Saathi

Main Hoon Bodyguard 

Main Hoon Wanted

I like watching set max only. Any 70's 80's movie in which a girl gets raped and the only way left is suicide.  Oh my god, its better to ignore this question, instead of going back to recall all those giant turds floating in an inexhaustible cesspool called  Bollywood. An hour and 20+ comments later, nobody has mentioned Said Khan yet. All his movies qualify  as absurd to me. What's the most absurd thing? People like Said Nadiadwala still fund these shitty movies. by absurd do you mean absurdist movies, or just really pathetic ones?  It is a list of absurd movies, not bad movies.

For me, it is ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Mullholand Drive"". Can somebody explain me what the hell was going in this movie?

I also didn't enjoyed ""Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" during first time viewing, but ""got it"" on second viewing. The Human Centipede. Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gum

Never got over that nauseating background score. Still haunts me. Me and my friend went to chennai express and came up with the only possible theory that will make sense.... [here](http://randompillow.blogspot.in/2013/08/chennai-express2013.html?m=1) we talk about it.... 

Edit: Fixed braces.. Aar paar the Judgement day, the ending is out of this world I think OP asked for absurd movies, not tosh by Sajid/Farah Khan camps. I think Om Dar Ba Dar should qualify, also in Malayalam we have Guru and Devadoothan - mindfucks involving Mohanlal.

EDIT: Wait.. Have i mentioned [Sreekrishna Parunthu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sreekrishna_Parunthu). The classic featuring Mohanlal with lot of desi sax... Kisna... Hola? its [Lohaa ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4WOjpQRWwE) for me. A dirty shame.  Gangs of wasseypur, because it was actually good. Om-dar-ba-dar
80s art movie which is totally random. It had a limited re-release in bangalore an year back and caught it in a theater. Crazy stuff... Jayantibhai ki love story, and bodyguard.

India’s creative economy needs creative solutions. It is time to either upgrade Trai’s capacity or to even start thinking again of an independent and separate broadcasting regulator,21,719xol,http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/lkrEDDOHWpA7vjS4jEd2PJ/Indias-creative-economy-needs-creative-solutions.html,1,,ix567," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**India’s creative economy needs creative solutions**

A vice-like grip of regulators and regulations governs the creativity of the private television industry in India. Photo: Mint

Sometimes you don’t need to look under rocks to find the objectionable.

The auction for T20 cricket’s Indian Premier League (IPL) broadcast rights, across geographies and media, has amplified the asymmetry in regulatory frameworks operating in the creative economy. The entire issue should also help triangulate a policy conversation between competition law, intellectual property rights and a sectoral regulatory/legislative narrative that has failed to comprehend the dynamics of India’s growing media and entertainment industry.

Star Group’s winning bid for IPL media rights was made via a transparent process. But the voluble protests preceding and following it have their roots in the Indian economy’s enduring legacy of cronyism and government patronage. Even if we move beyond the immediacy of the complaints and try to focus on the larger picture, the state of strife and conflict does underscore the need for regulatory reform in the creative economy. Specifically, it highlights three issues: multiplicity of regulators leading to lack of clarity on regulatory jurisdictions; need to grant supremacy to Indian Copyright Act—which governs creation, broadcasting and monetization of content—over a plethora of other laws and regulations that are stifling legitimate rights of content creators; and, finally, whether the 20th century mode of administered pricing for content produced in the private sector for sale in the open market can still work in the 21st century.

At the heart of the debate is the difference between monopoly over content and content monopoly. Monopoly over content arises when the content creator has the sole right, granted by law, to monetize the intellectual property embedded in the content for a specific period of time. Content monopoly arises when there is only one content producer in the entire industry and can hold distributors and consumers to ransom, which is clearly not the case in the India.

However, the extant regulatory framework seems to be ignoring these nuances and apprehension over content monopoly seems to have engendered systems that grant subordinate status to the Indian Copyright Act for broadcasting organizations, which is in contrast to global norms. Indeed, indications about content’s future were discernible in the IPL auctions: Facebook’s Rs3,900 crore bid for digital rights (for the Indian Subcontinent) trumped Airtel’s Rs3,280 crore and Reliance Jio’s Rs3,075.72 crore bids. Though Facebook eventually lost out to Star’s consolidated bid, the incident demonstrates how digital content is clearly the next battleground and how companies are according supremacy to content. It also brings into sharp relief the question of net neutrality and the role of gatekeepers. This then also begs the question: Is the current regulatory structure, erected to generate societal equity through mandated economic pricing, adequate and symmetrical for content delivered through cable/satellite and through digital pipelines?

The private television industry in India is of fairly recent vintage. Yet, a vice-like grip of regulators and regulations governs its creativity. The key regulatory institutions overseeing the industry are the ministry of information and broadcasting, the ministry of electronics and information technology, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, the Competition Commission of India, the department of industrial policy and promotion in the ministry for commerce and industry, the Intellectual Property Appellate Tribunal and the department of telecommunications in the ministry of communications.

Given the multiplicity of agencies, there is a wide and bewildering assortment of laws, rules and guidelines that govern this sector: Indian Copyright Act, Information Technology Act, Consumer Protection Act, Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, plus a labyrinthine web of regulations from Trai.

Historically, all attempts to establish an appropriate regulatory regime for the broadcasting and cable industry fell victim to political fragility of the 1990s, till the Centre reclassified broadcasting and cable services as telecommunication services in 2004 and appointed Trai as the designated regulator. Occasional attempts to create an independent broadcasting regulatory authority suffered pre-mature deaths due to political uncertainty.

With Trai and so many other agencies, acts, rules and guidelines at play—often at cross-purposes to each other—it is only natural that the playing field gets skewed in favour of those with unequal political bargaining power. In the sector’s infancy, the boundaries were stretched by organizations that employed musclemen and were friendly with political parties. Not all companies were born from this violent crucible, but some of the leading names in media and entertainment rose to prominence from this brutal churning. In addition, as various stakeholders have pointed out, the regulator’s lack of capacity has also led to the current regulatory distortions.

According to the KPMG India-Ficci report on Indian media and entertainment industry, 2017, Trai’s March order on inter-connect and pricing of channels may lead to a decline in revenue for broadcasters and might even result in an increased monthly outlay for many subscribers, thereby defeating the very purpose of the pricing model. Clearly, it is time to either upgrade Trai’s capacity or to even start thinking again of an independent and separate broadcasting regulator.

"In lead role, Yogi Adityanath moves to revive cinema halls in Uttar Pradesh",7,66rzy7,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/in-lead-role-yogi-adityanath-moves-to-revive-cinema-halls-in-uttar-pradesh/articleshow/58306691.cms,6,,swacchreddit," >[CM] called for an “aggressive push by way of incentives” to singlescreen owners to reopen their cinemas by converting them to either multiplexes if they have land or miniplexes. 

Now that tax payers of UP have decided to support the re-opening of cinemas, I'm hoping they will also enforce that only good sanskaari content  (""such as jai santoshi ma"") should be played in these.
 As 709 single-screen cinemas shut in Uttar Pradesh, CM Yogi Adityanath asks officials to plan their revival as miniplexes.

**What do brands buy on news channels?**

Of total television viewership, the share of news in India was 7%, according to data for week 19 from television monitoring agency Barc India. Photo: Priyanka Parasher/Mint

Is it sensationalism or credibility that brands look for when they buy ad spots on news channels? Or do they just blindly follow ratings?

The head of a prominent entertainment channel who has worked at news channels in the past recalls the days advertising on news channels was bought on perception. The perception of being respectable and credible fetched a premium on advertising rates even if the channel was not top of the heap in terms of viewership.

The executive rues what’s happened to news channels. The way news has shaped up is disturbing, he says. There is no semblance of balance or any attempt at credibility.

Media industry experts say that ad spots on news channels are now bought on the basis of channel rankings.

According to Sanjay Sarma, chief executive of strategic branding firm Design Worldwide, “Increasingly, the definition of credibility is blurring and TRPs (television ratings points) drive decisions. Logically, a brand should avoid getting lost in the media clutter and align with a set of channels and programming mix that reflects its own positioning. But very few practice it.”

The focus on ratings, while understandable, isn’t all that logical. The news genre is niche in terms of viewership. Of total television viewership, the share of news in India was 7%, according to data for week 19 from television monitoring agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (Barc) India. Of this, the share of Hindi news was 43%.

However, of the total news genre category, the share of English news, which averages around a minuscule 0.4%, grew in week 19 to touch 1%. That can, perhaps, be attributed to the launch of Republic TV, an English news channel from Arnab Goswami’s media venture ARG Outlier Media Pvt. Ltd and Asianet News Service—Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar’s company, who is also an investor in the firm.

According to media industry estimates, India is currently home to over 300 news channels of which Barc measures 145. Obviously, the news audiences are highly fragmented. So, the competition is intense and news has become a commodity.

News is much cheaper to buy compared to entertainment channels. News channels do not have the same magnitude of viewership as entertainment channels (soaps and reality shows), sports channels (cricket broadcasts), and movie channels (blockbusters) that tend to have appointment viewing. So, while some specific news programmes, like the News Hour (on Times Now), for instance, do display characteristics of appointment viewing, there is usually no fixed time to catch the news on television.

According to Alok Rakshit, president Aidem Ventures, an independent ad sales firm, advertisers see news as a reach builder and frequency optimizer, which means it helps the ad reach more people and can be shown several times. “On general entertainment channels, you cannot have the same frequency of ads spots as it is many times costlier,” he says.

Cost is one reason why news channels are popular. The head of a media buying agency, who declined to be named, says that India is a news-hungry nation and the news genre is very popular with advertisers. “Something exciting is happening in the country all the time and news amplifies the events,” he says.

The genre, however, is crowded and the cumulative viewership of news is insignificant as a percentage of total viewership. “So, competition is intense and channels go into hyper mode and get involved in a game of one-upmanship,” he says, adding that to buy spots on news, advertisers look for viewership, the buzz around a channel and also the response they get from ads aired on the channel.

Does credibility matter?

“Advertisers are not any different from viewers. Some shy away from sensationalism while others say ‘this is popular with the masses’ so we must advertise. There is no one view on what is good or bad. Besides, credibility is subjective,” he feels.

Samit Sinha, brand expert and managing partner at Alchemist Brand says that sensationalism blurs the line between news and entertainment, which makes media owners feel that the more sensational the news becomes, the more share of eyeballs it will seize from entertainment genres resulting in higher viewership. “That’s why we find a lot of news programmes have morphed into theatre, with Arnab Goswami as its most conspicuous exemplar.”

That might turn away some advertisers, he admits, but ultimately, viewership numbers will prevail.

is out. The film directed by Zoya Akhtar and produced by Farhan Akthar and
Ritesh Sidhwani's Excel Entertainment will hit the screens on February 14,

but in the first look they look really sad. Ranveer Singh looks drastically
different from his ""

Ranveer doesn't look menacing

. Alia Bhatt also looks quite different from her recent onscreen appearances.

_Gully Boy_

as a ""great underdog story."" He told IANS: ""This is a story that means a lot
to me. To tell a story of the youth from the streets of Mumbai, who live a
very tough existence and have a lot of battle to fight and they in the battle
of life they come out and triumph. They find their inspiration through music
and art. The music that is socially relevant. So, it was important for me to
also give a platform to all this new talent,"" he said.

Ranveer said that

_Gully Boy_

is ""one of the most closest to me after

_Band Baaja Baaraat_

because

_Band Baaja Baaraat_

was my first film.""

__ Comments

Which is the best Indian Airline?,6,59q1lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/59q1lb/which_is_the_best_indian_airline/,15,"Hi /r/India 

I'm from Europe and I visit your country next week for the first time in my life. How come? First of all, I'm a huge fan of traveling (especially to Asia), second of all I am invited! Yes! An ex co-worker of mine with Indian descent is marrying and I am going to be there to see it (in Jaipur). Owww yeah!

Before doing that I am going to travel through your country (by train and bus) and on the end of my 12 day trip on the mainland I want to visit the Andamans. And this is the reason of this thread.

There's plenty of options to get there by air. Since apperently your country has a great choice of airlines, I am a bit overwhelmed. First of all Air India is probably no option, because it's too expensive. But then there are plenty of other options with a similar price range: 

For my date, the cheapest is Jet Airways. Followed by Spicejet, Go air, Visatra and IndiGo. Costs are between 13.000 and 26.000 Rs for a roundtrip from New Delhi.  

Obviously I am tempted to just take the cheapest offer. But what's more important to me is safety, maybe good food and onboard entertainment. But mostly safety. 

Do you have any suggestions? Which one do you think is best? Which one's your favorite? 

Thanks a lot, and I am really looking forward to visit India!

**TL;DR:** Got a cheap flight with Jet Airways. Is there a better airline that is worth a few extra Rs? ",altbekannt," Here's my experience:

Jet Airways > Vistara > Air India  [deleted]  
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2134 
 > Check out /r/indiaspeaks if you are interested in a friendly and open place to discuss about India. Other places are unfortunately too corrupt to hold an unbiased discussion anymore.  Go for Jet Airways Take indigo. They are mostly on time. Other things like inflight entertainment does not matter in india because pretty much all the routes are <3 hours. SpiceJet, GoAir and IndiGo are LCCs. (No complimentary F&B, mainly).

Among them it would be IndiGo > GoAir > SpiceJet. Choose based on price, they're all fine.

If you want a full service airline, Vistara > Jet. Jet is VERY good internationally but their domestic planes are old and I actually prefer flying LCCs than Jet in India.

So overall, Vistara* > IndiGo > GoAir > Jet* > SpiceJet. (Ignoring F&B).

Choose Vistara only if you care about inflight entertainment or free food. Honestly the Rs. 5000 extra is better spent on buying whatever food you want (which will be ~Rs. 1000), on an LCC. >For my date, the cheapest is Jet Airways. Followed by Spicejet, Go air, Visatra and IndiGo.

You should take Vistara.

 None of these airlines have in flight entertainment for domestic flights IIRC. Air India is a shit airline even when I fly international. It will be a horrible experience in domestic. 

Out of these, Jet and Vistara serve food. Vistara's offerings are better than Jet.

 jet, vistara and air India are full service airlines. the rest are no frills low cost.  

my personal recommendation: jet airways   Indigo. They are super cheap and utilitarian, but also the most reliable airline in India. Air India should be your last option. Another recommendation for Indigo. Most reliable by far, I never take anything else if I can help it Go for the jet airways, it's better than most other providers",Entertainment,2016-10-28 03:42:02

"God doesn't need loudspeakers, then why do we? [NP]",86,2f39hc,http://imgur.com/UmxkFA7,40,,scribetribe," [deleted] religion is a propaganda, loudspeakers needed to propagate it Sir , off topic may be because I too want to ban these loudspeakers but earlier while doing Katha or puja ,Shankh was blown for the same purpose as loudspeakers . The place that I come from Uttrakhand people use to play huge trumpet like things to make people aware . i think its got a lot to do with the fact that most of these events are mass mobilization plans for political outfits. Translation - Make the most noise and the crowd follows you. Young people are attracted with DJ style trucks with pumped up volumes. Anything less and its like ""woh feel nahi aa rahi"". ... i think this is a phase and this too shall pass. 

and impo i dont think dancing to bollywood numbers is strictly for non-religious ocassions only. I mean Ganpati doesnt care whether you dance to a bollywood number or not as long as youre celebrating and having fun. Its the emotion that counts. To me, the guy who dances all the way at a ganpati procession is as much of a disciple as is the guy who wears the dhoti and chants the sholkas... different ways of expressing yourself. Please also tell this to the mullahs.  Haha the media thinks its so smart with this bs.  Simple because we are not gods, we don't have to really bother about what bothers the others. We can be loud in expressing our happiness while giving a damn to the inconvenience to others.",Entertainment,2014-09-01 00:06:22

**A brief and crackling history of fireworks in India** 

 ______ 
Crackers and fireworks up to nineteenth century India were probably quite expensive and hence commissioned mainly by the rulers for personal and citizen entertainment or by the economically well-to-do of the community.

Fire, in author and historian Jack Kelly’s words, “ignites our dreams and anxieties” and speaks to humans “in a language more basic than thought”. Not only sacred and formidable, fire is also enduringly entertaining in its pyrotechnical avatars. It is little wonder thus that a festival of lights (flames) and a night of fireworks is continually enchanting across the world. The contribution of firecrackers to air pollution, at a time when they are fairly affordable and readily available in India for all to use, raises the question as to how far do firecrackers and fireworks really go in Indian history and how their availability and consumption has changed over time.

“The use of fireworks in the celebration of Diwali, which is so common in India now, must have come into existence after about 1400 AD, when gunpowder came to be used in Indian warfare,” stated late historian P K Gode in his account, “History of Fireworks in India between 1400 and 1900,” published in 1950.

Fireworks, like its primary ingredient Gunpowder, have a long history in India. Gunpowder — the accidental tenth or eleventh century invention of medieval Chinese alchemists — was early on dubbed as “devil’s distillate,” as it terrified and fascinated onlookers with its flash and bang. As its military use evolved in China, so did its show and gimmick value — right from the white, magical appearing smoke left in the wake of its open combustion. One historical conjecture is that the gunpowder technology, along with the first pyrotechnical mixtures for entertainment, was brought to India and Europe from China by the Arabs.

Fireworks in medieval Indian celebrations

One of the earliest notes of pyrotechnical shows in India is made by Abdur Razzaq, the ambassador of the Persian sultanate, who stayed in Vijaynagar in 1443 AD during the reign of Devaraya II. Describing the events of the Mahanavami festival, Razzaq wrote, “One cannot without entering into great detail mention all the various kinds of pyrotechny and squibs and various other arrangements which were exhibited”. Italian traveler Ludovico di Varthema who visited India in this period, made a similar observation while describing the city of Vijaynagar and its elephants: “But if at any time they (elephants) are bent on flight it is impossible to restrain them; for this race of people are great masters of making fireworks and these animals have a great dread of fire…”

Fireworks and pyrotechnic shows existed as a form of royal entertainment in many medieval Indian kingdoms during festivals, events and special occasions like weddings. Manufacturing formulas for fireworks describing pyrotechnic mixtures are found within Kautukachintamani, a Sanskrit volume by Gajapati Prataparudradeva (1497-1539), a reputed royal author from Orissa. Gode mused on the possibility that Chinese pyrotechnic formulas were brought to India around 1400 AD and then modified with the use of Indian substitutes for the Chinese ones not available in India.

It is notable that Ibrahim Adil Shah, the Sultan of Bijapur, circa 1609 AD gave a lavish dowry in the wedding of his courtier’s daughter to the son to Nizam Shahi general Malik Ambar, “with Rs. 80,000 being spent on fireworks alone,” states late historian Satish Chandra in his well-known volume Medieval India: From the Sultanate to the Mughals. While rulers were primarily the organising sponsors of these shows, it is clear that other citizens also had access to fireworks. Duarte Barbosa, a writer and officer of Portuguese India who wrote some of the earliest pieces of travel literature, described a Brahmin wedding in Gujarat from his travels (circa 1518) where the bride and bridegroom “are entertained by the people with dancing and songs, firing of bombs and rockets in plenty, for their pleasure.” His description, according to Gode, also suggested that the fireworks had been manufactured in India and were available in plenty in Gujarat at the time.

Elaborate description of fireworks in mythological works from this period also bring in imaginations of pyrotechnic exuberance, familiar to the writers of this period, around these epic events. For example, a popular sixteenth century Marathi poem by the saint Eknath called “Rukmini Swayamvara,” describing Rukmini’s wedding with Krishna, mentions a range of fireworks, from rockets to the equivalent of the modern phooljhadi.

By the eighteenth century, fireworks began to become de rigueur in grand scale Diwali entertainments organised by rulers. Peshwayanchi Bakhar, a Maratha chronicle text, mentions a recounted account of Diwali celebration in the Kotah (modern Kota, Rajasthan). Mahadji Scindia in it describes to Peshwa Savai Madhavarao: “The Divali festival is celebrated for 4 days at Kota, when lacs of lamps are lighted. The Raja of Kota during these 4 days gives a display of fire-works outside the premises of his capital. It is called … “Lanka of fire-works”. Mahadji then went on to describe an image of Ravana at the center, surrounded by rakshasas, moneys and a big image of Hanuman prepared in Gunpowder, which upon being lit actually illustrated the scene of Lanka dahan via Hanuman’s tail via pyrotechnics. After hearing this, the Peshwa gave orders for a similar display of fireworks for his entertainment. The resultant grand performance, as per the chronicle, was “witnessed by the people of Poona in large numbers”.

A historical account in Marathi by Rai Bahadur D.B. Parasnis translating to English fireworks in India mentions the arrival of a skilled English pyrotechnician in India circa 1790 AD, who first impressed the British in Calcutta with his performance and was then sent by them to Asafaddanula, the Nawab of Lucknow, whom he impressed with a spectacular, continuous display in the sky of colorful fireflowers, fishes, serpents and stars. In one display, a mosque arose in the sky.

Thus, by the late Peshwa period, when the Mughal empire was breathing its last and the British East India Company was afoot realising its designs in India, not only was the knowledge of different fireworks common, but also many references to Diwali along with accompanying description of fireworks or atishbazi began surfacing in various publications. Often these makers of fireworks were also the manufacturers of gunpowder, the raw materials for which were always readily available in India and which was used in bulk in warfare. By the end of the eighteenth century, however, its military use was phased out in favour of newer explosives like Dynamite. Since then, the medieval technology’s principal use remained in the fabrication of fireworks.

Fireworks in modern India

What generally seems apparent from the sparing descriptions of crackers and fireworks in medieval India is not only their grand nature, but also that they were probably quite expensive and hence commissioned mainly by the rulers for personal and citizen entertainment or by the economically well-to-do of the community. In the colonial era, it is likely that like most indigenous industries, India’s fireworks production and development also took a setback, with imports from Europe and China appearing in the Indian market.

The first fireworks factory in India was set up in Kolkata in the nineteenth century. After Independence, Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu emerged as India’s Firecracker hub, benefitting from the restrictions of imports of firecrackers. It is plausible to theorise that, unlike in the colonial and medieval eras, with increase in the population and economic prosperity of the Indian middle class — especially in the last three decades — and with ready supply coming in from the flourishing domestic industry, bursting of firecrackers only grew and never looked back.

CHENNAI: The Madras High Court today set aside an order by the Tamil Nadu government refusing to increase ticket prices in cinema theatres in the state and directed it to consider afresh the representation by Tamil Nadu Exhibitors Association for a hike.

Passing orders on a PIL by the association, which had sought increase in the ticket prices citing various factors, including hike in the entertainment tax, the court said it was not satisfied with the October 21 last government order.

""Merely to state that nothing has changed in the last 10 years begs the question, as it can hardly be disputed that on various accounts costs have increased including basic aspects like electricity cost D.A payable (to employees), entertainment tax, etc.

""We are thus not satisfied with the disposal of the representation made by the petitioners to government and thus direct that fresh consideration should take place based on the parameters set out by the petitioner and a decision should be taken within a maximum period of one month from today,"" the court said.

The petitioner association had sought a direction to the Home Department (Cinema) to revise the rates of admission into cinema theatres in pursuance to their representations made in December 2013 and November 2015.

When the matter came up today, the Additional Advocate General has produced the government order, which mentioned the existing ticket prices ranging from Rs 20 to Rs 150 based on the amenities offered such as AC or non-AC.

Does the kind of entertainment white people enjoy shock you sometimes?,10,9yn0rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9yn0rl/does_the_kind_of_entertainment_white_people_enjoy/,19,Or do indians pretty much like the same stuff? In white cultures pretty horrific films and videogames have become popular from slasher films to violent videogames a la doom. Do indians pretty much like the same movies as westerners or do you look at something like nightmare on elmstreet or saw and go like how could anyone like this? ,Captain_Resist," In the west, normal life is predictable and orderly, so the movies that white people like is full of chaos and horror.

The reverse is true in India. Life is chaos and shitty, so we like fluffy movies full of perfect rich families leading the perfectly happy life. Yes. I'm shocked how tik tok, flossing and twerking is a thing these days. I can say with certainty that many Indians enjoy gory things, myself included. Lots of Indians play those video games and watch those movies you mentioned. 

Obviously it depends on personal taste. I was shocked by Two Girls One Cup.

scat-fetish!

really!?! No one disses on DOOM... I like Doom. It's an awesome game. Maybe because most of their lives are fine and they want something to release their stress they face. That's how it works for me..  I enjoy video games. Saw, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Cube, etc are cult horror movies with a very limited audience. Most of them are made for their shock and jump scare value, nothing more than that. Kind of entertainment people enjoy should be judged on basis of Box Office hits in the countries. If you do an analysis, it would be mostly- Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Action, Thriller and Comedy. Only 1 or 2 Horror movies would have made into the Box Office Hits list. You can check BoxOfficeMojo Top Movies for reference. Can't speak for everyone here, but horror and slasher movies are my favorite genres among movies. I'd prefer to watch a Romero, Takashi Miike, or Dario Argento movies over the traditional fare any day. It also feeds into my music habits in terms of extreme metal.

Saw the irony ? [deleted] [deleted] You may feel this way, but it is quite evident that you're in the minority. Fairer skin sells in South Indian media, that's a fact. It sells because that's what people want to see. If you want to impose some sort of reverse racism, then you're as bad as the racists.  What kinda BS is this, B/w North India & South India is not different country.


South Indian movies prefers Fair skin/North Indian actress and it's been following for decades. Colourism & racism exist not only in Bollywood.  North Indian and South Asian is not the issue, Shadeism in general is. It's time to shift the conversation and question why so much of our mental energy feeds into bullsh*t beauty standards, defined by present day media. It's not a good use of our time.

I love reddit and probably don't visit any other site. Negligible FB, no twitter. IT support work; no work or useless work which I don't want to do :) I spend a lot of time on the internet, browsing various things. For the line of work I want to be in, filmmaking and graphic design, the more I learn about anything, the more I can apply. And /r/india just for kicks.  Only Reddit and Quora is accessible in Office. All other social websites, sports, fitness and for the fuck sake there is one more category called test less, which blocks some particular sites.

> so much time

What I said above in the **bold** and as the mod rtw said, for me sometimes it actually means 2-3 hours (usually it's 30-40 mins) for compile&build (full module) and then the code-reviews start which take more than compile and build as people take their time in reviewing and then passing condescending judgements on the code you write (not necessarily because it needed improvement but mostly for the sake of it). Then you have to write back to them and if they are senior coders (read 15-20 yrs coding exp) then you gotta wait if they have not approved your check-in (it's not a rule but it's for your own arse's sake lest sth is fucked up by your code) and sometimes their observation is really a gem which you'll not learn in any coding tutorial, book, or MOOC course.

Recently, we were invited to a housewarming party at a shiny new residential complex. The hosts, in their early 30s, had tastefully done up their apartment tastefully and as we sank into the comfortable sofas in the living area, our eyes wandered instinctively to the wall opposite. A Buddha painting serenely smiled back at us from where we had expected to find a new television. The hosts told us that they did not watch TV at all and got all their entertainment online, on-demand. Though we had encountered many people who told us they didn’t watch TV, we used to dismiss them as snobs or as people with selective amnesia. But this incident got us thinking about two questions—if many people we know hardly watch TV, what do they do for entertainment? Second, who watches TV?

Recently, there has been a change in the audience measurement metrics for television viewing. The newly formed agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) has expanded its coverage from 60 million earlier to over 150 million households. This means that the earlier rating system that gave a much higher weightage to urban population has now been replaced with a much more representative sample that covers a large portion of rural households as well. This has had a big impact on the TV viewership ratings (loosely called TRPs). For instance, in the Hindi general-entertainment (GEC) genre, while the top three channels by viewership remained unchanged (Star, Zee and Colors), the next two spots were taken up by free-to-air (FTA) channels that broadcast only repeat shows (BARC ratings, HSM CS4+,Week 27-36, 2016). Also, the viewership share of the top three channels fell to 37% under the new system from about 50% earlier. FTA channels, which as a group used to account for about 10% of total viewership, now accounted for over 36%. To be sure, it wasn’t as if India’s TV viewing habits had changed overnight, what had changed was the sampling and measurement.

The viewership number is the currency with which a broadcaster negotiates with an advertiser and it has now become important for the broadcaster to appeal to a wider audience. Think about it as voting rights being given suddenly to the entire country versus just the metropolises earlier. Just as the election spiel of a politician will change, so did the “content strategy” of broadcasters. Sample the names and content of some of the TV shows launched on leading Hindi GECs in the last few months—Naagin, Vishkanya, Kavach Kaali Shaktiyon Se and Brahmarakshas: Jaag Utha Shaitaan. As one media chief executive officer put it, this genre, “kitchen politics meets supernatural”, was meant to cater to the new realities of viewership ratings. There are other instances of this shift, like 10 channels now playing contemporary Bollywood music with just one catering to English music. Several media houses are now thinking of original content for their FTA channels in order to woo the rural population.

While all this realignment is happening, it is pertinent to note that the rural population is also actively viewing English GECs. As much as 33% of the viewership for this genre comes from the rural demographic and for channels like AXN and Star Movies, this number is higher than 40% (BARC ratings, All India, CS4+, Week 41, 2015 to Week 35, 2016). Whether the broadcasters have rightly assessed what rural India wants to watch is the subject for a different column. As Mint’s media editor Shuchi Bansal observed in her recent column, what this has done, though, is to further alienate the audience that was looking for contemporary storylines and sleek production values. By the end of 2016, India would have 155 million cable and satellite (C&S) households. With the digitization push as well as higher disposable income, this number has almost doubled over the past nine years. Put differently, 72 million households have been subscribing to cable TV for more than 10 years. The medium may be suffering from some fatigue or even disenchantment. The kind of mass appeal that a Kaun Banega Crorepati or the original soap operas, Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii and Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, enjoyed hasn’t been replicated since. While exhaustive data on the entertainment spending of this cohort is not available, we can get some glimpses of where the incremental entertainment spending might be going.

Movie collections have shown healthy growth over the past few years but within that, Hollywood content now accounts for an over 20% share. Who would have imagined that The Jungle Book would outsell many Bollywood movies and easily make it to the coveted Rs100-crore club? According to data from a leading multiplex chain, box-office collection growth for Bollywood movies was 13% in FY16, while the same number for Hollywood was 35%. An ever-increasing number of people are asking for entertainment on demand rather than linear TV. Hotstar claims over 75 million downloads for its app, which shows on demand original content as well as programmes from Star TV. Shemaroo’s content on YouTube gets over 140 million views per month and this metric has doubled in just over a year. Or take Salman Khan’s hit film Bajrangi Bhaijaan’ s trailer, which released in July 2015 and had 11 million views, while that of Sultan, which released a year later, had 32 million. The point being, a significant number of entertainment-starved people are looking for it online and the zest with which telecom companies are looking to recruit new data customers by offering better speeds at lower prices and cheaper devices, will only accelerate this trend.

From an investing standpoint, who benefits from this is not yet clear but companies are experimenting with different business models. This is an industry in its infancy and given the sheer size of the opportunity there is a fortune to be made by anyone who can effectively fill this need gap. While there is excitement in this arena, one hardly finds any meaningful representation of new media companies in the stock market. As investors, we are watching (pun intended) this space intently and feel that the seeds of a few large future multi-baggers are being sown today.

During our time (10-15yrs ago) we actually had to go outside to get entertained. We used to play ton of gulley cricket. And football.

1.For women, it used to be an occasion to dress up and feed their family delicious food, now the new middle class women go out often and can do this whenever they want. 

2.For boys it used to be all about adventure with crackers and having good food, now with their fancy toys, video games and unlimited snacks, crackers are still fun, but not that huge of a deal anymore. 

3.For men, it was a family bonding session, now they just go to holiday spots for that, where do they the same thing in peace. 

Upper class is not as reverent of religion and customs anymore, many rich people are agnostics/atheists secretly.

A friend of mine loves watching Korean Soaps! When i asked her from where did she even find out such things, she told me some of her friends are into it since long. Thanks to Torrents, Subtitled versions are becoming all the rage among a certain type of people. The fact is, Gangnam Style opened the floodgates to a new 'genre' of media entertainment for a lot of people.  And the second most popular, [Tamil films and channels!](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/calcutta-times/No-Amitabh-SRK-films-in-Manipur/articleshow/733398.cms?)

Thanks to [these guys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur_Tamil_community), I suppose well it is true..i'm member of one of the biggest kpop group in India on fb and its more popular than you can imagine..but in manipur it has more to do with ban on Indian broadcasters..BBC even ran a story on it few years back ..
Link to the BBC story:http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11525715 Definitely an interesting article but with the nitpick that just because the K wave is imported does not make it a part of cultural imperialism. The phrase just seemed odd and misplaced considering the reasons why the K wave got popular compared to traditional American hegemony. That's because K-Pop is good shit. No shit, this is what happens when you cast a non-NE actress to represent Kom. Hollywoodesque whitewashing here.  Priyanka Chopra looks daft in that pic. The article fails to make it clear. The gap left by Bollywood is getting filled by Korean movies/serials **and Manipuri movies.** Also, Manipuri movies bear much more similarity to Hindi movies than Korean movies - they have songs, dances, lots of family drama etc. 

When the ban first came out it was done on Hindi entertainment - movies, TV serials etc. Hindi news channels, cartoons etc were/are not banned. When the ban was first introduced, Hindi movies were prevented from being shown in theatres.  Audio cassettes and video cassettes  of Hindi movies (I don't think CDs were too popular  then) were confiscated and burned. Theater owners were in a fucked up situation because on one hand, they were being sent showcause notices by the government for not showing Hindi movies, and on the other, the militant outfits prevented them from showing Hindi movies. A lot of theaters had to shut down, because they had no movies to show.

Interestingly, a lot more Manipuri movies started getting made to fill in the gap. If there is any positive that can be taken from the ban, it is the revival of films made in Manipur. Today, there are a decent number of movie theaters that show Manipuri movies. The quality of course is questionable the movies are made in shoestring budgets (Rs. 5-6 lakh ) and in the digital format. (I'm not sure about the technicalities involved in converting movies from celluloid to digital format, but this could also pose a challenge in showing the Mary Kom movie in Manipur, if it were allowed.) 

As of now, Hindi movies are not shown in theaters but pirated DVDs are available. Also, with the arrival of DTH TV, more people have access to Hindi serials and movies. Its popularity is still limited, possibly due to fewer people having access to DTH.

Reliance Entertainment on Thursday filed a case against self-proclaimed critic Kamaal R Khan aka KRK for leaking scenes from Bollywood actor Ajay Devgn’s movie Shivaay.

‘It came to our notice that Mr Khan was recording the film from inside cinema hall in Dubai and he was posting them live on his Twitter handle today morning. This is not only a violation under Copyright Act and is also a criminal action under Cyber Laws,’ Reliance Entertainment said in a statement.

“We have already initiated legal and criminal action against such illegal and criminal activity of Mr Khan, and also in a process of informing all social media platforms, that if any such piracy takes place on any such platforms , then they will also be liable for the repercussion,” it added.

Reliance Entertainment, the overseas distributor of the film, also said that piracy is a criminal activity and they will take strictest action under law.

The Deshdrohi actor has, however, issued a clarification on Twitter and said, “For your information, I haven’t recorded anything at all. I took a pic of Title \#Shivaay only. @voxcinemas.”

For your information, I haven't recorded anything at all. I took a pic of Title \#Shivaay only. @voxcinemas — KRK (@kamaalrkhan) October 27, 2016

It's my challenge to each fan of Ajay, If \#Shivaay will survive till Monday also, then I will never ever review any film in my entire life. — KRK (@kamaalrkhan) October 27, 2016

If \#Shivaay will work at boxoffice then I will work as a office boy in @ajaydevgn office for rest of my life. It's my promise 2entire world. — KRK (@kamaalrkhan) October 27, 2016

Story started by 9 years old memory and Since last 15 minutes Ajay Devgan Sahab is jumping in the mountains! \#Shivaay — KRK (@kamaalrkhan) October 27, 2016

30 minutes gone and Ajay Devgan sir is still climbing mountains only so I really don't know if he has made \#Shivaay to show mountains only. — KRK (@kamaalrkhan) October 27, 2016

What a great bad film \#Shivaay! \#Himmatwala is \#Sholay n \#ActionJackson is \#MughalEAzam compare to this waste of time, money n energy! — KRK (@kamaalrkhan) October 27, 2016

Let me clear, \#Shivaay is story of prostitution problem in Bulgaria, so what Indian audience has to do with it? Why will Indians watch it? — KRK (@kamaalrkhan) October 27, 2016

It all started when Ajay Devgn had posted an audio recording on Twitter exposing KRK when the latter went on slamming Shivaay.

The Ajay Devgn directorial is slated to hit theatres Friday.

Rahul vs Modi,131,1odaov,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qStXxdRJtms,32,,darconiandevil," Where can I donate money to these people? This will go on my FB  [deleted] How much time before this is removed because it's not an English submission? Getting real sick of /r/india 

There are plenty of country sub-reddits where this doesn't seem to be an issue, but of course /r/india can't live without the unnecessary drama, am I right?  Hilarious  Absolutely hilarious! Thanks for posting this. I just liked/shared a video which basically encouraged everyone to slap me :) 


..& then i subscribed to their channel too !

 I laughed so hard towards the end, there were stares from around the office! HeHe.. upvotes for funny. The only thing is that I don't see many (none to be exact) people supporting Rahul or UPA in general except on TV. Nice video. I will hate the mods if they delete this because it is in Hindi. Even if congress can get the people compare Rahul against Modi, its their win. It is same as comparing Sachin with some average hockey player who is veteran too, but has nothing remarkable. Only common thing being both are ""players"".

Compare Dhawan's strike rate with Sachin or Sehwag, and its a benefit for him. Same goes for Rahul too.",Entertainment,2013-10-14 02:36:59
"Those who questioned the pouring of ghee for a religions celebration, how do you justify the billions spent for entertainment every year?",7,2ikj9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2ikj9b/those_who_questioned_the_pouring_of_ghee_for_a/,56,"Refer this thread from yesterday: http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2ifwkh/gujarat_devotees_shower_55_lakh_kg_of_pure_ghee/

The world spends millions or billions of dollars on Olympics every two years (counting Winter Olympics also). Then, consider all the other sporting and artistic events which happen around the world, which run into billions of dollars every year, year after year, and nobody questions them. How are they justified? Why don't we stop watching movies and instead everybody in the world pool that money to feed the poor?

The explanation is that humans need more than just food, clothing and shelter to live their lives. They need something that appeals to their intellectual, emotional, spiritual aspirations also. For this purpose, humans can and do spend a lot more money and materials than they spend for basic needs. That is not ""waste"". That is what being a human is all about. It is stupid to question why a country or community spends more on non-basic needs when many of its citizens don't have their basic needs met. That would be like asking why India needs a mission to Mars when there are people starving in the country.",swayamsevak," agreed. entertainment is entertainment, whether bollywood or religious. [deleted] Simple argument : Entertainment is draining money , not natural resources. 

With Olympics you're encouraging sports. People tend to get inspired by these events , they get into sports and sport is not bad.

People watch movies. That doesn't waste any kind of natural resource plus they have a good time.

I'm neither agreeing that the ghee used is a waste .. nor denying.  >The world spends millions or billions of dollars on Olympics every two years (counting Winter Olympics also). How are they justified?

Olympics celebrates sport. The host country gains revenue from tickets and broadcasting rights. The athletes win lucrative endorsement contracts. The juntah on a global scale, across all religions, is mesmerized as Phelps wins EIGHT golds in swimming events. It's all GOOD stuff.

Dumping 55L kg of ghee on an idol - not GOOD stuff.

HTFH but I doubt it. Is it a dumb way to spend money? Yes. 

Should people have the freedom to do dumb things with their own money? Yes. kal ke birthday cake on face thread wale, apna attendance do yahan ok. you have given reasons why things are not waste. can everything that leads to pleasure be justified as not waste? or do you consider some acts that are waste? Easy, I can't fry Arjun Rampal in my pan. Though I would like to eat him. He looks delicious. 😍 How much money/employment does Olympics generate? How about the emotional fulfillment gained by spending on the podium, holding a medal in your hand while the band (?) plays your national anthem.

Compare that to wasted milk that could have been used for better purpose. Consider the energy (electrical/heat) spent in manufacturing that ghee. Consider the pollution/emissions associated with ghee manufacture.  Only to support silly superstition. Didn't see that. It's crass and unclassy in my opinion to just waste so much of  something when it could be useful. But there's no law against being crass and there shouldn't be.

It's a matter of degree, really. Sort of like how people who wear a small amount of jewelry come off better than someone wearing a gold shirt. But, that's just my opinion and I'm sure these people aren't upset that I disapprove. My 2 paisa: Religion, as far as i know, is not entertainment. You can't compare the two.  I really don't see a problem with either kinds of spending - religious or entertainment. You can do whatever the fuck you want to do with your hard-earned money (obviously as long as you follow the laws). dude.. so many lives depends on entertainment industry.. you're comparing apples to oranges.. while that ghee could've been used for so many lives instead of just wasting it.. 

In financial terms, Entertainment increases the GDP because products are coming out because of it.. on the other hand, GDP decreases because of that wasting ghee because products are reduced because of waste..  oh yes people yesterday were harping on how its a waste of money how it will feed millions but will themselves spend thousands on movies or buy expensive clothing i wonder how do they justify that.  Simple. It's called using the resources to it's maximum potential. The money and land used for entertainment could have been used to feed and shelter the poor, but it went to the benefit of others. No resource went to waste. Yes, there could have spillage of water, extra fans and AC's running here and there, but that is nothing compared to the wastage of 5.5 lakh kgs of ghee.

The ghee on the other hand went down the drain. The ghee was paid for, true. But the ghee could have fed people. That is inefficient use of resources. That energy could have been converted for better purpose, but we didn't.

And that is how we can justify one and not the other. Now waiting for your argument.",Entertainment,2014-10-08 00:02:07

**GST will have a detrimental impact on watching films in cinemas: Ajay Bijli, PVR Chairman** 

 ______ 
PVR Chairman Ajay Bijli pens down his views on the GST and its impending effect on cinemas.A key stakeholder in the Indian film industry — the government — got its script wrong by imposing such a damagingly high GST rate on cinemas.The GST was a great opportunity to take the film industry — the staple and most innocuous form of entertainment of the Indian masses — to another level. In the near term itself, we would have come at par, if not above, than the best in the world, both in quality and quantity.It was an opportunity to scale up our domestic box office, which, at present, is a dismal size compared to ones in the US, China and even smaller markets. Through GST, we could have screens in every nook and corner of India.Let me explain why I feel a perfect platform that was set for an exponential growth in the sector has now got adversely impacted.I have been in the business of running cinemas for over 27 years and have experienced from up close the dynamics of the film industry in our country.For several years, the entertainment tax regime in India has been disproportionately high, ranging from 20 per cent to 60 per cent. In addition, most states also capped ticket prices. As a result, there was little incentive for the already fragmented cinema halls to improve their offerings.The problem multiplied in the mid-80s with the video boom, with hundreds of cinemas closing down because of non-viability.People reduced their visits to the cinemas due to the novelty factor of watching movies on video. Plus, it didn’t help that theatres hadn’t upgraded their infrastructure. Overall, cinema owners were finding it difficult to keep the ship afloat.However, two things that are unique to India and critical for the industry to succeed remained encouraging — an abundant supply of films and consumers’ demand.The Indian film industry was still churning out the highest number of movies in the world and people here had an insatiable appetite to watch them. The missing link, however, was the conduit that connected the two — a retail infrastructure that was clean and hygienic with modern technology.The exhibition sector needed a boost, as the revival of cinemas was important to resuscitate the industry. For this to happen, taxes had to be rationalised, land had to be provided for cinemas, and ticketing had to be decontrolled. And all this could be done only by the third stakeholder in the business — the government.Since 1990, various cinema associations have made representations to their respective state administrators, requesting for decontrolling of ticket prices (partial or full), reduction/exemption of entertainment tax (which was different in every state) and to tender or auction land demarcated for cinemas. It was important that the land wasn’t meant for general commercial use as these could be grabbed by real estate players.Various state governments understood the issue and the industry tasted some success. A big concern for Delhi was the transparency at the box office where tickets are sold. Some stalwarts argued that the high tax rate was owing to the manual ticketing systems. As a result, in 1995, we received permission to build the first multiplex with updated cinema building by-laws. We introduced computerised ticketing systems that ensured transparency for all — producers, exhibitors, state exchequer and consumers.This was accompanied by partial decontrol in ticket prices and some reduction in entertainment tax at the state level. The first multiplex opened in 1997 and was a huge success.Everyone benefited — the consumer now had a world-class facility to experience his favourite pastime, entertainment tax collections increased despite lowering of tax, the box office revenues increased and the adjacent real estate became prime. Seeing this, other state governments started giving tax exemptions — although for a limited period.The next two decades saw gradual growth. But the growth rate was nothing compared to the US and China. Still, we were finally moving in the right direction.Cut to the current scenario. We are now facing an onslaught of piracy, consumers watching films on handheld devices, and other forms of out-of-home entertainment. The one impetus the industry needed was a palatable GST regime. In fact, because entertainment tax has always been a state subject and some of the governments have an abysmally low price cap, the GST regime was the only ray of hope for the industry.One has to understand that the industry has also survived so far because of its pan-India multi-state approach. Films are released country-wide and exhibition chains are spread across India. If we were to be regional or stick to one state, then any adverse change in the tax regime could topple the entire industry. Everyone has been keeping the ship afloat by defraying its risks in various states.An acceptable GST rate would have brought parity and removed the volatility we have faced over the years. World over, cinemas are hardly taxed more than in single-digit rates. This has helped the cinema industry in these countries to plough back the money into high quality and globally appealing movies.India has the talent to make movies that can woo not just Indians to the theatres, but a worldwide audience. We could have fast-tracked our screen growth, which is the lowest in the world. We have 2,000 multiplex screens and 6,000 single screens, compared to over 30,000 each in the US and China.In addition to the economic reasons, I also have an emotional issue with the GST slab. Why are we being clubbed with casinos and betting, and revolvers and pistols? Is watching a movie akin to gambling? Is the government trying to encourage cinemas, which are embedded in the social fabric of our country, or discouraging them? This high-tax bracket also applies to luxury goods and services. Last year, 2.7 billion tickets were sold at an average ticket price of less than `80. Cinema isn’t a luxury, it’s entertainment for the masses. In one of his talks, Clint Eastwood said that cinema is an emotional art form. Therefore, this step is a huge setback. While we have the maturity of being pragmatic, we do feel let down by this categorisation.

So this might seem like a open and general, but I am curious to see what kind of responses I would get.

What are some of the things that India is known for?",lightxblazer," Culture, Religion, temples, old civilizations.  Indians. 

 1. Food - Seriously. We have some insane amount of variety of food. Each region (i am not even referring to states) has it's own cuisine going on in a way. 

2. Movies - We make movies. A lot of them. In a lot of different languages. 

3. Cricket - We love sports in general and cricket is king whether one likes it or not. 

4. Politics - It's out favorite pass time after cricket. Maybe it's our number 1 pass time.

5. Religion and Religious tolerance - One of the foundations on which my country was built on is religious freedom and religious tolerance. We have managed to do that and we strive really hard to keep it going. Yes, there are problems. Lot's of them. But that foundation will remain and we have a multicultural country with people from all faiths and religions living together. 

6. A Working Democracy and the biggest democracy - Sometimes even i wonder how we pulled this one off. John Oliver puts it nicely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZDYsSOngik


7. ISRO and Science - We love ISRO and we love science. Science and mathematics is something given a lot importance in school and also by the parents. 

8. History - I don't even know where to begin on this topic. It's too damn big. We have a lot of history going back to ancient times. 


As you said, this question is quite open and wide. These were some of the things i got in my head while thinking about the answer. If you want more specific answers about things just let me know or put it in your post. :) Jugaad, adjustment, tolerance & spices. For me personally:

Having nearly all climatic/geographical conditions in one country- from glaciers and snow peaks, to sand dunes and deserts, to mangroves and deltas, to beaches and islands. A traveller can experience all of this in one country. raeps so many different cultures and languages in one country...  rajanikanth!  Happy people in colorful clothes. Delicious food.

Tamil Nadu screens to open tomorrow with no new movies,2,6lmxl5,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/tamil-nadu-screens-to-open-tomorrow-with-no-new-movies/articleshow/59476924.cms,1,,voracread," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**Tamil Nadu screens to open tomorrow with no new movies** 

 ______ 
CHENNAI: Film producers will hold back new releases as cinemas in Tamil Nadu reopen on Friday after a four-day shutdown to protest a double whammy of state-imposed 30% entertainment tax and the GST . The reason: distributors will find it impossible to get prints across hundreds of theatres in the state and foreign destinations, forcing them to target a July 14 release instead of Friday.Theatre owners collectively downed shutters of over 1,100 cinemas as margins would have vanished under the double imposition of GST and the entertainment tax. After multiple discussions with D Jayakumar, finance minister, and chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, a resolution was reached.The estimated revenue foregone due to the strike was pegged at Rs 15 crore. The entertainment tax has been kept in abeyance and GST will apply over and above the ticket price of Rs 120 for multiple screen cinema complexes, meaning the cost would increase to Rs 153.60. For online bookings, the cost would be even higher. S Sashikanth , Managing Director of Y NOT Studios which is releasing R Madhavan-starrer Vikram Vedha, said: ""I do not think anybody was prepared. For us to be ready for launch, the prints needed to go the destinations, overseas ones too. We cannot send it early because the prints cannot be hanging there indefinitely. So, what we are looking at is a release next Friday.""Multiple film industry sources confirmed that the two other movies slated for release Friday Nibunan and Pandigai will also skip tomorrow for release in view of the logistical problem. An official with SPI Cinemas, which runs screens like Sathyam, Escape and Palazzo, said: ""No new Tamil movie will release tomorrow.But, meanwhile, movies that released last week and got disrupted in the strike will get a 're-release' tomorrow."" Two movies Ivan Thanthiran,and Vanamagan will find screens again on Friday.Tamil Nadu's cinema industry was unique in that it had a pricing cap of Rs 120 for multiplex screens, making the entertainment experience cheaper than what is in other metropolises in the country. With Thursday's deadlock resolution, that ceiling has also been breached.Film critic Baradwaj Rangan believes the grandly mounted films with big stars will have little trouble in drawing the audiences but the smaller films with good content may have to do with a longer runway: ""I don't think people are going to mind shelling out extra bucks for hugely anticipated movies but for the mid-rung ones, even if they get good reviews, people might say 'You know what? For this one I will wait for a Netflix' or Tentkotta.""

With the demonetisation decision playing out as a political war in Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was widely expected to attend the Global Citizen’s India event in Mumbai on Saturday, is now likely to give it a miss.

Until Friday morning, there had been no communication from the prime minister’s office on Modi participating in the event. The event organisers as well as the chief minister’s office have so far got no confirmation about the PM’s visit.

The event is being partnered by the state government and it was expected that the PM, who was present for the Global Citizen festival in New York in 2014, would lend his brand to this social platform, which amplifies some of his favourite causes — such as sanitation. Riding on this, the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had also planned to get the PM to lay the foundation stones for two of the proposed metro corridors in the city and, thus, informally launch the poll campaign for the BMC elections due next year.

“With the political slug fest over the demonetisation drive, PM may not want to be seen at the festival that is being headlined by an international pop-rock band and has a host of Bollywood celebrities in attendance even though the event is meant to garner support and funds for social causes,” said a senior BJP leader. “It will only give the Opposition (reason) to criticise the PM as being elitist when many common citizens are still in queue to withdraw cash.”

Last week, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) officials were preparing for ‘bhoomi pujan’ for the metro lines, while the party unit was looking at holding a public meeting at Somaiya ground in Ghatkopar. However, on Friday, the MMRDA said the planned event was not taking place on Saturday.

The Global Citizen India event ran into controversy over the issue of the state government waiving entertainment tax for the Cold Play concert here on Saturday. Social activists Anjali Damania and Hemant Gawande moved court through a Public Interest Litigation. The court, however, refused to stay the event.

The scrapping of Rs 1,000 and 500 notes ahead of the local self government polls in the state is likely to impact the elections, with the unorganised and agrarian sector being hit by the move. The BJP, however, is hoping the drive that is increasingly being seen through a rich-versus-poor prism will end up giving the party dividends in the local elections even if it is at the cost of losing the party’s core trader base.

The Prime Minister is expected to sound the bugle for the high decibel Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation polls later this month or early in December.

We had our fun and all, but nothing is gonna change with what happened in that AMA. What do they expect? Suddenly the media will start asking all the tough questions and wont just feed on the PR crap? And why would they do that? To cater to their audience? Well, the fact is that the average audience of film gossips are not interested in knowing her views on fairness products, rather they would prefer to know what fairness product she uses/recommends. The audience that will ask the tough questions will remain on platforms like reddit and so if anything, celebrities who prefer not to face such questions would stay away from these platforms. Nothing else will change. >One has even filed an RTI seeking an explanation about the road being renamed after Chopra’s father – an answer was not forthcoming from Chopra.

Well, they're amongst us.  Wow. Talk about hyperbole. Another one of those great circlejerks. 

While the roasting was fun, this circlejerk is getting nauseating. Nothing is changing. PR agencies will continue to control the access lines and hence the questions. Infact Modi's campaign should give you a hint to the kind of media we'll be moving towards. Extremely sanitized interactions. The entire cable media has shifted towards that.

[Non-Political] How does /r/india feel about 2 states?,11,23h3tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/23h3tq/nonpolitical_how_does_rindia_feel_about_2_states/,27,"IMO: As a person brought up in a family with 2 states culture IRL this is just a cheap mockery of exaggerated stereotypes in a loud nonsensical lengthy Bollywood movie. Could not even get through the book but was hopeful at least  the movie would do justice to the best kind of love stories in India. The real life issues of  reactions of different family members, difference in opinions, some compromises in traditional value, concerns of extended family and how they come about to achieve a middle ground none of which was  depicted in a proper way. It was borderline racist sometimes without being apologetic even when there was absolutely no requirement for scenes like that. And no, that never increased the humor quotient of the movie which was already as low as the film maker's standards.  To summarize, it  was as if a hollywood romcom was made about interracial marriages where the family of the whites gifts fired chicken to the blacks and the blacks would get them all some guns  as gifts because they are from Texas. 

TL;DR: Exaggerated, stereotypical, racist lengthy movie. Is it the beginning of Chennai express style money making Bollywood formula?",sudbud," Two lead actors who are in movie not because they are good actor but they are children of bollywood.Thanks, I will skip this one. Alia Bhat playing a Tam? Bad casting.  The book was tattichap and I'm assuming the movie is too. Exaggerated, yes. Stereootypical, yes. Racist, probably yes. But the supporting casts performance really pulls the movie through. Went with zero expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Ronit Roy and Amrita Shergil really kill it with their performance. Revathi was also really good. The lead pair had zero chemistry and were boring. Probably worth watching when it comes on TV rather than going to the movie though. Ronit Roy FTW! > loud nonsensical lengthy Bollywood movie

You described 90% of bollywood Bollywood is not known for subtlety. With bollywood you should go in theatre expecting crap and once in while get surprised with a good movie. Dude real Tamil culture in TN is even more cringe worthy then that showed in the book and punjabis are always stereotyped because they are probably the only community in India who dont mind being made fun of. Otherwise it   is a typical bollywood masala movie so dont expect much out of it. Want to lose some brain cells, watch Bollywood.  Are you new to Bollywood scene or something? Or is this a trial piece for your steps into entertainment journalism? Serious questions... because, them entertainment journalist ladies for news channels who can't punctuate their tweets properly are going on world tours every week!  I liked the movie.

The movie adaptation of the book was excellent. They kept is simple and true to the book and didn't ""bollywood""-ize it too much (I was really afraid of major distortions considering precedents set by 3-idiots and one-night-at-the-call-center.) I was also pleasantly surprised by the beauty of South India as depicted in the movie. The living room of the Tamilians, with a pool and a swing is exquisite. Also, the end-scene where they get married in the ruins of a beautiful Dravidian temple is aesthetically very pleasing. The only thing I didn't like was Aliya Bhat. The book specifically says Ananya was excessively fair and had big eyes like a Bharatnatyam dancer (Hence the comment, Ma woh toh mujhse bhi gori hai).

Now, as far as the book is considered, yes, it is exaggerated, but certainly not a ""cheap mockery"". I come from a 2-state culture as well, and a lot of ""stereotypes"" resonated personally with me. I can only give a few examples.

For example, South Indian Brahmins are heavily concerned with getting MS and PhD from USA, and this, being considered ""the ideal"" is unique to this part of India. In Gujrat, entrepreneurship is the ""ideal"" while in Bihar IAS is the ""ideal"" job. It is a reality that when you attend a South Indian wedding, half the invitees will be NRIs carrying water-bottles. In a wedding, a Maami introduced her son as ""Here is XYZ. He's just come from Texas for this wedding"", and the son exhaustingly said, ""Mom, why do you keep saying that to everyone? Kisi ne poonchha kya?""

Another thing which the book brought out was the ""show-off""-y culture of North India with respect to material objects. I have experienced the disconnect myself, when my North Indian friends and family try to ""out-do"" each other in conversations with regard to the money you earn, the car you drive, the clothes you wear etc. I was once heavily scolded by my distant cousin for coming from the airport in a public bus because ""hamaari naak kat gayi"". They were expecting me to take a taxi when coming from airport, because it is more ""respectable"".

> it was as if a hollywood romcom was made about interracial marriages where the family of the whites gifts fired chicken to the blacks and the blacks would get them all some guns as gifts because they are from Texas. 

This is not uncommon. Watch the movie ""Meet the Fockers"" - its about the girl's dad being a macho-gun-weilding-republican red-blooded american and the boy's family being spiritual hippies.

[NP] What was the point of those cartoons?,5,2ru50z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2ru50z/np_what_was_the_point_of_those_cartoons/,20,"I'm genuinely curious. What were they trying to say? I've seen them and others. In the end, I just went away rolling my eyes failing to understand the meaning. It just came across as crass, irrespective of the god they portrayed. It would still seem crass to *me* if it didn't involve any god and had us human plebs instead.

So help me, is there any point to all this? Should I be looking for any point at all, in the first place? I don't care which god or human they draw, I just want to understand it.",jrjk," >It just came across as crass, irrespective of the god they portrayed.

The point of those cartoons was simply to celebrate freedom of speech, and may be even to provoke extremists to a certain extent. 

This is somewhat difficult for us Indians to understand, because we are always worried about saying things that are proper and not offending anyone else. France *celebrates* its freedom of speech and secularism to the point of it being their national identity. its got little to do with the subject, and more to do with the idea behind being ""able to draw and publish whatever you feel like"". 

the french take this free speech thing very very seriously. given their history of the revolution and formation of the republic, they like to exercise this right. it is very culturally oriented, something like say trying to explain intercaste marriages to a person who does not understand the concept of caste in the first place.  Let me clear a big misconception:

CH criticised not only Islam but all the major religions of the world.

Correction: CH criticised all the major religions of France. There are more Buddhists and Sikhs than Jews in the world and I don't see cartoons criticising them.

Also, [almost a third of France identifies itself as irreligious](http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf). So, now you have two sections of sizeable population divided along the lines of weather or not they are religious. So what do you do? You create cartoons mocking the religion of the two thirds of the population for the entertainment of the one third and profit while in the process also championing yourself as crusader for free speech and expression. It's like the point of Salmaan Khan or a Shahrukh movie.   
Making money by providing entertainment legally to whoever finds these entertaining.   I don't understand what the cartoons were trying to prove. What sort of people derive their entertainment by ridiculing a section of society. All this crap about Freedom of speech is fine and I am in no way condoning the kind of reprisal that followed but ridiculing someone's culture and calling them barbarians just shows how this ""freedom of speech"" is abused. amma bana sakte the, isliye bana liya

basically, bakchodi leaking into the real world. then justified by the freedom of press label. Not that isn't important, but the basic intention was to get a rise out of Islamists.

To be perfectly fair, that was just being crass and insensitive. I can understand doing it if it's important to your narrative, like it was with the South Park episode. Otherwise, you're just being a dick, nothing else. I understand the point, no one should 'ever ever be killed over a cartoon', and those Charlie Hebdo cartoonists did nothing to deserve their fate. At the same time though I think there is a very distinguishable difference between cartoons that are making some level of political commentary and cartoons that are solely meant to enrage. Of course one should not be physically harmed over either, but is the latter really making an important statement? Anyone can be antagonistic when they know what someone else is sensitive about.

What I am trying to say is that I don't think most of reddit's Muhammed postings over the past day or so have any political value. They are not the result of satirical writers and cartoonists, but rather edgy adolescents and politically ignorant twenty-somethings who work retail, and think that by anonymously joining in with a few crude and useless depictions of Muhammed that they are somehow fighting alongside a noble cause. It's the typical ""Shock-Value"" being passed off as art. 

They have been doing that for quite some time, not that i have a problem with it. But it's distasteful is all.

Edit: I am not a party to this game of beliefs, as i don't subscribe to any. What is the point of your existence ?",Entertainment,2015-01-09 15:29:39

>* It was expected that the F1 race - by far the biggest sporting event in the country - would lead to a massive surge in real estate prices in the region, with Jaypee directly deriving benefits by building a slew of townships around the track.

>* Despite the hostile economic conditions, Jaypee decided to stick to its plans and pumped around Rs 2,000 crore (USD 314 million) in building the Buddh International Circuit on the outskirts of Delhi.

>* The company further shelled out Rs 197.7 crore (USD 31.1 million) in licensing fee for the inaugural race, as per Jaypee Sports International Limiteds (JPSI) audited accounts.

>* By this time, Jaypee had managed to reduce operational expenses of the circuit, bringing the total cost of staging the event down to Rs 273 crore (USD 42.91 million).

>* Jaypees financial health was also in a dire state and the conglomerate had to come up with emergency plans to reduce its debts, which totalled to Rs 60,000 crore (USD 9 billion) in its balance sheet on 31st March 2014, the latest year for which its accounts are publically available.

NEW DELHI: Reliance Capital, part of the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group, has entered into a Rs. 1,900-crore deal with the Subhash Chandra-led Zee group to sell 100 per cent stake in its general entertainment TV channels and 49 per cent stake in radio business as part of measures to reduce debt.

""Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL), a separate entity under Zee group, will acquire 100 per cent stake in the Group's General Entertainment TV business,"" Reliance Capital said in a statement.

The company would transfer 49 per cent of its radio business, to Zee Media Corporation Ltd (ZMCL), which operates 11 news channels and publishes newspaper DNA, it said.

""The transaction pegs the combined Enterprise value of Radio and TV business at approx. Rs. 1,900 crore (USD 283 million),"" Reliance Capital said.

""These transactions form part of Reliance Capital's stated strategy to reduce leverage and exposure in non-core business of media and entertainment,"" the firm said.

The TV broadcasting business, operated under Reliance Broadcast Network Ltd (RBNL), comprises two operational general entertainment channels -- Big Magic and Big Ganga, and four other TV licences.

RBNL also operates 45 FM radio stations. Besides, it has bagged 14 new licences under Phase III auctions.

""Both these transactions have been approved by the boards of respective companies and are expected to be completed by next year, subject to applicable approvals,"" Reliance Capital said.

""The Board of Directors of Zee Entertainment Enterprises today approved the acquisition of the general entertainment broadcasting business undertaking of Reliance Big Broadcasting Private Limited, Big Magic Limited and Azalia Broadcast Private Limited, all part of the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group Entities through a scheme of demerger and execution of definitive agreements in relation to such proposed acquisition,"" ZEEL said in a statement.

The transaction is expected to close in the second-half of calendar year 2017, it added.

As per the agreement, RBNL would transfer its FM radio operations and new licences to two Special Purpose Vehicles, in which the Essel group firm would acquire 49 per cent stake.

""RBNL shall be transferring the 45 operational and 14 new licenses into two SPVs respectively along with the assets and liabilities. ZMCL shall acquire 49 per cent stake in each of these two SPVs,"" Reliance Capital said.

Moreover, both the companies - ZMCL and RBNL - would have a call/put option to acquire the remaining 51 per cent shares after the mandatory lock-in provisions of the FM radio station licences expire.

[mini rant] Country is heading to the wrong direction.,0,4eg879,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4eg879/mini_rant_country_is_heading_to_the_wrong/,9,"Everyone I think is familiar how fucked up the Indian version of Youtube is andthe bollywood movies are not mostly softcore porn. See : upcoming film ""one night stand""  

Basically bollywood is exploiting sexually-repressed youth of today. The things they do in these movies wouldn't be allowed in real life in India. In my city, people make a big deal even if a boy and girl talks . 

Even network channals are bating people with thumbnails of sexual nature. Something like this http://i.imgur.com/vleNyE6.png. 

I bet you a thousand dollars most people clicked that video thinking it was a ""desi porn"" . It's so disgusting.

I feel sorry for thousands of girls whose private videos are being uploaded daily on xvideos and similar sites.  What are the odds the girl being filmed consented to  have her videos being disturbed on the internet ? One in a thousand maybe. It's a sad state of affairs and no one is talking about it. 
",give_me_sugar," Our society's repressed holier-than-thou ideals are being exposed for the sham they are. This is just what happens when a sexually frustrated people's animalistic instincts rise to the surface.

At the same time, IRL, guys and girls talking can be made a huge deal. I fear for our youth can anyone tell me why the dislikes ?  Dudes, dont just downvote. Share your opinions.  Bollywood coming off age and doing what Malayalam film industry was doing 30 years ago 1. Youtube mostly works on an algorithm which shows you preferences based on location. Crime patrol is a regularly watched show. It's the specific channel's fault for providing explicit looking thumbnails for the videos. 
2. Sex always sells. Have you watched adverts on tv? Almost all of them are sexually charged. And this happens all over the world, more so in the west especially in the US. Try searching carls jr burger ads.
3. Bollywood is an industry, an entertainment industry, just like pornography. If it doesn't serve the needs of it's audience, it will fail to make money. I am not supporting the industry at any rate here. It had deplorable standards even from it's early stage with women being shown in poor light (and that's an understatement).
Suddenly asking them to change their business model is impossible, it has to be voluntary. When people stop going to shitty movies even if they are made by famous actors then they have to start adopting good scripts.
4. Private videos, nudes leaking has always been a problem in the modern world. It is not exclusive to India. That being said the responsibility rests on the youth when it comes to private affairs and a simple NO goes a long way.
And last of all sorry to say this but you seem to have a problem with everything in the country. There are somethings that are out of a single person's reach like the internet, an industry and private affairs of third parties. What it seems to me (please tell me if i made a mistake in my judgement) is you want censorship all over. And most points you mentioned here aren't even related to each other. And the title of this discussion also is irrelevant.  Youtube was a complete shit show. Its getting better though. Few days ago got a survey on offensive content on the home page, and that is when I noticed desi b grade soft porn content had reduced when the survey question popped up. There were a few ""offensive"" video and I chose the same option on YT.

YT is very lethargic to change, not at all proactive. Your headline is not appropriate to your content , say, entertainment industry is going in wrong direction",Entertainment,2016-04-12 22:05:40

Making fun of us...[](/wat) Bollywood is having it's Larry The Cable Guy moment with a string of dumb ass action/comedies because Singham/Bodyguard type of movies make money. 

Fucking Salman Khan, Ajay Devgan and Akshay Kumar. 

Then people post shit like ""it's a nice movie if you leave your brain home"". Well dogshit is a great cuisine if you leave your tastebuds home. How can someone sit through 3 hours without a brain?  Whenever I hear the words "" complete entertainer"" mentioned in relation to a film, I know that it's one to avoid WTF is this shit? :( why is this a thing? Looks like someone in the Viacom18 marketing department has discovered Reddit. Looks to me like the story is going to be based on the Telugu movie [Maryada Ramanna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryada_Ramanna). I might be wrong though. These movies of bollywood , hollywood, tollywood and kollywood  are testament to the intelligence of indians. No where in the world can people produce products of this calibre and ingenious story telling. I hate Bollywood for making fun of Punjabis and Sikhs by producing such films. I hate everyone else more for making these kind of films a hit.  Ajay Devgan's acting is lame. His emotional range is mostly that of someone who is clenching and unclenching his ass.

Irfan Khan, Manoj B, etc are the real actors in bollywood today. This is a remake of a horrid piece-of-shit movie called Maryadaramanna. I hate buses for subjecting me to that form of torture. Guys let me break it down for you,

""Movies are as good as its viewers can enjoy"".

That being said, 

1. Bodyguard was a shitty movie because Salman is too fucking bad with his voice and height.

2. Singham was awesome because of Ajay's dialogue, every time he said 'Maajhi Satak Li"", my dick went perpendicular to my testicles surface.

3. Rowdy Rathore was fucking awesome and messed my mind for weeks.

4. SRK, Salman and Aamir are lorus, can't do action scenes because of their short stature.

Classic Aamir Khan interview. Don't know if any other celebrity has this depth of knowledge and articulation. and yes the reporter is an Ass.,25,wl4b4,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/Im-concerned-about-India-not-World-Aamir-Khan/articleshow/14932755.cms,25,,Manoos," Whys is the reporter an ass?
If the reporter doesn't ask these questions, the answers showing his depth of knowledge won't come out. 
 Damn, he's seriously turned out to be a great guy for India. In comparison to any other A-level celebrity, he's always been the most outspoken about confronting issues in Indian society (through his movies and his shows), as well as starring in awesome films that reaffirm the good in Bharatis. 

*Rang De Basanti*, *Lagaan*, *Taare Zameen Par* & *3 Idiots* are some that come to mind.

But what's even better is that he actually utilizes his star power and national platform to do some thing for India. Standing up against the ""pseudo-secular"" media's inertia and self-righteous moaning, criticizing state governments for their failings on various issues, and being the FIRST person to seriously address the Caste issue in a 1 and a half hour special on national TV, is just fucking awesome.

Anyways, hope he continues to do more for India - he's already inspired a few million people through the 1st season of SMJ, to get off their collective asses and actually make an effort to help out NGOs with all the social issues he raised during the show. 

Takes real balls to do all this: serious props to the guy. We should have him on r/india to do a AMA. We can throw him some better questions and respect than the dumbass reporter. Just curious if even the printed edition of TOI regularly has such horrible punctuation/editing?

Edit: or may be this was an email interview? Aamir seems to have bad punctuation too, looking at his blog. Of course, he is an artist not a copywriter, and it is finally the reporter's job to get it right.  > Here is a person,whose name happens to be Anna Hazare,but thats not important.Whats important is what hes asking for: Can we have a strict law against corruption 

Mental Applause. **Do you genuinely believe organic farming can feed the world**

Allow me to direct your attention to the following points.

1. The premise of the article itself is hilarious nonsense, and has been [denied by the UN](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,601525,00.html) 
2. It has been lifted almost word-for-word from an article published by the Sunday Times, and reprinted by the gullible folks at ToI.
3. It has the words "" Start of sidebar. Skip to end of sidebar. End of sidebar. Return to start of sidebar."" in the middle of the article.

Thus, ToI, one of the largest English language newspapers in the world, has published utter trash on its front page.

India needs more reporters covering agricultural and labour issues. We have enough pundits vaguely talking about changes.

Zindagi is the first channel to syndicate content from countries such as Pakistan, Egypt and Turkey. Zindagi was launched with three most popular shows from across the border — Zindagi Gulzar Hai, Aunn Zara and Kaash Main Teri Beti Na Hoti. Soon the channel became popular with the Indian masses and since then they have been airing Pakistani shows and making original Indian content as well.



With a strong message from Chairman of Essel Group things will get more serious from here on. The party (MNS) has also written an open letter to Bollywood producers and production houses, asking them why they need to rope in actors from the neighbouring country when enough talent is available in India.

"Harvey Weinstein effect: Is it possible for something like this to happen in Indian Entertainment Industry, specifically Bollywood?",141,7ceeql,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7ceeql/harvey_weinstein_effect_is_it_possible_for/,97,"While im not sure about Assault and Rape, general Sexual Harassment is surely commonplace in Bollywood too. So is nobody gonna come out and speak up?

And if Anyone does, will it actually hurt Indian Superstars? Like say if a group accuses Salman of Sexual Harassment and Assault, will he be wiped off the face of the planet like Kevin Spacey?",BaidDSB," India idolizes stars and celebrities to a whole another level. Harvey Weinstein while powerful didn’t really have the fan following, say, Salman Khan has.  I doubt whistleblowers can be safe here due to movie stars having close political ties.

Harvey incident may have destroyed some careers, but here they may come after your life.  The thing that people are missing is that Harvey didn't go down because of simple allegations, Ronan Farrow did excellent work by producing tangible evidence so that the machinery was *forced* to act.

 All the rest of the allegations, against other people are because people see if even Harvey can be brought doen, then their abuser can be too. But that wouldn't have happened at all if it wasn't for Ronan reporting so effectively.  If it is just going to be allegations, then nothing would have happened, And the victims would face consequences. I think the same is going to happen to all these other cases, more than half of them are going to be thrown out or a small punishment given because of how tough it is to prove sexual misconduct . I don't think so,unless the accuser herself is a powerful celebrity.

No one is gonna pay attention to behind the screen murmurs and allegations from anonymous women. Considering what happened to Sayali Bhagat's career after she[ accused Amitabh Bachchan of groping her] ( https://www.missmalini.com/2011/10/25/sayali-bhagats-saga-of-sexual-harassment-just-got-murkier-with-the-inclusion-of-sajid-khan-arya-babbar-and-even-big-b/), I very much doubt it. Lol , Didn't you hear about the [actress abduction and molestation case that happened in the Malayalam film industry](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/malayalam-actress-abduction-dileep-pulsar-suni-nadhirshah/1/993338.html) ? 

The number 3 (in terms of popularity) actor and arguably the most influential person in Malayalam industry , dileep has his long time love affair with a co-star, ratted out to his then wife by  another actress who is a mutual friend and longtime collaborator. He practically banishes said actress from the Industry for years, blacklisting her and anyone who works with her. 

Then not satisfied, he allegedly, orders a well known goon who does protection services for actors, to kidnap said actres, film her in compromising positions and use it to blackmail her.  

 But contrary to 'expected' rape victim behaviour, the actress (who was engaged at the time) comes out in public and files a case. Now the actor and co-conspirators are under investigation. 

But even with confirmed kidnap & rape of the actress and enough evidence to make a preliminary arrest, half the people in kerala, are convinced that their beloved (peoples hero aka jana-priya-nayakan) is being just set up and the actress is faking her rape. 

Character assassinations of the actress  (who has played glamorous role in Telugu/kannada aka , malayalamspeak for whorish behavior) , have been done by elected MLAs and filmmakers aligned in the actors camp. The actor has been out on bail for barely 3 weeks, already 2-3 chief witnesses have changed other statements. 

This friends, is what happens to harvey weinsteins in India.  >Like say if a group accuses Salman of Sexual Harrasment

How dare you even name bhai in such a post? He only be accused of killing people on the foothpath and deers in the forest. Nah. We are at 70s in US time. Will happen in the  2050-60s. Didn't those Pancholi lads went about destroying some careers? 

Salman Khan-Vivek Oberoi. Although that was a different angle, but still you can see the power the bigwigs hold.  India has a celebrity problem. Bhai fans took to streets to protest his conviction. The offense was murder there. Do you think people will abandon their male heroes just because some women makes rape allegations against them. They would call the women whores and stuff. whats more powerful than money? Salman molested Aish that is a well-known fact.  Of course it happens, it happens to entertainment industry world wide.

So long as male producers/directors etc have power over actresses careers, this will happen. America despite its sexual controversy actually respects women, there is a culture for women to live and work independently. People generally don't see them as meat. Misogyny is low in reality. In India, none of that exists outside a few urban enclaves. If they can get away with murder and tax fraud, then they may get away with this too. 

Also, some producers are really well connected with the underworld. 

But remember what happened to Sanjay Dutt. He had to serve time for illegal possession of arms. So there may be hope for justice. [deleted] If there's proof, for sure they'll go down. Even Shakti Kapoor was shunned for a while after his scandal broke out. If something like ramming over people and killing people doesn't do much to dent a famous celebrity's reputation, then I REALLY doubt cases of sexual harassment/assault would do much. yes it happened with TVF arnab kumar. although that was not proper bollywood. Too much social stigma in our country. Victims will be victims again. No point in speaking up in such an atmosphere. I hope this changes. We need voices.  Not just possible, I am sure it's happening. No all actors are relatives of producers. Saw someone in the South Industry do it taking about the ""Why this Kolavarri Di"" guy drugging her. And then she leaked everyones nudes. It's on a nsfw sub. In the Indian Entertainment Industry Sana Khan sexually harasses you.


In other news [upvote this to the top for lulz](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiancelebs/comments/7cfsxc/ranveer_singh/) Nope!! To begin you can only accuse someone of doing it . With crazy fans here the accusations will most likely be termed or written off as fake or attention whoring , and since Bollywood is a tight knit society you'll never work again. Also most top of the food chain guys have extensive connections with politicians , money launderers and the underworld. So even after coming out you'll be unsafe. never. no one believes the victims.  look at tarun tejpal and how many influential people came to his defense. In Hollywood, anyone making allegation becomes a ""heroine"", a ""feminist icon"", a ""strong person"", a ""poor victim"" etc etc.

In Bollywood, the people who would make an allegation will be treated with ridicule & sneered at. A change is gonna come...oh yes it will...it's been a looong time coming.... kangana already did it, bhedu 😎",Entertainment,2017-11-12 16:47:02

In India, send them to cricket if you cannot give them bread. Many channels, day and night, are showing cricket as if that is the problem of the country.

Sure, as a Supreme Court judge, speeches from the bench were an admirable means of articulating his viewpoint. But already, [in his first speech to the PCI](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2526523.ece), he has managed to irritate several people with his *tone*.

>* Covered in tricolor balloons and marigold, India's fastest train ""Gatimaan Express"" today made its debut run from Delhi to the Taj Mahal city of Agra in 100 minutes.While it did score a record, the train was just seven minutes faster than the Shatabdi Express, on the same route.Its top speed of 160 km an hour is half that of trains in China, Japan, France and other countries.Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said the Gatimaan Express with ""train-hostesses"" and an entertainment system brings in ""a new era of high-speed rail travel"".Described by the government as India's first ""semi high-speed train"", Gatimaan is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to overhaul one of the world's oldest rail networks over five years.Passengers were this morning welcomed with roses by the hostesses as they boarded the gleaming royal blue-and-grey train at the Nizamuddin Railway station in south Delhi.The Gatimaan includes bio-toilets, a GPS-passenger information service, automatic sliding doors in coaches, free WiFi and an entertainment system.The menu is an eclectic mix - Spanish omelet, date walnut cake, wheat upma, Kanjeevaram idli, aloo kulcha, mini dosa, chicken rolls and Swiss rolls, served on chinaware.A train ride costs Rs 750 or 1,500 depending on whether one is traveling in the two ""executive class"" coaches or in the AC chair car coaches.The Gatimaan will run six days a week, except on Fridays when the Taj Mahal is shut.The government's promise of a great ride was tested today when passengers like Ravi complained that the plug points weren't working and there was no Wifi.But still others had good feedback.

>* ""Reaching 160 km is a great achievement for Indian railways.

>* Hope they can keep up with it,"" says Ashwin, a law student who took the day off to try the executive coach experience.Most trains in India average speeds of around 110 km an hour.

Theatres with facilities for people with disabilities? [NP],7,2h0goy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2h0goy/theatres_with_facilities_for_people_with/,4,"Hello!

Are there any theatres in India which provide facilities for people with disabilities? I had asked one of the blogs on tumblr if they go to the theatres on the wheelchair, and she's from different country. Turns out they have really awesome facilities, and it didnt seem to be a problem. Haven't really seen that in india, but I live in a small so I might not be that informed. So are there?

And there probably should be more of these, why are pwds considered anti-social, anti-sexual, more like anti-human in India? Okay maybe I'm going somewhere else with this, but it would be nice to discuss this with people.",blasphemasphus," We have a huge population and hence we don't invest in things with low returns. Sad but true. You're talking about accessible theaters when PWDs in India don't even get basic amenities to live their daily lives, provided they somehow decide to come out of their homes, against all odds and social stigma. 

I'm talking just about metro cities. Broken footpaths (if any), no ramps to climb the footpath, inaccessible buildings, markets, huge ass spead-breakers on roads, no designated handicapped parking even in private office complexes, and not even worth talking about government offices.

Yes, India is improving, slowly and painfully yet I'm sure we'll get there someday, but sadly enough it probably wont happen in my life time. I see videos of PWDs in US/UK and other well off nations, hear stories from folks overseas: right from the apartments to metro, to local mart, to college, to gym, everything is accessible and a person on wheelchair can easily carry on with their lives,  like any other able bodied person. It's heart wrenching that here, we can't. You have to be dependent on someone to help you cross that ugly pothole or climb the 12inch high footpath with no ramp, because if you don't, one of the buses will mow you down. You can't just go to any school/college because more than half the classes are not on ground floor (oh what's an elevator?).

When you give up on so many of your dreams because it's just not feasible, movies, theaters, restaurants, entertainment become the last thing on your mind. This is why you don't see so many people on wheelchair out on the streets, this why they stay inside, because outside is too difficult to even reach, let alone survive.

Inside the Dating Life of a Mediocre/Average Looking Guys,347,bz8uvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bz8uvn/inside_the_dating_life_of_a_mediocreaverage/,372,"##No Long Posts From Now On

##Thanks for the Platinum Reddit stranger

**Intro** - *Please read the edits too.*

**Prologue** - *The following post is written in no way to justify the actions of crass men who exist in our society and unfortunately it's quite shameful for even us that such men exist who harrass women and make their lives hell. Even I am not perfect and have my own flaws. I have written it at start and not at the end edit part so that people atleast read this and not call me misogynist, sexist pig who has written this for petty karma or gilding without reading. Or even call me someone who would brag about his masculinity and inflated ego.*

Now coming to the main part as to how-if not most-many women treat mediocre/average guys when they approach the ladies after practising what to say and shitting their pants. This hit me yesterday when someone said why are you taking it personally, well if someone tells their side of the story maybe it's time for me to also tell the least discussed opposite side of the coin.

Before I start let me tell you a small life story of my first proposal that till today taught me a lot. A month or two before exams a few of neighborhood friends and me decided to take private group tuitions. This is where I met my crush. So after boards, JEE mains and advanced and BITSAT all had ended we used to hang out a bit often. One day while we came back from lunch because her birthday's party was due, I told her that I had developed something for her that I couldn't explain. She said she got to know by my actions and a very caring attitude and treatment. So I still remember we were D block parking, CP where she told me these lines that I try to quote nearly what I remember. ""I have no feelings for you and I have to say NO to you. It might hurt you today but you'll remember me for good."" 
That moment was the most heartbreaking moment for me, I won't lie I didn't say a word, left her alone there, took a metro and came back home. On the way back I deleted her number, deleted the message chat on my Nokia. I accepted her decision, though I cried but did accept. After about 10-12 days we meet, I have no feelings for her anymore like 85% were dead, 15% remained because she was my crush. She hugged me and said sorry for she was rude(which she wasn't) and I too said sorry for leaving her alone and coming back home and deleting her number and everything immature I did. 

So to this day we are great friends and she has been an amazing advisor to me. How did that happen? It's because she didn't keep me on strings and told me one word i.e. **NO**. She didn't make pathetic excuses, kept me on hold or played with my emotions. What if she had played with me? I couldn't answer that but eventually found out as I grew up.

Jumping back to the present stage. A few weeks backs I announced at the LNRDT that I am going on my first date after a long time. I was really excited. I trimmed my hair, shaved my beard, chose perfect shirt and jeans and took out my new sneakers. Told mom I was going on my X friend's birthday in a cafe in CP. Though she might have guessed it's entirely a different story. I get a WhatsApp maybe hour or so before leaving that due to hot weather she can't make it as her parents aren't allowing. I thought it might be genuine concern and then said let's catch-up someday evening. I was pretty much sad but somehow consoled myself that it's just being shifted and not being cancelled. That's when things started to get shady. She gradually stopped reply to my texts and when I finally asked her about 10 days later why is she playing with me and ghosting me she told me ""She was sorry to play around me, but she had found someone else who was more compatible and *taller* than me."" I said ok bye. I hung up, deleted her chats and number and remembered the my first rejection.

Here comes the main part how we (addressing mediocre and average looking men) are treated by women who are significantly out of our aukat. 

* When you try to hit on them or even ask them out instead of telling **NO** they play along. They emotionally drain us and make us feel that even though we are shit as compared to them, still if we improve ourselves we can become capable of dating them. In the meanwhile they use our goodness and services and we act as their butlers, keeping track of their lives, sharing their happiness and being with them in their times of hardship. 
* Then when they feel we have improved ourselves and get ready to propose again with much confidence and improvements, they drop the emotional blackmail bomb. They simply address it by saying that ""What if we break up, what if we aren't compatible, what if we fight"", and so many guilt trip giving queries. Then drops the nuclear missile, ""See I don't want to lose a caring human being like you, in these few days we have become more like best friends but not a couple.""
* The guys pretty much get into the guilty feeling of losing such an amazing human being in life and settle for sticking around as a friend killing all the feelings after being put on strings and never told a straight forward NO.
* Poor guys like us don't even get a clue that it was never going to happen. It was just a way of slowly controlling us like a puppet to have their way.
* Even if the above scenario doesn't take place, it's alternative takes place. Where comes in the close friends WhatsApp groups that has screenshots of the guys pictures, all chats and girls mocking how that guy doesn't her standards and too average to be presentable. Instead of again telling a **NO** game is played, excuses are built up and a whole circle of the same activity takes place, where eventually the guy suffers as he is emotionally drained, stuck in between like a dhobi ka kutta (washerman's dog). Can't even get away from her because friendship and can't even come closer because standards don't match and he is kept for entertainment purposes.
* Or if you are a bit above average like my friend and you get a proposal and you turn it down straightway saying you aren't interested, the girl says she is going to take her life and then your life again gets in hell. Or you fall into the trap of dating someone who just broke up and dates you to be her emotional punching bag.

What's one thing common here? Selective biasness or as someone pointed out the Halo Effect. 

> The halo effect is a cognitive bias that causes one trait (e.g., beauty) to drastically color your perception of all other traits. If you think someone is beautiful, you are also likely to assume they’re smart, ambitious, interesting, etc.

Simply saying it means that if a guy is good looking he is smart, trustworthy and compatible. But if a guy is average/mediocre he doesn't match your standards, would turn out to be creepy and even clingy.

That's why ladies readily accept a good looking guy, but keeps the average looking guy on hold/strings. Where she is the captain of his emotions. She will decide whether his feelings should stay or get killed. She won't ever say straightway **NO** but play and give excuses, stall, keep the person on strings. Till he is emotionally drained, mentally exhausted and aggression grips him. 

But see our plight you know, even though both good looking and mediocre looking people belong to the gender shared by rapists, harrassers, assaulter etc, who gets instantly blacklisted quite a few times? The mediocre looking guy and good looking guy gets a free pass . And it's not just my story, it the story of countless people who are termed as lifeless virgins nowadays. 

I know women go through the major hardships but when they are asked why didn't they say **NO**, they say because they don't want to be at the receiving end of the outcome. Well no denying they have to deal with psychos, but also they get out of that situation easily by always making the same excuse. For that no one would blame them thanks to such crass people who share the same gender with us. Who ends up at the real receiving end? Ofcourse the average looking guys. Because we don't have anything of our own after we propose or luckily get into a relationship with a woman up a higher notch. She is the holder of our emotions, she can blackmail us easily because we aren't her level and she has done a massive favour for us. She controls us emotionally and mentally. And in that process we get torn into bits and pieces. **The excuses and keeping us on strings where straightway a harsh and hurting truth in form of NO, could have been told, we get more agressive and much more fanatic. Getting in a relationship becomes an obsession because we are drained of emotions and love and affection is all we need.**

Thinking of all my dates and talking to my friends yesterday one things is clear, how to get a bit of love and affection, we give up a huge part of our emotional self. Where instead of giving ourselves and our families and friends importance we get trapped and give someone the importance and limelight who is just there to play around and fiddle with us. For women they can easily say they don't trust men but what can we say? Nothing? We are just played along the way and blamed eventually for all things that we do and even might not have done ever.

**And weird part is nearly everyone I talked to from a few friends to Reddit strangers** have gone through same shit, but it never comes to light because we are the tough gender. Handling rejections shouldn't be a huge task for us. How to tell handling rejections would have been easier if it was a simple NO and not a game of snakes and ladders. It's somewhere our fault too that we fail to take note of all that glitters is not gold kind of situation. That we fail to move on rather than going down the spiral. Is a straight NO too much to ask for? Are we such low class begins that telling us **NO** on face has such negative impact?

I don't know how people will respond to me, maybe I get downvoted, maybe I get abused, maybe I get called out for shifting the blame or anything. But one thing for sure is I feel somewhat sad and happy at the same time while writing this down. Sad because I couldn't take control of the situations even though my intuition said so and happy because I could tell the least discussed side of my lives.

**What's the way out? Simple, rather than being someone's dog on leash, live your life alone with friends and family and do arranged marriage at the end. Because you don't have those attractive genes and inner beauty matters shit when you only seen to be a friendship material.**

PS - While saving this it made me realise how quite a lot of us get ill treated and never have the courage to speak out but at the same time I realised, **HOW WE ILL TREAT WOMEN AT TIMES TOO IN THE NAME OF FORCED LOVE AND AFFECTION. AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE IF I HAVE EVEN FOR A MOMENT ILL TREATED SOMEONE.**

##Thanks to my crush for making me stronger and more emotionally sound as a human being to handle rejections better and part ways with someone who isn't available to share her feelings

Edit 1: Don't abuse anyone, I have written this post from all your experiences, so be a bit more sensible and even if girls comment something let them comment and read their views as well. We have to be a bit courteous fellas.

**Edit 2: People saying you get played because of kindness and all. I have seen enough shit so I don't fall for it now because of my experience and people around me who advice me. But for people who are alone and no one to guide/advice them are blinded by emotions and you can't blame them at all. They aren't experienced much and this post might give them a harsh reality that they still might not accept.**

Edit 3: Please stop DMing me that everything will be alright. I am fine c'mon. I read between the lines now since my last date, so don't fall for that trap anymore probably. Help the helpless ones in comments. They need some guidance.

Edit 4: Thanks for that Silver ❤️

**Edit 5: This post is to tell you to move on. That if you feel stuck, time to get off and life your life with dedication towards yourself. IT'S AN EYE OPENER FOR YOU ALL. It's not at all about I am a nice guy, I should get women like fuckboys and handsome guys do. It's about learning about your flaws as well.**

Edit 6: Thanks for the Gold ❤️

Edit 7: I won't keep replying I am tired and have to do work as well. Atleast read the edits before you raise the same point.

**Edit 8: For women my message is simple, I know boys are shit and you don't always need to give them a NO because of your safety but atleast have enough courtesy to not play with their emotions. Don't keep him as a friend if you know he still has feelings for you and can rebound back. Let him go, don't make him feel guilty about himself. BOYS DO SUFFER EMOTIONALLY.**",ssj_cule," I see all these beta losers telling their crushes that they like them and then getting rejected.

An alpha chad like me just bottles these feelings inside, checks their crushes' Instagram every night before sleeping, and just stares at their crushes from a distance (stealthily). This was an interesting read. Must have taken you a long time to type it out. Your first crush seems like a pretty cool person. Mujhe teri pappi leni hai Man I allot more time to read Reddit posts than I can possibly allot for a date. Maybe it's because I just don't give a damn about girls now, all those teenage years trying to get a gf or just a date is so behind me. India usually has a demand and supply issue. Lots and lots of guys are there for almost every girl even if she is very average. Even from the doodhwala, to auto wala, to neighbor wala, to classmates, to colleagues, to general stalkers try to hit on her or propose her for dating. They have a lot to chose from and are brought up thinking they are the centre of attraction. This somehow gets them high.

Also to blame are the shitty cheesy movies and music videos where the girl plays hard to get.

This is just my observation of my friends love life. I'm glad I didn't have to go through a lot, at least whenever I initiated a relationship. Though things get fucked up later, but that is purely about mine or my partners fault. Reading this made me feel pretty good about my life right now. [deleted] Out of our Aukaat 😂 . Nice write up man ✌️ Never fall for ""It is just your personality bro, you should go out and talk to girls"" meme. Do not go to date in this country if you are ugly and poor. It is not worth the risk and emotional suffering. The first girl that rejected you is 0.0001% of population, you were lucky you were subjected to that kind of rejection at your first time that taught you what to to expect and handle things maturely. Arey bhai bhai bhai...

Hope it gets better for you! Imo the reason such girls play us like a fiddle, is that they are unsure of that other ""better"" guy. If it eventually works with him, they'll either say so to us, or slowly ghost away. If it doesn't work out with him, well, we are the second option. Sucks to be an average guy. :( Not to be crude, but what's your height that she had to give that messed up reason to ditch you? I too am short, that's my insecurity asking this question. This might be a very presumptuous comment but I'm kind of getting a vibe from this that you're probably someone who's like in 1st or 2nd year of college at the most. I'm not trying to pull the age card on you but there's a decent chance here that you're just not friends with or know a lot of girls. 

If you're interested in a bit of a social experiment, try being friends with a really good looking guy (especially if you're in college). The more fuckboi type the better, it'll show you the flip side from the girls' POV. Right now you seem to be having the feeling that girls have it perfect in the dating game but that's actually not true, they have similar issues and if you can see how badly they're affected by rejection or how much they pursue the people they like then you'll be a lot more empathetic and take the whole dating scenario less to heart. 

I have a friend who's so good looking that when we were in second year of college, the graduating batch of that year (4th year) used to lust after him. This is pretty uncommon cause almost no college relationship used to be between a senior girl and a junior boy. His life stories, the FB messages he received, the constant attention he got from random girls in events like fests was actually very instructive to me. It helped humanizing girls for me, like I could see that they're as desperate and stupid in the dating scenario as guys are and that really helped me in realising that it's not as if wo rajah hai aur hum kangal. Everyone's in the same boat.

If you have any female friend just ask them about what kind of stupid shit they've done in the name of love and I'll guarantee you that it would at least equal if not surpass the most stupid shit you might have done. 

PS The Halo Theory absolutely works, it's the biggest cheat code in life after being born to wealth. Quora is leaking again Desire is the root cause of sorrow, said Buddha. Karm kar fal ki ichcha mat kar, said Krishna.

Solution is simple, but difficult to comprehend when you're being governed by your emotions. Average looking is hardly any obstacle in long game. I wish I could've explained it to you in person.

Best of luck, stay cool :) Right in the feels. Don't stress too much. If you can score dates great, if not move on with your life. Assume everyone's scum until they prove otherwise - both men and women - and you'll be less shocked in life. (That doesn't mean there is nothing to learn from rejections - if your body is that of a chicken, or you don't bathe, or dress well, or have no interests or personality - those are definitely things you can work on).

Focus on building credentials and a career. There's a reason Urvashi Rautela puts up with Boney Kapoor. > Here comes the main part how we (addressing mediocre and average looking men) are treated by women who are significantly out of our aukat.

  
Why do you care how others treat you? Or that you're entitled to be treated in a good way? 
  
  
The best way you can treat someone is by giving them your time and attention.  
  
If a girl doesn't give you an immediate response, or says that she'll think about it and will reply within a specified time, it's safe to assume it is a no. Doesn't matter how pretty the girl is, or how well you get along together or how great a time you have, how many dreams you have had about/with her, it is a no. Stop giving your time and attention to her. [deleted] Everything about this post is so right. 
When the right person comes you don't to change anything about yourself they'll accept you for who you are. For them you'll be a good looking guy even if you're average. As beauty lies in the eyes of beholder. We don't even need to hear your reasons for **No**. It keeps it to yourself. But if someone is being silent. It does not really mean anything and really sucks. So don't be silent. A small **No** helps a lot.

don't mislead us for no reasons. It's very difficult to get over it. When you are being silent. We are trying to figure out a reason for you being silent/start to question ourselves (maybe something is wrong with us. Insecurities/self-worth). Even though we know deep down it was a rejection. A **No** helps a lot in moving on. 

I was strung for quite some time late last year. Mislead till she found someone. And it was like a gravitational pull how much I tried to get out of it.  It pulled me more in. And I knew exactly what's happening. If someone has feelings for you give them some time to move on. Being friends does not work When one side has feelings. It hurts. And makes it more difficult to move on from you. 

Also, it saves us from wasting our time. A simple **No** helps a lot in moving on faster. We need a Inside the Dating Life of Average Looking Girl as well. Assume its a No unless you get a solid Yes. Is that so difficult?

It may seem difficult, but given the unequal power equations in Indian society, that is the only way to resolve this for now. Assume a No.

I am saying this from experience as an unkil. Worked for me. I was obsessed with some girl or the other since LKG. But I also had a massive ego (different from self confidence, which I did not have much of). But I was absolutely clear that I will not make a fool of myself by chasing someone who does not truly care. Worked all my life. Not just in love, but in every personal relationship. 

Why is it so difficult? 

I can understand why. A NO means that you do not match up to the requirements of the girl. That is REALITY. Accept that you will not match up to the wishes of a vast majority of people - forget girls - ALL YOUR LIFE. Cut your losses and move on. Do no spend time dreaming. There is always someone on your wavelength around.

What if that someone is not visible anywhere? Two things.

1. You are in the wrong environment. Run. If you are in the wrong place, you are probably not going to find someone who likes you.

2. Learn to build your personality and advertise it. Sell it. Evaluate yourself using the harshest possible standards you can find, find your biggest flaws, and work on them. Find your biggest strengths, and make sure that those strengths - whether it be focus, professionalism, caring, affection - are visible to all potential candidates. Visible, but not in their faces. And not by going and telling them about it. When you do this, the right kind of people WILL COME TO YOU. This works for both men and women, in my experience.

What about the occasional confused ones, and the liars and cheaters?

They do exist. They are products of their family, environment. When you get a hint that someone is like that, again, resort to a highly critical evaluation of that person. If they fail, run. There is no need, there is always someone who fits better.

Do not oversell yourself. Your overselling is obvious, in most cases. People can see through your disguises, especially when you are young and faking it. Even if you manage to fool yourself, people can see through you somewhat. Be honest to yourself and the rest of the world (to the extent that its safe to). It will give you solid skills in understanding who is honest to you, and dishonest or self deceiving with you.

Back to my first point. Assume a NO. You don't want to, I know. But the answer is NO in most cases. Live with it. Evolution decided that for you. Ever wondered what the dating life of mediocre or average looking girls is, or do you only run after the good looking ones? Only one thing I am going to say. Men are expendable, their feelings are expendable, their desires are expendable. There is reason arrange marriage exists in India, which is because the dating culture is shite. You need to understand this is a world of give and take. If don't have anything meaningful to offer, you have zero worth. And I am not talking about personality. That comes last. They look for things like can you provide for them? Can you give them a social status? Does their social status improve upon dating/marrying you? There is nothing wrong with this. This how humans have been surviving through all these years. Not because of ""love"". But because of greed. Greed have something better in life. Greed to have something better for your offsprings. It's our most basic survival emotion. Check out this standup on [being dark and getting married.](https://youtu.be/aTUiGWJinX0)

But what do I know? Neither I am from IIT or IIM? Just normal guy trying to bring balance to this universe. Lol, this feels kinda weird reading this post and all the other relationship stuff here, when you can't even imagine yourself being in a relationship. too distant, its almost unreal. I want to make a separate post [told it here before many times] about how my so called ex gf ruined 3 whole years of my life and i didnt even know why until the end of the said 3 years. 

If anyone wants to hear it, i will gladly show to the pseudo feminists why women arent so pure as they think they are.

EDIT: Posted Call me a whiteknight or a pseudo feminist or whatever you want. But if your post is in a way a disagreement of the previous post then it's probably an overreaction. 

That post was about girls not saying No because of personal safety and there were multiple stories to back it up. Now you say a girl should say NO specifically because you  and some men feel like you got friendzoned or strung along and played with your emotions. 

Whether you are a creep or not doesn't come printed on your forehead. And if it could then those creeps would have done it too. Getting played along or friendzoned or emotionally hurt is a choice,you can opt out of it with a little introspection, however difficult it might be 

That was the entire point of the previous post,if it's not an enthusiastic yes,it's a no. Follow it to the T and you won't get played or hurt. 

Regarding your personal accounts,I agree somewhat because I am also an average looking guy. But I'm not gonna obsess over getting a girl that is a notch higher than me. If you are stuck in the same primitive vanity fest mindsets of judging your self-worth with the conventional attractiveness of your partner then you don't get the right to complain when they themselves turn out to be vanity fests and judge people based on things like height. Fuck(forget) that tinder girl and hope you'll find someone better,even if she's not as pretty or whatever.

I also want to say I wish men's issues were discussed more but this is not a ""vs"",in this case that post was easily the more correct one. From my experience too my cousin was stalked,and a friend of mine asked someone out and she didn't seem enthusiastic about it so my friend took it well and cancelled their date and they never talked again and he moved on pretty well. None of that played along or friendzoned drama. > The halo effect is a cognitive bias that causes one trait (e.g., beauty) to drastically color your perception of all other traits. If you think someone is beautiful, you are also likely to assume they’re smart, ambitious, interesting, etc.

> Simply saying it means that if a guy is good looking he is smart, trustworthy and compatible. But if a guy is average/mediocre he doesn't match your standards, would turn out to be creepy and even clingy.

[Hahaha. I got reminded of this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9MBUcCixvY)

But I think partly the mistake is also on you guys who allow girls to treat you like that. First of all you have to understand that you don't have to be ""nice"". Just be kind. If you understand this difference, you can just move on and do better things with your life. Bro, before I break it to you, let me tell you that I have a non-existent dating life and it's not survivorship bias talking here. 

So the thing is that we humans which includes women as well, are animals in our nature and have the same basic instincts. Just like a female animal in the wild will choose the best and fittest mate, similarly a human female will always be inclined to choose the best of the lot available to her, and by best I mean best in what matters to her. 

I don't think that absolutely any woman in this world owes anything to us, or that we deserve anything (""we"" includes every man, handsome or not). She is a human, so are we, she can choose to spend her time with whoever she wants and so can we.  

The point that they go for looks and not for ""inner beauty"" is moot. Let her go for looks if she wants to, and thinking that you have a lot of ""inner beauty"" and the handsome guy doesn't is stupid until you are sure beyond any doubt. 

And about keeping us on strings, now is the time to learn to be assertive and start thinking with your head rather than your dick. You get treated the way you allow yourself to be treated. OP, you say you are an average or below average guy. And you say you are going through shit or getting treated like one when trying to get into a relationship. Now without much information I can only assume here but how many of these women that you proposed or shared your feelings for were below average or mediocre women? It was a good read. Thanks for sharing! Stay strong brother..
Edit: thanks for the silver kind stranger Saving for later. It is a long ass post Mate you own a restaurant in Mumbai right, I have seen it over Swiggy  with the restaurant named as and I quote ,"" Delhi se hu BC"". Reading this makes me happy I was shorter than average and spent my days off college in playing half life and other sports, watching all sorts of cartoons.
Married now , with a good wife 5h since post was up, I see.

*time to sort by controversial and get my tub of popcorn* bc, you need to have just two things, just two fucking things, self-respect and a passion in life. Kya dating relationship k peeche bhag re ho. This is a gold mine. I always wanted to know the demographic of r/india and this really opens my eyes. I'm tagging. Can anyone tell me how do we tag our non responding tinder matches here? Did you try Axe deo? I respect your feelings and thoughts. That being said, I would suggest you to introspect a little. Why cant guys consider someone in or below their league? Most of the times, Girls from those leagues do give bhaav but we treat them the same way girls out of our leagues do! Beauty bias is Natural and okay to have. 

I have seen girls getting beaten by her parents for receiving a proposal SMS. So, life is harder for girls. Some of them can't risk being upfront about their rejection, for the fear of guys turning psychopath. Having said that, the chicks who exploit their majnus by hanging them around to pay their bills are grade A Bitches. You should be glad yours didn't turn out like that. 

And it's okay to get rejected. Cheers. Naya lagta hai! The problem is you can't control how others behave. So saying ""girls should give a direct no"" makes no sense, as girls will act in their own interest, not in yours. The way to deal with this is just to raise your own standards. If a girl is non-committal, just take it as a no and move on. Anything other than accepting a date, is a no. Don't let girls string you along. Don't become so emotionally attached before they even commit. Keep your standards high and when you do date someone, it will be legit. 

PS Hope your rant made you feel better, but let go and move on. Life goes on, it isn't as bad as you think. Even ""average"" guys find love easily enough. Thanks for sharing this. I think most of us here can relate to this I really like this post!

So you said that

> That's why ladies readily accept a good looking guy, but keeps the average looking guy on hold/strings

Wasnt the point of yesterday's thread that women were too scared to outright reject guys because they were worried about how he would retaliate (something that you acknowledged too)? Isn't that different from stringing someone along? No one's denying that there are some shit people who play with others' emotions on purpose and take advantage of that other person's feeling for them, which is what happened to you.

> Are we such low class begins that telling us NO on face has such negative impact?

Not lower class, they think of us as potentially dangerous beings (which is unfair but you can see why they think so)

>  For women they can easily say they don't trust men but what can we say? Nothing? We are just played along the way and blamed eventually for all things that we do and even might not have done ever.

They play you along not because they don't trust you but because they want to take advantage of your emotions. The ones who actually don't trust you wouldn't take efforts to be around you. lol wtf? how old are you? no offense but you sound immature af. if a woman wants to date you, she will make it abundantly clear. why would you waste your time with someone who doesn't want to date you and 'hover' around them? yes women are afraid of saying no but for them to get harassed by guys is a very common occurrence. it's not a one off thing. so if they are not being direct about saying no, you should learn to read between the lines. be straightforward with them. if a woman doesn't seem to be enthusiastic and isn't reciprocating about being with you, chin the fuck up and stop hovering around them dude. 

i hate saying this but this is some top tier r/niceguys shit dude. a woman's friendship is not some consolation trophy.

>Even if the above scenario doesn't take place, it's alternative takes place. Where comes in the close friends WhatsApp groups that has screenshots of the guys pictures

not saying this doesn't take place because it definitely does. but why the fuck would you want to hang around these women? let me take a wild guess, it's because they are sexually attractive. seriously grow up dude and stop wasting your life over people who don't value you. It hit hard, man.

Thanks for sharing and letting me know I'm not alone. Thanks for writing this up. Felt so relatable. Hindustan mein jab tak saneema hai, log saala chutiya bante rahenge. Basically, don't be a female version of a fuckboi. Damn. This write-up has a ton of good points man but there's one thing I don't fully agree on with you. Just because we're average looking guys doesn't mean we're lower than them. That's just toxic mentality man, to yourself. First you gotta love yourself , try for whoever you want but love yourself first and place yourself first (this is much harder to do than it seems, I speak from experience). There's no one above your league, if you put yourself first you can see when you're turning into a lap dog for her and you can snap out of it and tell objectively whether she's actually worth it.
I know that bullshit feeling you get where you bias yourself because of your feelings and how you put them at a higher value than yourself but that is the problem in this whole situation.

I think putting yourself comes from understanding that we don't NEED a relationship to be happy and that our friends and whatever we have makes us who we are and makes happy not some ideal future we expect out of a relationship. > In the meanwhile they use our goodness and services and we act as their butlers, keeping track of their lives, sharing their happiness and being with them in their times of hardship.

[Kandhaa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq5EJunkz_k), bhai kandha. Bc thanks for the post. Going through the same thing. Gaand maraye ab woh. This was an interesting read, but there is another side to this story. 
I am not pointing towards you or anyone in specific but at times us guys just don't get the meaning of no and think of it as a rain check on proposal, or maybe worse no is not even an option.

My point is, world is filled with all kinds of people. Some will love you unconditionally and some will try to break you just for their thrill, what matters is how confident are you with yourself and how much faith you have on your actions and also how well you learn from your mistakes.

In my experience, keeping your intentions clear from the begining is the best course of action. Don't keep beating around the bush in the hope that someday that person will miraculously get to know about your feelings, even if they do they won't act on it because you were too afraid to present them confidently and properly. For cases where you did everything right and still the outcome was not what you expected, don't bend according to their needs, just back off, remember what you were there for. 
Also, don't intermix relations. This is especially true for the one's who try finding romantic partners in their friends. It's a very rare occurence and it can never be made to happen. If it is gonna happen, eventually it will otherwise it's a big No No. 

Be confident, have faith in yourself, good things will happen to you in life. It's not only looks that gives you girls,  I have average/ugly looking face. I'm tall and have good physique, I eat healthy and exercise regularly. Take good care of what I have. Most importantly I have great interpersonal communication skills and good behaviour. And good behaviour is not reserved only for girls it's for everyone, my friends, parents, siblings. I had an awesome relationship with a girl in college which didn't end up in a marriage because of social differences and right now I'm again in a sweet relationship with a beautiful girl which is going good.

What works for me is conversation skills, being confident, honesty and being able to walk away when not getting responses. Don't take rejections personally and be someone who is fun to be with. Why would a girl want to be with a bitter, sad and needy man? Be honest about your intentions from the beginning. And be firm about it without being rude/bitter. ( Like you are awesome girl and I like being with you but not just as a friend) Learn when to say no don't be pleaser. Don't do big favours or spent too much if you are not comfortable and looking for a return immediately. Having money helps but don't  try to be a sugar daddy if you want a sweet and intimate relationship.

Live your life and follow your goals. If someone doesn't like you it's completely ok because there are people that you also don't like , When you can like everyone, then you can expect the same... Just try another girl and stay happy. [removed] Hilake Soja Yes man. Your post hits home too hard.

TLDR : An average looking short guy rants about hypocrisy of women.

Firstly, the saying No part, the girls of this country are either too scared (rightly so) or they just give chances to douchebags who can't take no for an answer.

Secondly, the looks part. Oh, lord, don't get me started. There's a myth that if you are good guy girls will like you, looks don't matter at all. But man, the reality is completely opposite. You can be dipshit who treats weaker guys as shit and still  have girls around you. Seen it school, college and workplace. Can't be coincidence, right?

Moreover, I am a short guy, about 5'4 and boyish face but yeah I like to believe I'm a good guy. Not a part of nice guys but a guy with interests and hobbies. 

I have never in my life, have got a girl to even consider me something other than a ""friend"". Once I asked one of my friend, that if she thinks something more can happen between us, just asked her, hypothetical if there's anything possible; not even a second later, bam! Comes her answer : No, but if you were a bit taller, it would have. Now I had no intentions to date her, I was just asking. But this answer of hers was so shallow, it made me think of her hypocrisy.

And she says looks don't matter, have a good nature etc and all that bullshit. But at the first instance what matters to her is height. Wow.

I have asked this as scenario to various girls as an experiment in my school & college years, average looking and beautiful girls too, they all had more or less the same answers. ""You're a good guy, but I prefer someone taller."" When there own height is 5 something. 

I mean what the hell.

As much sympathize with their everyday struggles and condition in our country, but for this point, I would say screw women for being hypocritical pricks. Lekin phir recharge kaun karayega, ghoomne kaun le jayega. Pseudo bodygaurd jaise kaun saath rehega. Dusre proposers ke liye fake boyfriend kaun banega. there is always this one guy who is led on to believe he is in the game. But saale ko just chutiya banaya jaa raha hai. Well, well, well. The threads today and yesterday are infinitely better than the usual threads.Except for the ""Playdate for my puppy"" thread.That one is the best.

&#x200B;

But seriously these threads put across a point from view from both perspectives.Women should be comfortable saying No and men shouldnt take it as a personal rejection or demand answers when they are given a No If a woman tells you that she sees you only as a friend and nothing more, she is not 'friendzoning' you or stringing you along. She is saying that she doesn't want to get romantically involved with you. 

If you do not want to be friends with this person (who you found interesting enough to ask out), just get out of her life. Do not stay in it like her 'personal butler' hoping she'll change her mind. She told you her answer. It cannot be any more clear.

If you stay in her life as a friend hoping to be 'more', whose fault is that? They played us like a damn fiddle! Bro, i second this.... 
Went exactly like the second situation. She kept me like a butler by keeping me on strings for near to 2 years and at last she just found a guy out of nowhere and just told me tht u are a bestie for life.

Fuck bitches like this. I was heartbroken and depressed for nearly 3 months. I don't care what anyone says. But being emotionally played sucks ass. 

I hope no one goes through what we mediocre guys go through. And lets pray we find a solution. Damn, that's a long one. But have you ever considered getting out of the situation on your own? Take it with a pinch of salt, but I think you need to love yourself more. If you feel that someone is not treating you how you want to be treated, just take your dignity and leave. 

You're wrong if you think that girls don't like good guys but talking to someone everyday, keep track of their lives doesn't constitute some debt that can only be paid with sex/relationship. Being nice is being genuine without expectation of a reward. Being genuine is doing kind things, going out of your way to be kind or nice, without expecting something in return other than the gratitude of just making a difference.

Every time a dude complains and says he can't get girls because he is a nice guy, I have to remind him that ""nice"" is such a base level quality in a person, and in no way equates to sexual attraction. My grandma is nice. That doesn't mean I want to fuck her.

Also, sometimes no response from someone is also a response.

Edit: Lol, I am getting downvoted like crazy! Incel manifesto right here. Not surprised to see the comments full of others backing you on Reddit. Glad you made this post. I was honestly taken aback by the mass support for leaving people in yes/no limbo. Clear conversation is always the mature way to go.  [u/ssj\_cule](https://www.reddit.com/user/ssj_cule/) How very well you have explained the things that I feel, observe but am never amble to express. I can't express my inner self, my feelings in words but damn oh damn how well you have worded it.

Can anyone who is reading this give me advice on how to fucking tell people how I feel? Please. If you think about this too much you may end up with bipolar disorder II or manic depressive disorder. That's what the other guy told me. Aur sunao chote miyaan 🤣 [deleted] I don’t agree with the arranged marriage part. Consider my real life story. I was in a emotionally abusive and manipulative relationship with a narcissistic girl. Now, she got married to someone else through arranged marriage. Yes, i still haven’t completely moved on as it’s hardly been 3 weeks but I’m happy now that I realised I actually got out of a really toxic relationship with a shitty bitch. Not my problem anymore, she is now someone else’s problem.

But think about that guy. Initially, now I guess everything might be going on well and sweet between them but some day or the other, all that emotional manipulation tactics and shit are going to come out. That guy got a pretty bad deal in my opinion and it’s only a matter of time before it comes out. It’s not about If, it’s about when. So, my question is, do you want to be that guy later on in your life and then be stuck for the rest of your life with that person? They hardly met and decided everything within 2 weeks. Within 2 weeks, you don’t have any real chance of finding out if that person is a narcissist, psychopath or immature or anything else until that person acts out very clearly and you pick on the signs. And initially everything goes on nice and good only but you cannot really hope for true love and deep understanding with your partner with these kinds of stuff. 

What’s the reasonable assurance that in arranged marriage you find a partner well suited for you? Just saying, arranged marriages also don’t work always. Imagine your pain if you stayed away from dating due to this bullshit and then got into arranged marriage which may or may not work either. Big if true.

Jokes aside, in conjunction with the underlying point of your post, the main problem with the dating scene in India isn't ""older generations treating dating as a taboo"" or anything similar as most people.

In general, Indians value appearance so much that it pretty much is a game of finding someone who's perceived as the same amount of physical attractiveness as you (which is so ridiculous, attractiveness is a subjective thing). I am willing to bet that 90% of our current ""dating"" age population wouldn't be able to find a partner worth dating if they suddenly went blind I'll read your whole post in a bit but, man, your prologue though. I've been noticing this trend lately. Never ever ever apologise for being a dude and for just speaking your thoughts as one. I'm sure you'll be called a bunch of names already. Ignore them. Own it up like you're the boss of yourself. Is there a silver bug I want to be friends with you bro. I don’t know I have never been through the situation which you mentioned, even though I have got more approvals than rejections. I have always read the fine print to sense what’s going on with the other person. So, IMO I would say the guy is to blame for not understanding the situation and letting anyone walk over him. I am 18 and I don't feel like having a gf at all at any point of time (had a short relationship when i was 16) , have many female friends, even got proposed by a girl few months back but i politely rejected her, although the girl was very nice, i couldn't have found a girl like her even if i was looking. All my friends talk about getting a gf all the time but i just don't want to.

Is something wrong with me? 
Does any of you have similar thoughts?

P.s- I'm a perfectly straight guy. There are  no ugly men. There are unfit and fat men. That being said, even an average looking guy can improving himself. 

Lift heavy in the Gym. If you are overweight, try losing extra fat. 
Wearing good fitting clothes that compliment your body type. 

Last but not the least, be confidence in your own skin. Realise women are also human and not some angelic creatures. They have flaws and don't stress out too much if a girl rejects you. 

Keep on improving yourself and you shall be rewarded :) By expressing feelings very visibly, we give them too much power. She can friendzone you and have multiple guys in the DMs because she knows she can get away with it. She won't say no because she having you there waiting for her to say yes empowers her.
Don't make your feelings very visible, make her interested in you and then ask her out. Don't make her feel too good or comfortable.
That sense of uncertainty makes things so much easier. I am conflicted about this post. There are bits of maturity but then the rest of it is a combination of pyaar ka panchnama + Quora. r/niceguys Feel for you bro, I was lucky enough to get an underlying “fuck off” tone in a straight up “NO” in every single one of my attempts. I don’t want to go back to feeling unwanted and undesirable so I simply stopped interacting with the opposite sex unless it’s a professional or friendly setting, couldn’t be any happier! I relate.

But honestly, why does like every other comment have silver? Let me tell you something. Women are very shallow. First thing they notice in a guy is looks : Height, face and body. Third is optional. Even the ugly and fat girls want a hot guy nowadays, thanks to online dating. If you want to save yourself the emotional torture, stop going after girls. If a girl is not showing interest it just means she is not attracted to you. If she is attracted to you, you won't even have to try hard. Just chase your life goals man and focus on yourself. Randia wale Kuch bhi upvote krte hai, this post is wrong on so many levels. If you guys agree with it then may God help you in your married life when you're going to be around a women for more than half your life [deleted] Lol. Lot of average looking guys I see getting girls. Stop trying to victimize yourself for the reddit karma and actually change the way you approach dating.

GG r/India, you just gave tons of upvotes to an incel/NiceGuy dude. Typical, probably boring nice guy who is ""oh so caring"" got rejected.

Yeah, the girl was rude, but without knowing the full story I'm not gonna judge her. For all we know you could be the clingiest dude, difficult and awkward to say no to. Definitely seems so given you have the time to type this much on Reddit. /r/IncelTears r/inceltears losers /r/awardspeechedits",Entertainment,2019-06-11 14:12:39

>* The more sophisticated argument given by those who support Khans exit is that his views on Indian intolerance were incompatible with his role as brand ambassador for promoting India as a tourist destination.

>* Probably not, for the TV spots all projected the actor as hero in the micro stories involving harassment of foreign tourists, and that too in the typical black-and-white approach favoured by Bollywood.

>* In one, some goons are harassing two foreign women tourists and Aamir enters the picture as a typical Bollywood hero who arrives in the nick of time to rescue the damsels in distress.

>* The Athithi Devo Bhava campaign, while well intentioned, is unlikely to make an impact on public behaviour for the simple reason that it has the typical Bollywood masala film which is meant as entertainment and escapism, not about changing attitudes.

***Pros:*** Several times cheaper than getting cable + Hindi language pack. Need only internet connection. Good for parents when they come visiting and want to watch news or follow some specific shows on native language channels. Pay-per-view movies are only for $2.

***Cons:*** Good for watching NDTV India, NDTV 24x7, some Bollywood music channels and some language channels (for me, Zee Marathi, Star Pravaha, Zee 24 taas). Channels like Zee TV, Sony, Star TV, Colors etc do not stream. ",indiaman," which country? You can also try Jadoo TV if you are not in India - problem is very slow live telecast only during US hours from what I heard. Yes, I had it when my parents came this summer for 6 months. They are worth it specially with 10 days ondemand play. 

I had a telugu pack and I ended up watching only news channels for entertainment. In telugu news channels show more entertainment content than pure entertainment channels.",Entertainment,2013-10-20 23:59:15

This so much does not make sense: Vidya Balan is special guest at HindustanTimes Leadership summit,7,myn3r,http://www.hindustantimes.com/photos-news/Photos-Entertainment/vidyabalanfarhanakhtaratleadershipsummit/Article4.aspx,5,,Manoos," It makes perfect sense. News is entertainment is business is profits. Everything merges seamlessly into one ugly package.  Association of Indian film stars with anything apart from entertainment does not make sense. But, the media exposure specially with her new movie is worth it. 
 Makes perfect sense. These conferences are really for networking and getting to know people.

Like it or not, movie stars know all the right people and have connections. ""Leaders"" want to get to know them both for the prestige of having someone like Vidya Balan as a ""friend"" and also so they can use each other to access each other's personal networks. What part of her hotness doesn't make any sense to you? She might be a good actor, but how has she really displayed leadership? ",Entertainment,2011-12-03 19:17:55

"Indian/Canadian movie ""Breakaway"" using an abused circus Asian elephant",7,kcp68,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/kcp68/indiancanadian_movie_breakaway_using_an_abused/,4,"Last night in Toronto Canada, There was a Bollywood style premier for the movie *Breakaway* at the Toronto Film Festival (TIFF). This movie stars Russell Peters and Vinay Virmani.  An Elephant named Limba was rented from the local Bowmanville zoo. Picture: http://yfrog.com/h7iqwawnj The Elephant was brought into downtown Toronto with the lights , cameras , drunks and noise to help promote the movie. It was a fancy entrance along with dancers and music in the streets.  

What is sad about this whole situation is seeing  fellow South Asians being so ignorant of the abuse these Asian elephants have had to go through in North America. This elephant in particular has a very sad past. Living her life in the circus and being chained and beat to perform ridiculous acts for the public. Then to be rented out like a slave to  Indians no less for a movie and rides is the most sad and disgusting of things to happen.
 
Here is more about her life:

http://www.kulone.com/CA/Event/2250493-Evening-Protest-against-Circus-Mondo-animal-exploiters
.

""Mondo Circus is a Quebec based circus. who's tradition is animal abuse.

Confined to a life of misery, traveling in cramped cages and transport
trailers are cats, dogs, camels, baboons, ponies, horses, a jaguar. tiger and Limba the 47 year old Asian female elephant on loan from the Bowman ville zoo who's own history of elephant abuse and deaths is notorious.

...Limba was born in the wild and was torn away from her mother and herd some time after she was born to be tormented, shackled whipped and beaten to perform ridiculous and unnatural tricks for the entertainment industry. Her exploitation and torture has continued to this day.

Limba and the two camels while being forced to travel thousands of miles were in an accident, the truck they were in rolled over.

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2008/06/16/circus-crash.html

One of the two owners of Bowman ville Zoo, Michael Hackenberger, has been publicly accused on several occasions of mistreating elephants. For example, in 2002, a Winnipeg Humane Society media release indicated that Hackenberger had flown to Winnipeg to discipline an elephant that he had loaned to the Assiniboine Park Zoo. The elephant, Limba, had attacked a keeper at the zoo, so, according to the release, “Limba’s owner flew into Winnipeg from his home in Ontario following the attack, purchased a whip and electric prod at a local livestock supply company and beat the elephant as a reprisal for the attack.



The enslavement of animals for the sake of entertainment must end.

For Tyke shown in the profile picture, Limba and all of the other animals of this circus and others who have been raped of their natural existence just to be used and discarded for the sole purpose of profiteering and exploitation""",zerop4p," The movie [EARTHLINGS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQbeL-Hw00c) shows that while animal and elephant torture by their handlers is not uncommon in many parts of the world, it is always sick, twisted and disgusting.

It breaks the heart and wounds the soul. I wish peace for poor Limba.

However, you may want to check out the following places during weekends.

Pradhyuman Park
Nyari Dam
Aji Dam
Zoo
Swami vivekanand temple
Dolls museum - yagnik road

You can join a social club such as Sargam Club.

make a group with folks at race course morning walk.
Join badminton at indoor stadium.

And you may hangout at ring road at night.

There's nothing much to do here honestly.
