Malayalis in Germany protest after Hindu groups object to serving of beef at Indian food fest,477,cyrfxh,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/malayalis-in-germany-protest-after-hindu-groups-object-to-serving-of-beef-at-indian-food-fest-1594656-2019-09-02,168,,netflixo," Chutiyas go to a country famous for beer and its sausages (pork & beef)... and protest serving of beef on German soil! Same chutiya group support the pro-Nazi groups in hating Muslims and ""halal"" food. Oh man..we are just f*cking bunch of parasites spreading shits wherever we go... They happily go and eat in german restaurants selling beef, they suck upto beef eating Germans..but if their own people sells beef or eat beef, then they go nutsss...! Hypocrites...! Foreign me bhi ye hutiyapa Shuru ho gaya. This reminds me of that Hasan Minaj bit where he compares the Indian diaspora to a biryani ""Keep the weird shit out and bring the good stuff in"" FFS I'm hindu and those assholes don't represent me. Just like the Taliban doesn't represent Muslims. Anyone can eat what they want. Honestly I would stand with these guys and tell those wound ups to fuck right off Objection on beef in Germany? Motherfuckers, this is the land of beef and pork. Fuckers, go back to India. Why the fuck are you even in Germany? Go back inside Modi's arse and eat dhokla. I suppose they were serving Porota Beef.
No one comes in between a Malayali and his porota beef. Objecting beef in Germany? Lol, these guys are unbelievable. If you can't tolerate people with different eating habits, maybe you shouldn't be living in places where people have different eating habits than you. Just stay home back in India if you're so close minded. This is is stupid , if you dont wanna eat then dont eat the beef , why restricting others bc puri duniya k samne ijaat ka kachra kar rahe hai ye narrow minded bhadwe. How much common sense can anyone lack to understand food pyramid, human history and HUMANITY. Keep crying bitch supreme leader modi doesn't have jurisdiction in Germany Well the Malayalis should have boycotted the event. Fuck these RW nuts. Peace Why such compulsion?? If you don’t like beef don’t eat it! Let others enjoy! 😑 Aise log India ko har jagah badnaam krte hai. Germany jaakr bhi berozgaar ho to isse acha vapis aa jao. These assholes can't leave people in peace anywhere in god damn world. Don't go and settle in beef eating countries. Oh that would be India, the country you left in the first place. Now sanghi pigs have started spreading their cancer abroad. Idiots protesting other idiots.

Its an ""Indian"" food fest. Not a ""Hindu"" food fest.  25% of Indians have no prohibition against beef and do eat beef.

What moronic times we live in. Just so you guys know it's part of Hindu Culture to eat beef. Sad day - CGI Germany bowed down to goons Maybe they should come right back. Bitches These extremists don't decide what is Indian culture.  There are several states where beef is eaten.

""Kerala, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura and West Bengal are the states where there are no restrictions on cow slaughter.""

Indian culture isn't based on what a majority does either. If that is the case then lynchings would also have to be considered as an Indian culture. 

In the case of beef Some Indians eat it some don't. So if you are a part of India you can't say that your country doesn't eat beef. If you want to say that then you aren't talking about India anymore.

It isn't against Indian culture to eat beef.

It isn't against Hinduism to eat beef either. Because there are many texts that show that beef was consumed by hindus for years. The most these extremists can say it is that their political parties and groups don't eat beef, ie bjp,rss,etc. Go mallus!✨😂 > However, some right-wing Hindu organisations raised objections over the menu, saying that serving beef was a ""direct attack on Indian culture"" and **threatened to create a ruckus during the festival.**

Clear case of CGI Frankfurt getting bogged down by what can be called terrorists or atleast mafia What are these idiots doing outside the country then?? Fuckers... Come back to your UP style Yogi-rajya if you want to follow your version of shuddh indian culture.

Fucktards. Do these north Indians never visit a German resturant, or drive out Germans from other food fairs where I'm pretty sure some beef would be common?. Oh no. There they must integrate and be diverse. Yeah just when we have ou diverse culture on display, they want it shudh shakahari. Not in a non nazi regime my aryans. From what I know of cultural/food festivals, foreign embassies ask their expatriates to present the culture of their home country in the form of food, movies, books, drama, souvenirs to the natives. It is a way for the natives(Germans in this case), to experience the culture of other countries(India). 

Sanghis objected to Kerala stall serving beef as though Kerala culture cannot be presented to the Germans as Indian food. 

You can be sure that Sanghis would have also exercised control through their thug organisations to decide what movies and books would have been presented to the Germans.

It is important to understand this larger fight of control over what defines India, rather than look at this as just another instance of Sanghis preventing Keralites consuming beef. The event was called ""Indian Vegetarian Food Fest"". Here is the coverage from German national broadcaster: https://m.dw.com/hi/%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AF-%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%95/g-50275074

 Indian embassy organized that in remembrance of 150 years of Gandhi.

I don't understand why this protest when the event was openly called vegetarian food festival. Here's the reason why malayalis/Keralites whatever u prefer are protesting.  Ig as a Malayali I can speak for

FACTS :- 1)  NRI's in Germany are mostly Malayali's like most of the NRI's in Singapore are from Tamil Nadu and Punjabi's in Canada.

 2) Hindu/Christian/Muslim/Areligious  Malayali's eat beef in general in Kerala since it's one of the only States where beef (cow meat)  is legal. 

REASON :-  Quite simple they feel their preferences are being ignored coz Christian's eat all poultry meats, Hindu's don't eat beef, Muslims don't eat pork. You see where I am getting at? You can't satisfy everyone so it leads to conflict. 

Why is it happening now? Increase in population of Muslim/Christian NRI's in Germany. 

Can we enjoy diversity in peace? No coz diversity always leads to conflict no matter how optimistic you're. [deleted]",Food,2019-09-03 00:44:06

"Nestle Violates Law in India, Conducts Clinical Trials on Premature Infants for Baby Food",1010,cllkgq,https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/nestle-violates-law-in-india-conducts-clinical-trials-on-premature-infants-for-baby-food,109,,thewebdev," > Dr Monjoni Mitra of Medclin Research is the trial co-ordinator and research director of the trial. The five hospitals which participated in the research — Cloudnine Hospital (Bengaluru), Institute of Child Health (Kolkata), Manipal Hospital (Bengaluru), Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (New Delhi) and Calcutta Medical Research Institute (Kolkata)— are private institutions. R Kishore Kumar, Apurba Ghosh, Ravi Shankar Swamy, Neelam Kher and Saugata Acharyya were the doctors involved in these respective hospitals for the trials.

Putting the names of the offending doctors and hospitals involved in the racket. xpost this is /r/worldnews and other subs.

Name and shame. Nestle is the most evil corporation ever. Whenever there is a thread on askreddit about evil companies Nestle is always on the top Sick I dont know why im surprised, fuck nestle How come no government is able to reign in nestle effectively? Maybe it’s too powerful as a company Nestle is a kind of a serial offender of a company. How the fuck do these fucking companies have the gall to do such shady stuff in India and not in US? First Johnson and Johnson and now Nestle. > Breaking the law, Nestle has conducted clinical trials on 75 premature babies in five hospitals on substitutes for breast milk in complete contravention of the Infant Milk Substitutes Act. It was found by Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI) on screening the trial registry of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that Nestle has sponsored a research titled “Multicentric Observational Study to Observe Growth in Preterm hospitalised infants”.

> The trial was conducted on 75 premature babies between the age of 28-34 weeks. The objective of the study was to assess the growth and feeding intolerance in preterm infants. One of the exclusions was that the infant could not be fed milk substitute within 48 hours of birth, but from the third day onwards, the trial suggested that the infant could be given a milk substitute instead of breast milk.

> ... *“They are conducting these trials on premature babies. It is extremely risky. Babies are most sensitive during this period. What would have happened if anything went wrong with these babies,”* asks Amulya Nidhi, co-convenor of Swasth Adhikar Manch. There's no point posting this here and becoming outraged, if you're not actively doing anything to boycott their products. * **Nestle Board Meeting**
* CEO:  People hated the whole ""Water isn't a human right"" thing, but we're  losing steam on that story. What can we do to stir the hate up even  more? H-he hungers for it. He grows weary.
* Board member 1: What about fucking with people's dogs? Everyone loves dogs.
* CEO: Hmm. I like it. Evil, but we can go eviler, I'm sure of it.

* CEO:  Y-yes. Perfect. Premature babies. Mister Shkreli and Mister Beiber,  you're dismissed. Start rounding up a sample cohort of premature babies.  Cthulu and I will stay here and work out the details. These are the companies we need to boycott. Not Zomato or Snapdeal Boycott Nestle Hope they get fined to oblivion Cross post this to /r/hydrohomies 

They loathe Nestle and can possibly make this news viral. Why is Nestle suddenly violating laws in India? Is it looking to join BJP? Ok I guess some proper information needs to be given here. I am a medical Prof who has done fair share of research across international papers and so I can tell abt these studies and what is the ACTUAL problem.

1. First of all, clinical trials on premature babies are done all the time. Observational studies, randomized control trials are done occasionally and hence it is not 'BARBARIC'. These trials are done precisely to know whether the treatment options that we have are even worth it or not. 

The substitute for breast milk is actually necessary especially when mother is not lactating and you need to feed breast milk to baby. The suckling reflex hasn't developed in premature baby and hence they need to be given from outside. Sometimes breast milk is just not available or is inadequate and hence a substitute is absolutely necessary.

2. Ok now comes this study. First of all, any study of such type is always done after ethical clearance AND after consent from the parents. This is true for all subjects of any study. Most probably there is a case control study here where some premat babies are fed normal breast milk and some are fed with substitute milk. And then the growth is seen. After the result the subjects are always shifted back to standard therapy .

Again consent is always taken.

3. Now we say any Nestle. The thing which Nestle did was break the law which said THEY CANT GIVE MONETARY OR OTHER BENEFIT TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. Nestle is a company which is creating a new product. That is fine. They have to get it tested in clinical trials. That is completely fine as well. The researchers have to do it in respective hospitals with proper place for premat babies and a NICU etc etc. That is fine as well.

However giving benefits to the researcher involved for a skewed result? That is not ok. 

Starting research before official ethical clearence certificate? That is not ok.

Basically if the wordings of this article are correct, then the problem is that Nestle is most prob hiring researchers on their own terms and hence the study isn't exactly unbiased...

4. Is it harmful to babies? It depends really. If they are shifted back to current gold standard of treatment after results and everything else is ensured ( see their exclusion criteria is pretty good). Then it won't hurt them. However is the results are skewed when they are actually not useful then it can be harmful for further babies who receive them in subsequent trials. Hence why unbiased research is really important in clinical trials.

So everyone, hold your horses. It is not as unethical as you are thinking. They are not killing babies here nor are they doing something absolutely horrible. However it does become unethical when it is forming an unbiased research. That should be condemmned. 

Research is a wonderful thing and we should do it unbiased to help everyone involved. Nowhere is any mention of penalizing the company. Is there any provision of penalty or prosecution for the company involved. Man. Nestle is fucked up
And I thought I was being healthy by eating nestle products India is/becoming the guinea pig for experiments of the western world! Do the parents know that their infant is part of such trials? Does the doctor or anyone else inform them? Ugh There real question should be , what are we going to do about it? Congress mouthpiece is doing better journalism than many so-called neutral outlets like Republic.  I'm not even suprised tho! Nestle has a reputation of going to third world countries and doing shit like this. They are honestly, EVIL! How much evil shit can be leveraged over Maggi noodles Evil scum, its hard but I try my best to stay away from their products Don't they already have premature baby food? Pure evil! I kinda thought they would learn something after starving and infecting to death babies of perfectly healthy mothers. Nope, they were just waiting for another unsuspecting people. Is there a subreddit for the types of this post Unrelated to topics , What are substitute for Nestle cerelax , I have baby I am giving it as supplement food Looks like patanjali about to launch similar products.. just giving baba headstart.

We have a liking for masala, colorful and relatively more salty stuff relatively. To a general Indian audience (not the health conscious minority) a rich red/orange gravy will look more appealing than a white looking pasta dish or a grilled meat with seasoning. 

Hence from a manufacturers perspective, if they want to sell in India then they have to adapt to the local taste and tip on the unhealthy side of the scale by adding more salt sugar and color.

"India’s Restaurants Rebel Against Food Delivery Apps: Frustrated by the steep commissions and discounts that apps like Zomato and Uber Eats push on restaurants, thousands have started a movement to #Logout from them.",93,cz4z2q,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/technology/india-restaurants-logout-delivery-zomato.html,19,,OrneryReflection," I don't want to go to a restaurant and wait for my food for 20 minutes. I'd rather wait for my food for 40 minutes at home. I'm a Zomato Gold user who was perplexed when a restaurant I frequent suddenly stopped accepting Zomato Gold. Although I sort of argued with them (mildly), once I did my research on it, I fully understand why restaurants would do this. 

In the long run, all this discounting will only hurt both restaurants and customers since restaurants need a margin to run on. They'll have to make up for it somehow and usually it's by increasing prices. 

Customers pay Zomato for Zomato Gold, restuarants pay Zomato to be a part of the Zomato Gold program (else they'll lose visibility -- that's how Zomato sells the whole thing), restaurants take the losses due to the discounts and on top of all this they even pay Zomato a commission per order. 

I just don't get what sort of value add Zomato does with its Gold program. (Sure, it has a nice review platform (so does Google) and it needs to make money somehow -- but this is stupid).

If Zomato Gold manages to capture more and more restaurants all that will happen is the price without the Gold program will increase. And we'll be paying Zomato money every year to eat out at ""normal"" prices which will be the new discounted price. That's assuming Zomato captures more of the market. Hopefully they don't! I am frustrated with how expensive online food ordering is. Goodluck to all the restaurants with the #logout campaign. Delivery services :

\- They take so much money from restaurant : at least 20 to 25% if you ask them.

\- They are source of so much plastic garbages

\- Their drivers are so dangerous (for us and for themselves)

Using them is somehow supporting this isnt it ?

&#x200B;

Personally we use the app to check menus and then we go to the restaurant. :D A lot of people found bottlenecks in the program such as , visiting one restaurant for biriyani and another for sweets only (if you only end up selling only the sweets when you've already made a ton of other stuff you will make a loss). Then there were people using other peoples membership. Some literally took away tons of food using the unlimited clause and paid very less, and kept doing it everyday :P :P 

Basically it was a case of a poorly thought out plan where the loss-bearer was someone else. Zomato has since made changes to the program to plug the loopholes.",Food,2019-09-03 21:36:22

The witch's broth,648,cswj9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cswj9h/the_witchs_broth/,237,"The words, ""Taj Mahal was not built by Shahjahan. It was a Shiva temple."" still rings in my ears. My aunt who never had anything beyond primary school education told me so when I was a kid. My grandmother who never went to school knew that the first atom bomb was detonated in Kurukshetra during the battle between Pandavas and Kauravas in Mahabharata. Apparently, this is why not a shred of grass grows in Kurukshetra. Of course, she had not been to Kurukshetra and she had no idea about nuclear physics. But as a child, I had no reason to doubt their wisdom.

It is said that ignorance is bliss. But I firmly believe that ignorance is a curse. It corrupts the mind of the people. Our ignorant grandparents, uncles and aunts, parents have systematically, though not necessarily deliberately, shoved us towards ignorance and false pride. Their inadequate knowledge blended with haughty confidence has rendered most Indians into pompous fools.

These fools were relegated mostly to tasks that did not need intellectual acumen. They did their servile jobs and nurtured the pride that Ganesha had the first plastic surgery. They did their thankless duties and passed on their ignorance to their children. But someday, these fools had to come to prominence and they did. They started winning elections.

The electoral system is terribly flawed. It allows ignorants, uneducated people, idiots to become candidates and since power and money are all that is required, these imbeciles inevitably win elections. But it is not just power and money. People vote. If the people are uneducated, they would not know the value of education and they would help elect ignorants. And so they did. They elected those who would tell them how great a people they are and how quickly they would lead the world. In other words, they elected those who would give them the illusion of becoming a superpower or *Vishwaguru*.

Now that the ignoramus became leaders, it was no longer required to surreptitiously suggest that Newton did not discover the laws of gravity. The buffoons started finding Indic greatness in just about everything and made it their sacred duty to vomit their crazy thoughts publicly. They started investing effort in meaningless researches such as finding the suitability of Sanskrit in programming talking computers. But I hold responsible not just those who never went to school, for being ignorant. Such is the pathetic condition of the education system in India that having MS in Physics is also not enough to make a person educated in Physics or else why would a former lecturer of physics claim that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is found in Vedas? Why would a judge claim that peacocks reproduce with their tears? Why would another judge declare that Brahmins are born twice? Why would an MBBS claim that the Vedas postulated a theory superior to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity? These people did go to schools and universities. But unfortunately, these schools and universities failed to give them an education. These universities washed off their hands having given these duffers just their qualification. I blame the worthless education system of India for the burden of ignorance these cretins carry exactly on their shoulders as much I hold responsible the ignorant parents these people had.

When ignorants come to power, they lead the country towards intellectual bankruptcy. It heralds the onset of disaster for a nation. Such a scenario was seen during the 1930s in Germany when the Nazis came to power. They claimed weird and unfounded theories about science, anthropology and history. They invested time, manpower and money in worthless researches. They promoted occultism and pseudoscience. They made racial laws based on pseudo-Darwinism.

When ignorants achieve power, they also want glory. They cook up stories of a great past that have made them a great race. It pumps false pride and prejudices in the people. It propels society towards collective lunacy. To assert their perceived supremacy, such a deluded nation ends up declaring war on other nations. Whether India follows such a destructive path or not, will be seen in a very near future. But the symptoms are already visible. There is a witch's broth being cooked, a diabolical concoction of patriotism, pseudoscience, the glorification of the past, nationalism, occultism, militarism and ignorance. India is going down a slippery slope.",insen2000," I would like to add a few more points

Our education is failure maybe because our society is obsessed with percentages rather than the knowledge gained. The evaluation is so flawed that if you know the tricks you can literally write a movie script for any question and still score full marks for it.

People with degrees who earned it by cheating, tricking, and false evaluation are no less than the uneducated and ignorant mass. Some of these people again use loopholes in the job market and attain high positions in companies only to belittle the hardworking ones. There was a country of imbeciles, all of whom secretly harbored delusions of their own greatness.

But they were ruled by a select few who, while being of the same stock as the imbeciles, had risen above their level of stupidity by virtue of having access to an education system that was denied to the vast majority.

This elite took advantage of the general brainlessness that prevailed among the masses, and ruled over them simply by impressing upon them that they *were* stupid, and needed someone intelligent to rule over them. 

But this went on for long enough, and then some among the many woke up to the fact that if the imbeciles were in a majority, why not instil among them the idea that their imbecility, far from being a bane, was in fact a virtue? Thus, they could overthrow the elite - who had in any case let generations of opulent living dull them into a lazy corpulence - and become the rulers themselves.

This worked better than even they had hoped, for the imbeciles were tired of whispering their inanities among the like-minded few - or so they had thought. In fact, the mindless were an overwhelming majority. Upon realizing that for the first time, the rulers did not look down upon their stupidity, but in fact echoed their inane blathering, they began in ever-increasing numbers to shout out evidence of their own idiocy from the rooftops. 

Thus, for the first time in this country's history, the ruled had found themselves in complete harmony with their rulers. > They cook up stories of a great past that have made them a great race.

\-Joseph de Maistre I live in the UAE and I used to wonder how ISIS took over Syria. Last month my Syrian neighbor said, ""We all supported ISIS because they talked about our religion, nationalism and the most glorious past of Syria that they were trying to bring back. We all stood by and watched as ISIS massacred our own brothers and sisters because they promised to make Syria great again, the saddle of creation that it once was, the real Syria that the whole world respected . But they just wanted to make some money from our oil fields."" This government is of the unkils, by the unkils and for the unkils.

We should thank our luck for there still being such a thing as internet.

I taught myself evolution by natural selection until I grokked it thanks to the internet (especially books by Dawkins and BBC and PBS documentaries). I taught myself interesting ideas discovered by astronomy thanks to the Teaching Company. I learned to be skeptic and think critically thanks to Novella's Skeptic Guide to the Universe podcast. I learned about how our debt-based world economy has been stuttering through booms and busts since Nixon's 1971 decision. I learned from Nate Hagens about how surplus energy is the driver of economy, not money. I learned what science has learned about plants by watching Chamovitz course on Coursera.

I learned why Indian science didn't develop after 1200 A.D. by watching [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmhnQR7xxRg) by Breakthrough Science Society.

You won't believe how awed I feel every day.

But I also understand that the civilization as we know it is heading for collapse by 2050. So, there's some sadness too. I am *learning to die in the anthropocene*. You fail to understand education system. Education is nothing more than a social experiment. It only helps the individual to conform to the societal norms. Societal norms keep on changing with the tide of time. The current acceptability standards in Indian context are towards a majoritarian cultural and nationalistic tendencies. Education will only fall in line to create individuals who conform to those standards. Just wow!

In India, a lot of us are not well educated. We are expensively educated.... In 1453, just before the fall of the city, the intellectuals of Constantinople were discussing the gender of angels. Who are you, bro? Remember, all these crazy shit is brought forward by people brave enough to speak such bs.


Who knows how much more crazy thoughts they have they don't bring out? > There is a witch's broth being cooked, a diabolical concoction of patriotism, pseudoscience, the glorification of the past, nationalism, occultism, militarism and ignorance. India is going down a slippery slope.

This line basically hits the nail on the head for me. For a while I've kinda thought about what Nationalism was and how different is it from Patriotism (I'm just picking these two for now, but willing to talk about the others as well).


I basically came to the my current conclusion ( I might be quite wrong, so please correct me if you believe so). 


Patriotism is where we believe in the idea of the country that it was founded on. In our case a Secular, Democratic Republic. A land where all are welcome regardless of their beliefs, religion, caste, creed, race or anything people have used to differentiate each other (for better or for worse). A land where the people choose, elect and stand by the those they have elected to lead and govern(Not rule over). Place where diversity is celebrated, protected and understood.


Nationalism is this idea that one person or group of persons are superior to others and they alone have the right to rule over all the others. The others are basically on this earth to destroy it and therefore need to be subjugated and herded (Or ruled). Or in some cases destroyed so as to purify the race. Differences are highlighted and weaponized to gain power. 

So, when I hear people calling themselves Nationalistic or group of nationalists, it does worry me since I see them as possibly being so enslaved by this idea of superiority that they will be willing to do anything for it. And that is scary. quality post right here. Germans had very advanced tech for those times but the majority populace were systematically brainwashed  into thinking that the jews were main reason  for all their problems. Thank you so much for writing this. Sanity is refreshing these days. Now all we’ve got to do is SHOUT this from FUCKING ROOFTOPS!! The biggest flaw in everything you've written is that you think that these rulers believe in what they say. They don't, they just have to make you think they do. Judges have to pass exams, or win cases as lawyers before they are so elevated. 

It is the easiest conclusion. When your staying in power depends on you lying to the people about a non-existent past, as a power hungry, devious and clever politician, will you pander to the millions and millions of uneducated/semi-educated, or to the handful of people who will try to counter you with science in a battle which science cannot win? Iv come to realise that the biggest failure of our education system is that it has not taught critical thinking/reasoning skills to people. I see it on my WhatsApp groups where educated people are ready to believe any kind of fake news conforming to their wordviews. People who pride themselves on their technical knowledge and look at data 10 times before coming to a conclusion, are ready to accept any BS in terms of politics or history. We are happy to accept anything told to us by a person in authority. Because that's what schools and parents have taught us to do. Listen to elders, do not question, write the answer exactly in this format to score marks etc. This seems like a very good essay with words coming straight out of the heart of someone who cares for his/her country. I agree with all the points you made. You correctly pointed out the issues in our education system, social fabric etc which are now transcending to an unprecedented national level. And it is really worrisome but then who will voice them when we can't even do it in front of our relatives and closed friends. 

They have taken the blue pill and want to live their ignorant lives not actually caring about this at all. In their view, they are deep patriotic because they are supporting a buffoon who seems to have patented this so called nationalism. 
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing that we have one. Unless this happens, there is no bright future. 
If we want to rise up as a society, we need to develop a scientific temperament. We need to rely on facts rather than rumors. We need to question everything we can. And a good education will only take you so far, it will be ultimately this very society which will make or break our future (which seems to be going downhill for some time) I want to take a peek at your bookshelf, OP. Well now that we have, once again, identified the problems, what is going to fix the country?
If the plan is - criticise so that people get aware...I'm sorry but that's not gonna work. 

Suppose I am a bhakt and I start seeing that BJP is not what I had in mind....I pay attention to you and wake up.

What do I do next?

Do I vote for Congress / SP-BSP / INLD / TMC / TDP etc?

I can present examples of religious bigotry and stupidity from all of these parties. As many as from BJP. 

What do I do, as an individual, when my choices are limited like this? A couple days ago i overhead a conversation among 3 people for 10 seconds while doing some work. This guy started by saying to the other two, ""Hey have you guys heard about Kashmir, i have no idea but i think ...."" And the other two also agreed that they have no idea about the facts of the matter and continued say utter bullshit and some communal things too.


I just sighed, got up and left. Would it kill people to just pick up a good newspaper and fucking read a paragraph or two about the thing and then talk? Just read about the damn facts if you want to talk or voice your opinion about anything. Wish we had an Ataturk somewhere , don't know if that is even possible in an fractious democracy such as ours Very well written post. Would love to hear your solution to this. Well written mate..👍 What you said is actually quite true. And it's not just our education system but the social media as well as news media. I am a resident of Kolhapur which was a victim of the recent flood disaster. We the residents did everything in our to save the lives of those who were affected by the flood. And I didn't see a single media person who talked about that instead it was just who took a press conference and talked and whatnot. The Media is blind about the real situation that they will start to blame anyone without even knowing the real issue. And I feel ashamed to admit that in our country it matters a lot. None of the leaders keep their promises and play the same tape for the next elections. And it's literally unimaginable but also very true that the people fall for the same thing again and again and again like a sheep. It's disgusting. If anyone of you had read the Shiva Trilogy/The Ram Chandra Series of books, then there's a really cool philosophy that was presented by Amish Tripathi in the books. Dunno if the philosophy is actually his, but, that was my first source of this information.

It states that the system of governance, and the region of governance, both follow a cyclic mode, of switching between two systems, called as the ""masculine"" system, and the ""feminine"" system. The feminine system, is based on freedom, creativity, and a light structure to allow said creativity to flourish and grow the system. The masculine system, is based on rigid rules, duty, and honour of service etc. 

As you can see, they are entirely opposite systems, and hence, clash heavily with each other.

Unfortunately for India, we might be in some sort of a transition from a feminine system, to a masculine system, within Democracy, which doesn't make much sense, as democracy works best with a feminine system. Sure, the People take forever to debate and make a correct decision, but, at the end, there's not much doubt about its correctness. On the other hand, decisions in the masculine system are swift, and very strongly executed, although there's no time for the public to determine whether it's right or wrong, before the decision is finalized.

At Their doomtimes, feminine systems become corrupt and unjust, and people wish for a masculine system. In the same way, a masculine system becomes fanatical, clinging to old Glory, not letting it go and restart, and hence, falls to forced implementation of a feminine system, mostly due to some sort of a war.

I hope we don't come to this sort of a fanatical end. This is very good writing. Considering this is your first post it's make it more enjoyable (I don't know exact word I want to use) Is it just me or neither have my parents nor grandparents nor my aunts or uncles have told me or any of my cousins Ganesha has plastic surgery or Kurukshetra had an atom bomb dropped on it or that Taj Mahal was a Shiv temple Easy to state problems. What are the solutions? Wonderful Do you have a fix? Hilarious that you used Germany as an example. The modern day advancements of US, Russia etc have a lot to do with what they pillaged from Germany after the war including soft power.  
Better that you read more about it ? Very well thought and written. Rapists and mob lynchers are given garlands in our country. Supreme court and the constitution is in the BJPs pocket. जैसी प्रजा वैसा राजा. Any solutions for this ? Anyway to reverse this brainwash? 

I am agonised and feel helpless watching people turning into insensitive, hateful and communal bigots over these past 5 years, even those people who were largely neutral or never showed too much interest in politics.

I can easily emigrate , But I don't want to. Because I have many good friends and relatives here, my family business is doing very well and I work at a Indian MNC. I don't want to abandon all of this just because some nazi party is in power. What a brilliant post. Mind blowingly accurate. I wish I could be as articulate as you about this.

Edit: You need to submit it to some newspaper. Are you a journalist? > Now that the ignoramus became leaders

> The buffoons started finding Indic greatness

> When ignorants come to power

> When ignorants achieve power

This kind of language doesn't help things. Snobbishness and elitism won't help you get your arguments across. Your opponents will shut themselves off to anything you have to say. They can easily afford to do so.

I think instead we must sincerely engage with them to understand where they are coming from. What complaints, fears or aspirations drive them? Is there anything at all of worth in their arguments? Is there anything at all that the rest of us can learn from their positions? Do we have blind spots and prejudices of our own?

It's easy to sink into despair and hate. But if we answer hatred with hatred, it will only polarize the society even further. Instead, we must work from an authentic state of compassion towards others without being patronizing. Ultimately, whether we like it or not, we're in this all together. 

You call them igorants and buffoons. Presumably you hold yourself to be a more sophisticated thinker than them. Surely using your superior knowledge and wisdom, you must be able to get them to see where you're coming from? While I agree with much of what you say, i think you're not paying the deliberate push by the leadership to get the masses to follow more and more stupider causes. Remember, the mob that pulled the mosq down in 1992 did not appear in ayodhya spontaneously. So basically this all is Nehru's fault. If only our education system was better than what it was the past 70 years ...

Not sure if to put /s or not Wow!  Well written. 
Mere 'Man Ki Baat.' While the problems you state are true, the criticism is overboard and the projection that we are heading into WW2 Germany is clear over exaggeration.

We all here agree that the problem of misinformation is mostly in the generation we term as ""unkils"" and we see them around us in our own families,does it not mean it is not entirely reflection of their views as people but the impact poor understanding of Internet and modern technology by the their generation. 

Also, winning elections and running country are entirely different things. One cannot win elections by good governance alone. So they resort to publicity tactics as well. I am not justifying the actions but what I mean is though their words make them look like fools when taken literally, they are doing it for a reason and the educated are not the target audience for those statements. [removed] Don't forget Allah split moon into 2 pieces. Fwiw this is global.  Look at the moon hoax folks, the anti vaxers or the flat landers, all of them are educated in schools and yet.... TL;DR Demagoguery. one more Mecca Medina me shiv ling, LMAO Talk about discriminatory sentiments - whatever your political leanings may be, this was a reductive and poor take on politics. Your opinion on the fake news spread by bhakts and unkils are correct. However, aren't you spreading similar things by claiming we are turning into Nazi Germany? This is exactly what the opposition did for the last 5 years. They claimed there was undeclared emergency, minorities will be sent to concentration camps etc but it was nothing but fear mongering and it played into the hands of BJP. >The words, ""Taj Mahal was not built by Shahjahan. It was a Shiva temple."" still rings in my ears.

It is an inferiority complex, it will go away when our society progresses enough. For e.g. Chinese would, till some 30-40 years ago, give examples of how their civilization was the greatest, it invented paper money, gunpowder etc. etc. Now they don't care because they know that they have moved so far ahead that they don't care what happened in past (for the most part). A civilization like us which has for almost a millennia had foreign rule/subjugation would need some time to recover.

>These fools were relegated mostly to tasks that did not need  intellectual acumen. They did their servile jobs and nurtured the pride  that Ganesha had the first plastic surgery. They did their thankless  duties and passed on their ignorance to their children. But someday,  these fools had to come to prominence and they did. They started winning  elections.

Oh come on! What is life without some mythology? I used to be fascinated about my late grandfather(paternal grandfathers elder brother) telling me stories about *Shesh Naag* balancing earth on his head. I knew this wasn't true, but it was really interesting to hear his beliefs. And he would often say - **Mano to bhagwan, nahi to patthar** \- what more rationality could you ask from an older generation of your family?

>Why would another judge declare that Brahmins are born twice?

I am out of loop, but  I don't understand what is wrong in calling Brahmins twice-born? Brahmins are considered - **dvij** (*dvi janmana iti* \- don't remember which *samas* it is) - i.e. taking birth twice, once when they are born and once when they have their **janev** ceremony (not a Brahmin so don't know what its called). This is similar to how birds are called **dvij**, they are born once in eggs and are born again when they hatch.

Dude!! Why? **The wizard's elixir.**

Every Religion, Culture or Nation have their myths, stories, and legends. While most of them are false some of them do hold their foundations in the truth. They are just told through the form of oral tradition, and like everything that travels through oral communication tends to change a little bit in every retelling, so it is very mature of you to call out their lack of education for such a small matter, while you, me and everyone are sitting here because of these uneducated people's hard-work without the facilities being this good in that time and age. And still, there are many things from these stories or ""idiot's blabbering"" as you call them, that are proven to be correct by science.

It is known that egotism is the bane of a man. Yet so many people never let it go, and hold on to the poison that keeps corrupting them and never let them see anything other than what they want to see and believe. You claim that our parents, grandparents uncle and aunts have shoved us towards ignorance and false pride, but that couldn't be more wrong, I speak for myself and many many people I have known throughout my life that my and their parents have done everything to make sure we pursue education and enlightenment. Uneducated they may be but they have given all their life to make us capable of our own judgment and every time they told us stories like you mentioned they also told us to research our-self if we want to believe it or not. And your biggest mistake is in thinking that we (who believe them) are stupid and mind-washed, but let me tell you most of the people you call bhakts and idiots and other things without getting to know them are well educated and believe in things because we are educated. You and other propaganda spreaders will know that if they actually knew who they were spreading the propaganda about, but you just amuse we are illiterate and idiots and most Indians are pompous fools, lol, very educated of you to assume what most bhakts are, But by all means keep doing that and it is our gain. In ego, a man thinks he is right and everyone else is wrong and that is where he/she is most wrong at.

As I said maybe stories change, but even then there is no proof that you can show that the stories are wrong, other than calling everyone idiot. While on the other hand there are proofs supporting the stories if not directly proving them right. E.g.- maybe Ganesha has had a plastic surgery (by the way i have never seen someone say this to me) or maybe he hadn't, but there is proof that ancient India was very capable of doing it, read about Sushruta. It is a proven fact that he could do many complex surgeries including that. Also, it was way before even the terms for them were coined. Ancient India was very much advanced in technology, metallurgy, and medicine. Yoga, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Damascus steel, Sushruta and many other things and people being examples. And if something hasn't yet been proven right, does not mean it is wrong.

Ah yes, the great argument that government has illiterates. Have you heard about George Washington, Abraham.L, Srinivas Ramanujan, Henry Ford, Frederick Douglass and many more, they were are illiterates in their fields, yet no one has does enough for humanity, science, mathematics, people and countries than them, whoever came up with the idea that educated people can only do great things does not know about what he is talking. Yes, education helps but a great man, a great leader is someone who does better with what they have given and does not complain about the things like, I was not educated enough, or education was bot available at my time. And who said educated people only do good, Osman-Bin-laden was a Civil engineer, Trump is graduate in Finance, Kim Jong-un studied in Switzerland before pursuing militarily university, they sure have set standards high.

Yes everything we say is vomiting and yet you are a man of class and every time you speak jewels rain down. Lol, just because Sanskrit is the best-placed language to be great for coding doesn't mean we have anything to do with it, and why are you butt-hurt even if we did try to research that, research is always being done on number of things, most of which are meaningless just to find something that is not, it is called research for a reason, but you are clearly hurt by that, why? you clearly have something against it, is it that you are a Pakistani agenda spreader with your fake bought account? And who are you to hold anyone responsible? what have you done with your esteem educated self? Oh right, you called most of us pompous idiots and duffers, so yeah that was a good use of education, I wonder why any politician didn't think of that, clearly they need to study more.

You call Nazis ignorant and idiots seriously, they were bad people, but ignorant and idiots they were not, they are famous for their mindset to improve technology and Science. They were the creators of some unmatched technology of that time. They worked and researched all the time to improve their technology and they did it, it took most of the world and countless good lives to pin them down. Just because they drew their inspirations from the past does not negate what they were good at. But you just have to draw a line to match Current India to Nazi Germany, just to further your propaganda, so you do not care about doing even a bit research or checking if what you are saying is true in the least. If Nazi Germany were to be good people then today they would be most educated and technologically advanced people of our time, but you only care about drawing false parallels.

Those people who believe in something just because someone has said some things by sugarcoating a few words are like everyone who is believing your propaganda without actually thinking of what you are really talking about. When wrongdoers and people who like to just spread false information think that their stupid stuff is not working anymore, they try to call others stupid, duffers, idiots, etc but that won't fool anyone who has a mind of their own.

In this post of yours, you have called most of us, stupid, idiot, duffers, and whatnot while never writing anything worth a chimp's intelligence, if this is what educated people are like, I am glad most of my country is illiterate as you claim and idiots.

&#x200B;

So, stop putting so must shit in that broth of yours or someone will find out that you are literally cooking some shit. What rubbish is this? Indians regularly focus on education - it’s pretty much a core tenet of Indian culture across all states and locations.

Most of this stuff in this thread is toxic- the kind of stuff that leads one to believe that being governed by a few elite is better than the will of the many. I voted for BJP in last two elections but my parents have never mentioned such stupid stuff, they always voted for congress prior to these elections and this time they didn't vote at all. Not everyone voting for bjp has the same background. I have congress rule from up close and know how corrupt they are. I don't give a fuck about Nazi comparisons or any other fear mongering and so does the majority of India.",Food,2019-08-20 18:44:21
McDonald's faces boycott threats in India for serving halal meat,228,cvwmg5,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/mcdonald-faces-boycott-threats-india-serving-halal-meat-190826083241873.html,223,,Futurist110," Religion is cancer and religious fanatics are cancer cells Can someone explain to me why people are up in arms about eating halal meat? I don't agree with it but I understand why people don't want to eat at beef/pork. Are people really that offended that their meat was blessed by a muslim cleric? It's not like it's going to taint the meat, is it? Aren't those throwing a fit supposed to be vegetarians in the first place? They have option to not go for meal to McDonald’s. As a vegetarian I will never understand the ibsession with the type of meat. You can very well go to McDonalds and have McVeggie with Cheese. Why boycott? Are these people even the main demographic for McD? Nothing's going to happen. I hope McD stands up to these internet trolls. Personally I don't like the halal practice, because it seems very painful to the animal. The jhatka method seems faster and cleaner. If we must kill animals, IMO its best to make it quick and as painless as possible.

However I have heard that halal just looks painful but its actually not, so idk. [removed] Halal vs Jhatka is just manufactured controversy 

Jhatka is horrible too. The animal is completely conscious when the head is cut off - god knows what happens. 

Stunning before removing the blood seems to be much more humane. The same bigots were supporting iskcon not adding garlic and onions in midday meals

>The call for more donation to the organisation was given by author Anand Ranganathan.

That guy is the founder of swarajya mag. They will defend not adding garlic and onions in government mid day meals paid by taxpayers. But they will call for boycott of private company like Mcdonald.

I wonder what these guys would do if people protested for beef in government mid day meals I thought the biggest selling point for the ""indic"" faiths was that they were not scriptural. How is this jhatka nonsense different from the halal nonsense?

And it's hilarious to see shuddh shakahari brahmins living in California crying about denial of livelihood to dalits, while I have yet to see any dalit crying about halal. 

Duplicity, thy name is hindutva! Love it when pure veg fash care so much about meat just to hate Muslims Aaiye, ye hai humara Naya India Halal meat is not good. Burgers should be vegetarian and washed in Gaumutra. This will keep the Hindus Hindu and convert the rest of the Mlecchas (dirty people) to Hinduism. I'm safe, I don't eat meat 😀 Guruji sahi bole the ""kya hai Iss duniya me bachane layak"" Yeh jitne bhi logic wale log hain sabko Bahar nikalo.

Tamas failao ganes. Aag lagao Man i just want to know why mc donalds stopped serving chicken mcgrill and chicken masala mcgrill. notice how, for all the claims of rationality and areligious enlightenment by self proclaimed rationalists and purveyors of all things enlightened, none of them questions the practice of halal to begin with? amazing it is. I will be frank. I'm opposed to halal for two reasons.

\#1. it is a barbaric practice.

\#2. it is imposition of ungrounded/irrelevant religious norm.

Also too:

does mcdonald's india serve bacon? if not why not?

why so much reverence to only one sectarian community? They should offer both cuts if people prefer one or the other. I really hope that people weren't getting sick and dying from eating this that would be horrible. I'm a Muslim and let me tell you the concept behind the Halal and why we prefer it.

First of all, there is no cleric involved at the time of slaughter. Halal is just the way to prepare meat. Most of the disease lies in blood and blood is also the main reason behind the rotten meat.

No need religion to understand that you should boycott Mc Donald and instead support your local food provider. How does Al-jazeera know about this and we living in India have no information on it. Macdonalds and Kfc in India sucks anyways. And not because they don't serve beef. I have eaten macdonalds in over 12 countries and i rank India as the worst when it comes to taste and the sauce.

Should you clean up after yourself in fast food restaurants?,76,clwug1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/clwug1/should_you_clean_up_after_yourself_in_fast_food/,36,"Pardon the stupid question, but I'm foreign and just had a KFC worker go ballistic because I took my own tray to the dustbin. I understand that most fast food outlets here employ workers to clear tables, but I feel like an asshole when I leave trash on a table when the dustbin is two meters away. 

I've actually spent a lot of time here in India and still have no idea WTF do in fast food places. Do workers get in trouble when customers take care of their own trash or something? It's hard to overcome my own cultural programming (TBQH I think it's stupid that adults need someone to open the door for them and clear a plastic tray in fast food joints, but I suppose it's good that these people have the work?), but I don't want some dude to lose his job because of it.",LostAndDesserted," 1. Most eateries/restaurants dont expect customers to clean up

2. You are a foreigner. If you start cleaning then they will be left red faced and ashamed that a foreign guest has to clean up himself rather than them serving you  Restaurants in India don't expect guests to clean up after them so the staff will always be helpful. As a personal choice, I prefer using the dustbin wherever available. I went to Subway and there was no one to pick the leftover tray with food wrapper. So, I did it myself and no one stopped me. I used to throw my pizza container boxes to the dustbin in Pizza Hut etc. in South India. Nobody ever even looked.

But in one of the North Indian cities, when I did the same, the entire joint looked at me, murmured stuff, stared at me for the next two-three minutes I was there. So never did it there again. Not ever in the North.

This is about fast food joints.

I never think of cleaning after me in traditional restaurants. no they will not lose their job btw hello nice person! Our great country still runs on Manusmriti ideoloy
Cleaning trash is considered as a demeaning job even if its yours . I remember 10 years back we had no such privileges at McDonald's. Everyone had to put their own thrash in the bin. May be with the increased footfall, they started this. If they’re disposable items, I ask one of them where do I dispose this off. Most of the times, they appreciate the gesture but prefer to do it themselves because of their bosses. 

If washable dishes, it’s better to just leave it on the table. Yeah we always pick our stuff up and leave them in the trash can. No two ways about it. I usually do that in food courts of malls I personally clean up the table so all he has to do is pick up & drop my trash in a dustbin. Which KFC was this? Let this be a lesson for Yuppie Indians who learn *Americanese* by watching sitcoms and going to KFCs:  Remember to pick-up and clean up after yourself at fast food restaurants when you actually get to NYC, London or Toronto. May be the restaurant had a rule about some specific food items to be thrown in specific dustbins and the management will give him a mouthful if done wrong? Well, I totally agree with you, I like to clean up after myself in fast food chains and have got used to weird looks not only from the workers, also from the other tables. I mean, what's their problem to pick up after themselves! It's not like you're being told to clean up the whole city! Kudos to you, but the fact that you're a foreigner, especially if you're white, it'll make it much worse, since the worker's 'atithi devobhava' instinct will be inevitably stimulated. So, best thing you can do is either get used to the odd looks like I have, or yeah, let them pick up after you I have cleaned up after as well, in fast food places, and have never been told anything. Have also been thanked a few times doing so, by the staff. 

Nothing wrong in doing the right thing. Lots of people here man. They won't have jobs if everyone started cleaning up after themselves or had parking manners. It is a good thing for India.

Places like subway you can clean up after yourself. They usually don't have doing this all the time. Meh dumbass shithole country lost in its own anus",Food,2019-08-04 22:23:50

An Indian menu in Japan,965,cpo2mr,https://i.redd.it/yy2kbtuz85g31.jpg,150,,Rockstar762," Was that naan made with a bike saddle? Oh them Japanese and their phallic naans All suffixed with Curry Hahaha love the spiciness index but having eaten there the top of that scale is probably a low 4/10 here. 850 Yen (appx Rs. 600) for a ""thali"" containing 2 curries, rice, one naan, salad and a lassi.

Honestly i thought food in Japan was a lot more costlier than that. Apparently they have the highest prices for fruits in the world. Lived there for an year or so. There are Indian curry chains probably every block or so(in Tokyo only) , owing to the lower costs of running them.

A lot of them don't have actual Indian chefs and run by people from Indian sub continent but not from India. Look how they massacred my naan! That dick shaped naan though :D Mutton curry looking like a bowl of tomato soup! I wonder if it tastes the same or more like anime Blueberry Lassi !! Juicy chicken number one ♪ Did we just catch that naan warping into hyperspace at light speed? *cries in butter paneer masala* >Same drink is free for an hour

That's a sweet deal... All you can have Mango lassis for an hour! This Japanese guy posts about Indian food in Japan all the time. He also sells Indian cookware. https://twitter.com/AsiaHunter_com As a foreigner, this is way more authentic than a lot of the ""continental"" food/menus I've seen in India. Read an article last year - Indian Curry was made immensely popular in Japan by the revolutionary Rash Behari Bose, who settled there later in life. He was known as The Bose Of Nakamuraya there! Dildo Naan. Must be quite a favorite with Japanese ladies. Anyone please make the world understand that INDIAN FOOD IS *NOT* ALL ABOUT **CURRY**

I wonder how much are the price for those ? At least they don't have only a single curry Pricing not bad, yes? I love going to Tokyo, last there 2 weeks ago. I was surprised at the number of Indian restaurants there. Decent food though, and the owners of some of the places I went to speak excellent Japanese as well. Keep Calm and curry on. I've heard of Palak paneer, palak chicken, methi mattar malai but where did cheese sag curry come from? golden necklace on every other dish How is the cost of this food as compared to other food items in Japan? Is it too expensive ? Oh boy CANT wait to taste curry curry Okay boiz, let's start the series of ""I saw your Japanese Indian menu, I raise my <enter country name> indian menu"" posts. Egg kheema curry curry Curry was brought to Japan over a hundred years ago by the true masters of curry, i.e. British sailors. With that kind of pedigree, you can draw your own conclusions on the quality of Japanese curry. Naansense! The Gastropod podcast had a great episode on [Curry and how it migrated to the world](https://gastropod.com/the-curry-chronicles/), especially Japan. The thing about Japanese Indian food is that it bears almost no relation to Indian food except very tangentially. The route curry took to reach Japan went something like this:

Indian currys (which BTW were a Mughal import) --> modified by the British colonists to suit their palettes --> became popular among the Americans (who were also a British colony) --> An independent USA sent [Commodore Matthew Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_C._Perry) to open up Japan for trade --> The Japanese emperor became fond of the curry the Americans brought with them and because everyone wanted to imitate the Emperor, curry became popular in Japan. It was still popular only with the upper classes until the Japanese Navy made curry a mandatory food on its ships (it was the easiest way to make a meal containing most of the necessary vitamins). After this [Japanese curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_curry) became very popular, now being served in schools and cafeterias as a staple part of their cuisine. That's cheap The damn naan is so disgusting. I hate it. Its like an INCH thick. 

Even the “curry” they sell is so bland. Even if you go 10/10 on the spicy scale its STILL SWEET. So? Us Indians and our phallic naans Above 500₹ 🧐

"#BoycottMcDonalds trends online after they say they serve halal meat. So food has religion, says Internet",12,cuauhw,https://www.indiatoday.in/trending-news/story/boycott-mcdonalds-trends-halal-food-religion-zomato-1590737-2019-08-23,20,,Murabajaan," Long ago, I had imagined of a time when McD in India would serve pork and beef alongside its offerings. Looking at the current trends, I don’t think it’ll happen in my life. It’s one of the reasons I also shifted to local burger joints that do serve pork, beef, as well as halal chicken. 

Serving halal chicken is just convenience. In many parts of India, the concept of jhatka is absolutely unknown. I’ve not come across a single restaurant that serves jhatka meat or an individual demanding jhatka meat through these many years of eating out, which is why most places don’t serve jhatka meat. Given the vitiated climate these days, it’s only recently that even the concept came to be known. But even then, a restaurant has the right to serve whatever it wants to serve. 

I personally love bacon and beef patties. I don’t call for the boycott of restaurants that don’t serve them because they don’t serve my dietary preferences, nor do I barge into a vegetarian restaurant and demand that I should be served meat and why they’re imposing vegetarianism on me. You see, you’ve a choice to eat there — if you don’t want to eat there, don’t. By calling for boycotts and other coercive measures, you’re trying to browbeat a company. That doesn’t bode well for investor’s sentiment. Let us say they boycott McD, let’s say McD closes down. Do you not realise the kind of direct and indirect impact that can have on the economy? Which company or person would want to start a business in this climate, where you’re damned if you do, and damned if you don’t? This is not just with McD. We’ve seen this happen with Zomato, Ubereats, Snapdeal, Amazon and even IRCTC. We have become absolutely stupid, to be honest. I don't get the stupidity of trending this. Every food outlet will try to over Halal as other meat aren't accepted by a religion that is largest or second largest in the world. That is a huge market, why would McDonalds give up this market.",Food,2019-08-23 16:09:12
How different is our street Chinese food from authentic Chinese food?,22,csci5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/csci5u/how_different_is_our_street_chinese_food_from/,26,You know those small Chinese tapri stalls with a chef from the north east? How different is that compared to actual Chinese food from China?,mylackey," Had been to Hong Kong few months ago. Had fee dishes there. We make it spicy and also use way too much garlic predominantly in Indo Chinese. I've had Chinese food in authentic Chinese restaurants here in Mumbai and also from Indian- Chinese restaurants and I prefer the Indian twist. I find authentic Chinese a bit  bland for my taste. Even the spicy Sichuan ones have a numbing spice to them which I don't think will satisfy the Indian palate.

There are variations of Chinese food served abroad since Chinese immigrants there have had to tinker with the recipes to suit the locals taste . I've had American- Chinese cuisine when I was in the States and found it sweeter and more fatty/greasy compared to here.

Moral: **Indian Chinese cuisine FTW** Very different.

Check Trevor James on Youtube (The Food Ranger), He has covered chinese cuisine extensively. Its just indo-chinese. Real chinese food is not like that. Day and night. China like India has different regions with thier own cuisine. The chinese street food we eat resembles food from sichuan  regionof china. To give an example, cantonese food is not at all spicy and actually bland n cold All you need to do is watch a few travel shows on China and you can tell the differences yourself. Their cuisine is very diverse. Very very different. Was in Singapore a couple of months ago.  

Its mostly soupy but bland and its definitely an acquired taste. Chinese food is mostly pork and sea food in terms of meat. It is Indo-Chinese. Some of the cooking styles are similar. However, punjabi masalas have mutated with Chinese and we now have the Indo-Chinese cuisine. The street food is basically totally unrecognisable to Chinese people. If you go to local Chinese restaurants, a few basic staples and ingredients have been totally modified with Indian flavours and techniques. Even if you go to expensive Chinese restaurants which claim to serve authentic food, it has been modified to serve our tastes, but the dishes atleast are a familiar.  

Also, north east and nepali cuisine is a very distinct cuisine, which is separate from Chinese cuisine. It's not the same thing. It's sort of like generalising and calling Pakistani food and Andhra food the same thing (which a lot of Europeans and Americans probably might do). My bad by bland i meant less spicy I doubt if you could find authentic Chinese cuisine in India. What  you eat in India is ""Indian Chinese""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Chinese_cuisine

From what I have talked with Chinese people, the cuisine is very region specific and not spicy as you would expect. I have been to couple of Chinese restaurants in Canada, and  I came back hungry because a) Very few vegetarian options 2) Even with vegetarian options, most of them involve noodles and steamed vegetables. I believe even vegetarian options might be more suited for general Canadian population including Indians.

Also, I would thoroughly avoid their dessert. What I have seen is they tend to be rice based and gelatinous - not a fan of that texture.

TL;DR - what you normally see in India is not authentic Chinese food. Very different.
Been to Schenzen , and had both restaurant food and street food there. The 'Chinese' food available in India is very different . note that some dishes from Arunanchal, Nagaland, etc are much closer to food you actually get in China. A lot of the authentic Chinese food dishes are so good you'll puke (source: my Dad when he calls me when he goes to China) No chinese have ever heard of Manchurian. Schezwan is not a thing, Sichuan, however, is a thing and is way spicier than anything in India, but it is a diff kind of spicy, a sort of numbing spice ( Sichuan chilli pepper) - it is amazing. 

China, like India, has a  variety of cuisines - cantonese, shanghainese, hainan, sichuan, xinjian and so on. 

You fried rice in local places that taste a lot like Indian chinese, though. They have almost bo breads. There is a crepe like thing, usually with peking duck, which is the closest they have to a bread.",Food,2019-08-19 13:07:56

What they get in school is a vile concoction of hero-worshipping, patriotism, nationalism, religion, obedience and a rat race to score more marks.

We are just North Korea with internet Guess what we will be writing for self-appraisal next year..  The lowlife should spare the children atleast. Breaks my heart.

Where else have we seen a populist right wing guy force his ideology on the young and turn them into foot soldiers for his regime? 🤔 Their propaganda has long been running through schools like ""Saraswati Shishu Mandir"" and many more, accross all over India churning out ""Bhakts"".
Now they have just expanded to other Private and Govt Schools too.
Just one year of schooling in these is enough to do wonders for them in upcomming days. We are just doomed. I'm for abrogation of 370 & 35A, BUT *I must protest for forcing school children into this.* Even young adults in their 20s won't be able to comprehend the complexities and politics behind this Kashmir problem. The principal of that should be booked by the law. How can any org force anyone on what to think, and how to think? That's pathetic job from that school. sounds like desi version of Hitler's youth to me! Children at \*\*\*\*A\*\*\*\* school were asked to write a letter to PM.

no where does it state it is mandated by the PM, heck, let even the principal of the school. It may have been a *bhakt* teacher forcing their students.

But lets go ahead with the headline and Modi bashing. instead of trying to make it seem Modi is using propaganda in favor of 370 abrogation, this is propaganda by independent to malign on Modi's image. Of all the things they could malign his image, this is how they chose to do it? idiots. are you guys really this crazy? every country has national anthem, pledges and etc in school.. ofc its an indoctrination.. thats the whole concept behind nation state.. people here complaining that its like hitler and mussolini have zero perspective.. or dont know that we literally are like any other country..

I am sorry, but I laughed out loud reading this. OP, you're an idiot, and you don't know how to deal with issues. If the tracking did say the order was picked up and then there was no response, how the hell can you call it ""Delivery guy ran away with food?"" I'm calling you an idiot because you keep repeating that exact phrase in this thread as if you saw him running away with your food. It could have been an issue with the restaurant where they they couldn't fulfill your order hence fake processed it until the tracking starts. Someone else near your house could have taken it from the delivery guy because free food. Whatever, learn how to state your problem correctly. Mention only the things that you know for sure.

Not:

> My order was picked up and the delivery guy ran away with it

> This is the truth

I'm sure you would have said something similar in the Zomato review, and that is why your review was removed. Ordered Dry Manchurian from Zomato. Received fried onions. Called the restaurant & he said ""Sir, manchurian khatam ho gaya tha!"" Messaged Zomato Support. Initially said no for refund. After 15 minutes of my asking to call me or transfer to somebody senior, gave me a refund. Actually this might have gotten Zomato in legal trouble(even though they would easily win, they don't even want to take chances of litigation). You claimed  (i believe you personally) that the restaurant committed a crime so that can have serious legal consequences. My restaurant consistently gets 4 or 5 star ratings on Zomato, and still our rating shows as 3.7 on the site. Super buggy, super rigged even for restaurants. Allegations are bad stuff on reputation based systems.

When it’s an information/social system it’s worse. Either it’s too easy to mass produce allegations and destroy competitors, or it’s too easy to generate reviews and game the system.

To stop this, people end up watching their review pages like hawks, and clean up anything they can, in any way they can. There was no delivery guy. The restaurant made an empty claim and you hallucinated that there was a delivery guy. What I understand is you didn't see the delivery guy ran off but he did mark the delivery as fulfilled. You should be writing the events as you saw in app. Not infer that the agent ran away. It becomes a bold allegation and hence removed. 

The restaurant is certainly at fault for the failure, maybe their modus operandi. But your allegations are definitely unsubstantiated. Please write to us the review, maybe censor any privacy-related names of the restaurant and your locality.

Also, the review on Zomato seems as if it was removed by Zomato, not the Restaurant. Try sending the review again. Shukr manao biwi ke saath nahi bhaaga How do you know it an employee of the restaurant?.

Can you actually prove that someone from the restaurant stole your food?.

Unless and until you have solid proof, it is an allegation. 

Zomato is right is removing your allegation. 

You can't go around throwing claims you cant prove on their website. 

The business can sue Zomato for causing a ""loss of reputation"". Rewrite review. Take screenshot of that and this and post it on twitter tagging zomato. Zomato has been manipulating reviews, ratings and listings since a while now. 

Quite a few top reviewers and regular members are paid / given perks to shape a review a particular way. 

Zomato hike up ur ranking and rating if u buy a paid package

Zomato downs rating of restaurants that are popular with people and generate organic orders but do not comply with zomato 'policies' or 'promotion packages'

A friend has a micro brewery , the beer and the food is below average, a few years back he bought one such promotion package from zomato and all those positive reviews really drove up the sales.

The beer and food still sucks, but the place does business coz herd mentality zindiabad ;) What did u write again?

We always talk about unemployment, now when there are opportunities they tend to toss it off with irrational excuses Divided by religion, united by chutiyaap Religion will be the single major cause of the destruction of the country. If your religion is making it difficult to work for Zomato, quit your religion or quit your job.

No one is asking the drivers to eat beef/pork.

What next, the zomato drivers will refuse to deliver to people based on caste too ? Why are they going on strike? The job requires them to deliver all types of food. If zomato only delivers veg then the people will go to other's for ordering food.  They will have to shut down in places like these. These delivery boys should just quit their job. And let the people that have no problem with this deliver food. But religion does not say anything about delivering food, does it? Then fire the idiots legally. There's no shortage of unemployed people in India, is there?

> Two of their demands are that the Zomato **should revise the pay order** and the company also must stop playing with the religious sentiment of their employees. 

Of course this issue isn't highlighted. From Kolkata

*Zomato delivery boys will go on a strike from Monday protesting that the food being delivered by them is hurting their religious sentiments.*

*Delivery boys have refused to deliver beef or pork during the festive celebrations of Bakrid or Eid al-Adha to be celebrated this week on Monday*. My God, this is so stupid. When my Pakistani best friend and I worked a part time job in a fast food restaurant, I had to cook beef and he had to cook pork. He didn't eat the pork and I didn't eat the beef. Do the Zomato drivers eat some of the food they deliver and are now upset that they can't do so always? wtf?

They're actually making it *acceptable* to ask the religion of the delivery boy.  If I order beef, I want to make sure the delivery boy isn't Hindu.  If its pork, I must check that the person is not muslim.

This country is travelling in reverse gear. Foreign me Jake  log sab kar lete hai. Sala apne country me hi yeh chutiyapa chalta hai. Politicians trying to get paid. Oldest trick in the book. People were expecting 1984 but got 1857 instead. So proud! *Christian boys rubbing their hands* The same employees who Zomato tried to protect from bigotry. Delivery is unskilled labour. The only entry barrier is a bike, which can easily be funded these days. Zomato can easily replace these guys with new delivery boys. This is unlike a strike in the industries where skilled labour is employed. Oh for fucks sake... The level of entitlement nowadays blows my mind.

You are delivering a package not sharing the meal. If your religious beliefs are preventing you from handling other people's food then you are in the wrong business. Open a Pujan Bhandar or something.

I seriously hope Zomato doesn't negotiates with these morons. These Zomato riders have to deliver food, not eat it unless they decide to take a sneak ~~peek~~ bite. 

Anyway, if you don't like the job, then quit and find a job that you're comfortable with. Zomato has nothing to lose here. Instead, they could just fire them and a hundred new applicants will be ready with their resumes. Zomato isn't a government agency that will just cave-in to any ridiculous demand these riders make. The Zomato Mutiny of 2019... Wait, someone said beef ? Kidar milta hai? Most probably thursday or friday night a hindu rider delivered my beef bhuna in kolkata. Me and my friend even joked about it because of the controversy that happened earlier.I hope my order didn't trigger this. 
(I am a hindu brahmin). Apparently, this is a fake protest. I'm not sure about this guy's veracity, but he's claiming that [beef and pork are not even available for delivery in Howrah on Zomato](https://twitter.com/peeleraja/status/1160568167271297024). Read the entire thread. Waiting for my beef burger to get delivered by Swiggy as I type this :D 1857 all over again. How to do business in India ? I am quitting zomato because i want them to make jain food only. 💪 How would the delivery boys know what they are carrying? Simply don't work at places where such things are cooked rather than creating such drama.

Customers are free to eat any food of their own choice. Delivery boys hold packed food only. What's the hue and cry all about? Next veg drivers should protest against non veg and vice versa
/s What next? Delivery guy rebellion? 

If your religious practices comes in way of your work, you either leave the job or the faith. No business is bigger than religion business. What is becoming of this country! Our country is a joke. Big joke. No matter how nationalistic or patriotic or whatever you are, it doesn't hide the fact that our country is filled with completely stupid people. Beef? Kinda makes sense by their twisted perspective. Pork? Wat? Which politician is involved in this? Must be a cash grab time. The don't fucking work for a job which will require you to deliver stuff. Fuck off then. Secularism on platter. It has all the hallmarks of a planted controversy by BJP. Bengal jeetne ke liye kuch bhi karenge. True solidarity. This is what Indians have done in 1857 against the Britishers. Masterstroke behind this? Chutiye Laat maar ke aise delivery boys ko bahar nikalo. This is so upsetting. Now well educated youth is also getting into such religious biases. When such good start ups are giving employment to hundreds. Religion, which is supposed to unite people has now become a tool to spread hatrate and divide. It is just delivering. No one is forcing them to eat it, wtf lol Religion divides, Zomato unites. isn't this way too similar to that triggers of 1857 revolt ? Quit if you dont like your job kya chutiye log hai bc New criteria for making friends. Hindus who eat beef and Muslims who eat pork and drink. App Idea: Satvik Bhojan Delivery Just like 1857! This is hilarious man either do your fucking job or go and sit in front of Mosque or Temple. > The employees have, allegedly, informed their higher authorities but there is no response from them as of now. 

So god has not responded. That's a surprise. Something seriously wrong with India !  RED ALERT ! Modern day Mangal Pandeys. Calm yourself guys - it's only happening in West Bengal , given the politicisation and tendency to unionise - it's obvious Sepoy mutiny 1857 It is a millennial version of sepoy mutiny!! Yes, when I can't even get something to eat delivered to my house without any controversy just because some delivery men don't like it. Love India Inventing new ways to destroy job creation. Perfect. Let the hindus not deliver beef and Muslims not deliver pork.Rest they can deliver anyway. it's not such a huge issue

I think the money here is a bigger issue This is the 1857 Enfield Rifle all over again. simple fix would be to make sure that the drivers have no way of knowing what they are delivering

unless they open the food which would mean that they get instantly fired for fucking with someone else's food More divide and rule. Zomato: barely saves itself from a religious controversy

Religion: Parry this you fucking casual Zomato delivery boy ""kabhi kabhi lagta hai apun hi bhagwan hai "" Rampant stupidity plagues this country. I wonder how will zomato turn this into good PR. They had it easy last time coming up with ""Food has no religion"".

For the record I will eat both pork and beef delivered by any community. Bas JD mangta hai",Food,2019-08-11 16:55:43

Good on Zomato for standing up to hatred. What if the cook was a Muslim? time to rate Zoomcar as 1 star People have started to give 1 star rating in Playstore for Zomato App.

LMAFO 😂😂 Okay, [Here](https://ibb.co/s5Zs0Ht) is an old tweet by our Panditji who don't want Muslim guy to deliver him food, Five years back!

BTW, This guy is followed by Office of Piyush Goyal..and Die hard Modi bhakt with MBA degree. Let that sink in... Why is this post getting heavily downvoted?

How can people in their right minds support this bigotry?!? Has Indians always been like this? I'm from South and see people from all the religions living in harmony.

Or did the mindset of people change in the last 10 years or so. अगर कोई मुस्लिम रास्ते में हिंदू के खाने में गौ मांस मिला देगा तो क्या उसकी जिम्मेदारी जोमैटो लेगी -one bhakt on twitter Did that guy really think that he would find support for his bigotry on Twitter? The handle name has references to modi and is followed by the verified handle of the ""office of Piyush Goel"". No surprise there.

People might try to ""enlightened centrism"" all the want, one side is definitely worse than the others and enables this sort of hatred. If this looks like bigotry then you should actually see the threads that's supporting it, from complaints about muslims asking for halal food to conspiracies about muslims trying to poison their food. Ugh. Someone should call HR at his company and tell them that he is refusing to do business with Muslim customers. [People reviews, the ](https://imgur.com/a/sH0amyZ)[tip of an iceberg](https://imgur.com/a/sH0amyZ) In any other country, people would think twice before doing something like this and boast about it on Social Media. Not in Modi's India. A generation of Indians are being radicalized right before our eyes. India is of our Indian Muslims too, and our Sikhs and our Christians.
 One religion - one country is a failed concept bhakts!! Well, the twitter handle checks out!! The boycott zomato tag is trending on twitter. I don't know about you guys, but it's a bit frightening to me. Mainly because the whole thing seems utterly batshit crazy to me. Even the 'month of shrawan' argument is stupid. Why would you order outside if that is your concern because how would you know who all were involved in preparing the actual food ? After I read the guys twitter handle name, I am not surprised about his complaint. The sad thing is, ""NaMo_SARKAAR"" guy really thought he was doing a great job & was sure that many other people will agree with him. Read the following in an article this is what the delivery executive said -

""Han hurt to hue hai. Ab kya bolenge sir, ab log jaisa bolenge..sahi hai is par kya kar sakte hai gareeb log hai... sahna padega sir (Yes I feel hurt. What can I say sir, whatever people say...its okay what I can do in it... we are poor, we have suffer),"" he said.

This is so sad. How can you make someone feel this way in the name of religion.as for people claiming why is Zomato serving halal food there is something called as ""food preference"" just like vegan or vegetarian you are not insulting or hurting someone by preferring a certain type of food.  Amazing response by Zomato though. Meanwhile, bhakts are having seizures trying to compare this blatant incident of bigotry to how Muslims demand 'halal food'.

To their rotten, dung-infected brains, Muslims asking for halal food is the exact *same* level of 'bigotry' as a Hindutva Nazi specifically demanding that a 'Muslim' *not* deliver his order.

How much more fucked up can a society be? Sangh should launch a new food delivery service where you can choose the cook and driver based on caste and religion. Give consumers the freedom of choice. How jobless should one have to be to take everything personally and dedicate time and effort to downvote a company. And also, twitter is full of psychos Whats with the sudden rise of this Hindu extremism? What the fuck happened? Or was it always going on and I just didn't know about it... He should be blacklisted by zomato & all other food delivery businesses. >Zomato’s response kills it.

Why is food allergies less prevelant in India?,44,cc7yq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cc7yq8/why_is_food_allergies_less_prevelant_in_india/,74,"Whenever I see America the food allergies are so much widespread. 
Peanuts are not allowed in school. All package good and restaurants must have allergy warnings while I have never known a Indian person having food allergies .Is it due to lack of awareness or something else?",devgrv," Our immune responses are different from theirs. Moreover, genetics is a great factor that helps us. 

If you introduce children early on (till about 5 years) to allergenic foods, their chances of developing allergy later is reduced.

I'm no expert, do correct me if I'm wrong. Bhai Yahaan jise jo milta hai woh kha lete hain There are way less autoimmune here as well. Read hygeine hypothesis or biome theory. Mostly cause of the conditions a baby is brought up in. 

Americans do spend a lot of time wiping surfaces with antibacterial wipes and stuff, making the child less immune.

Don't really need to explain our case Hum Gareeb desh hain. Yeh sab allergies are first-world issues! >Is it due to lack of awareness or something else?   

lack of awareness does not cause allergies.    

Indians breathe in dirty air, drink dirty water, eat roadside food that's made with unhygienic stuff with unclean hands, there's utter lack of sense of hygiene here. those plastic disposable gloves you see at restaurants: those are namesake. staff scratch their hair, and whatnot while wearing the same gloves. they are just to keep their hands clean. not to keep our food clean.  we do not have allergies coz we are used to these things. we do not get loose toos after eating street food coz our bodies are immune to those germs.   
have you seen friends / relatives that were eating all filthy roadside food here, and then stayed abroad for 18months and come back for a visit , eat idli sambar and get diarrhea ? coz their immune system has gone weak thanks to the sterile environment in Amrikka. Because Indians have been eating all kinds of potentially allergic food since time immemorial, and natural selection has done  what it does best. The thing that does not kill you only  makes you stronger. I'm allergic to shellfish. Indians are least fussy about this. The only thing you will get warnings about is egg and meat. Maybe because some allergies are hereditary. They are too damn clean. Children aren’t supposed to grow in a sanitized environment. I'm allergic to eggs😕 I remember reading a study where they proposed this theory that unsanitary conditions during childhood actually helps in preventing these allergies. They proved some link between gut bacteria and the allergies I think. Can't find it now. Indians have become mutant, immune to Farzi diseases like allergies. 30 percent Indians are lactose intolerant 

People don't know what they are allergic of Can't just be awareness. If you're not aware of your peanut allergy you become aware in a hurry. Maybe children not raised in a clinically clean environment get less allergies? I have a notion, but because large agricultural companies often pay for the ""science"" to verify the safety of their products and work hard to silence those who disagree, this is difficult to prove. However, I'm of the belief that the increasing pesticides and GMOs adversely affect gut health tied to allergy issues. The most common allergens are tied to industries with the most pesticides: corn, wheat, soy, and peanuts, to name a few. Food allergies were not that widespread in America, and it's only been on the uptick coincidentally around the same time as the higher prevalence of GMOs and heavy pesticides. Agriculture was nowhere near consolidated in the hands of a few as it is today. 

&#x200B;

It kinda makes sense because GMO foods and pesticides are both designed with the goal of rupturing an insect's stomach. Given the genetic similarities between humans and even the lowly fruitfly, I don't know how we can all be surprised that humans experience food allergies, IBS, leaky gut, and a number of other problems from eating the same foods designed to kill insects. Americans eat allot of processed foods. Also there is an over reliance on drugs... allergy is reaction of body that is fighting something it deems risky for your immune system.

Indians generally eat everything from a very early age. so our body gets used to all kind of stuff and also the hygiene angle comes in. Our immune gets used to some germs. We are immune but our next generation might face it. Thanks to our new fad diet and water. There is a theory that when peanut allergies started showing up in america the doctors advised pregnant women to stop eating all kinds of nuts immediately.

Years later it was observed that nut allergies suddenly grew disproportionatly. 

Also a large number of allergy cases can be minimised and eradicated with continuous controlled exposure.

As for Indians.... You can't really actively avoid anything coz everything is adulterated and contaminated.",Food,2019-07-12 16:00:38

A real ""Kaidi Kitchen"" For those who are concerned with profiteering.

The money goes back to the upkeep and expansion of the kitchen, ingredients, and wages to the prisoners. The wages are quite low around 100 Rs per day IIRC and for good reason. They have been doing it for more than a decade I think. In Trivandrum at first, they used to send vans to places around the city where the policemen would sell food packets. Usual spots would be around Government hospitals. They expanded the program to start vegetable farms and poultry farms within the jail. They also started a restaurant next to the prison, which is very popular. This is just an extension of services since Swiggy and Ubereats have expanded rapidly in Kerala. Huh. The more you know.

I apologize for the way I have written as English is not my first language its actually one of the few times I've written in English that to such a long topic hope you understand !

Last edit - I do not run a burger place :p I own a south Indian chain but the example of a burgers was a rough example to make you guys understand !",Bluebaleno," Did zomato ask you before putting discount on your food? > The 40 percent discount of Zomato is running will cost. Me another 50-70 rupees I would end up selling the burger for 130 and then there is 5 percent gst too this unethical behavior is killing restaurants And local businesses

Can you explain why restaurants are bearing the discount that Zomato is giving, when Zomato is supposed to bear the discount provided by them? Update
 Some of you have some common questions which I will answer

As for source simply call Zomato ask them you want to sign with them what's the contract they offer it. Will not be below 25% 

People saying without them I would not have orders that far its true but I before they started their own delivery (Zomato) my boys would go 7-8 kilometers for even a order worth 160  Zomato use to be a website to look for restaurants you could not order my boys since. Then have been going for 7-8. Kilometers 

Lastly to end this topic Zomato is soon making a place where you would have to buy your raw. Materials from them only which is known as hyperpure which. Will become mandatory to buy from according to my account manager if we want to work with them even Swiggy is buying. Spaces taking restaurants. Under that space and selling the restaurants item under Swiggys name  as someone who's been  in the industry for 12. Years you can choose to believe me or the company but if it continues the way it is many for your favorite places will shutdown thanks guys for hearing me out its been a tough year for restaurants ! > Tldr- Zomato Swiggy uber cheat the restaurants and you as the customer share this !

Cheating is strong word. They aren't cheating anyone but a lot of their business practice is outright predatory. 

Don't restuarant owners have unions? If not, you guys should unionize and negotiate better deals with these companies. In Zomato and Swiggy's war for customerbase, small businesses suffer. It's the same thing with Uber taxis; they scam the taxi drivers by charging large commissions off an already low taxi fare. Also restaurant owners send half filled boxes when people apply such discounts to make up the loss, so you both are riding the same boat. 

I'hv noticed this numerous times in different cities, try vising the restaurant and getting parcel in person, you'll notice they'll use smaller sized packages while sending food via zomato. OP, let me tell you how to solve this problem but you'll have to become a little tech savvy for that! 

In Pune, there is a restaurant called ""Behrouz Biryani"" who were facing similar problem as yours, let me tell you how they solved it. I used to order biryani from there through Zomato. When I repeatedly ordered biryani about 4-5 times, they texted me a special offer: If I purchased through **their** app in the Play Store (instead of Zomato), they'll give me an additional whopping 20% discount compared to the present price!

I figured out they must be facing the same issue as yours. Zomato, the middle man must be eating all their profits through discounts and delivery charges but if they (Behrouz Biryani) had their own app in the Play Store, people will order directly from there and they can be offered a much better price now. They'll have to arrange logistics but it should be trivial if you are running an established restaurant for a long time.

Try that OP, app development is not that difficult these days. Catch a trustworthy techie and either he'll code it himself for you, or he'll know a freelancer friend who'll do it. The future belongs to those who know how to ace the technological race. We know. Most of us still order for the convenience. The argument put forth could be that Zomato/Swiggy are bringing you new customers that would otherwise never visit your restaurant in person, and so any business is good business, no matter how small the margins may be.

However, on further thinking, the food app economy is killing the ""lets go out for dinner"" economy. So less customers over time will choose to visit your restaurant and prefer ordering online, which will cut into your normal profits, and limit your ability to maintain rent/electric etc costs of running a physical restaurant.

I think the end-game is to have every outlet on Zomato/Swiggy eventually turn into a kitchen-front only, working on minimal margins, with the 'middle-man' taking most of the profit, just for providing what used to be a free service (Menus + calling restaurants for delivery). Similar findings could be made in the Uber/Ola economy etc. 

Sad, but this is late stage capitalism at work. Please stop supporting Zomato. I was at a roll stall yesterday and I asked the seller about how Zomato earns as a middleman-service when you're the one charging for service and the customer is paying to you. He explained it to me and I was like, ""So how does it benefit you if they charge you money?"". He said, ""They bring us work."". I was like, ""Do they?"". And he responded, ""No, not really. We're making the same as before, except now Zomato takes away a portion of our earnings."" Hi OP, a quick question for you.

Let's say you're selling a burger via swiggy for 140 (MRP)
If I were to eat at your restaurant, will I be charged the same? What's the cost of an in-store customer versus one who orders via Swiggy or Zomato? If I order online, you save money you otherwise incur on sitting space, electricity, waiter charges, etc..

Don't you think when you account for all this, the money you lose to commissions and discounts on Swiggy/Zomato is same as what you would incur on an in-store customer? The business model is based on optimistic high volume sales.

Yes i believe this stupid 30% 10% loss bearing system should go away. But this model also gets you a higher number of orders, which otherwise you were supposed to rely on your loyal customers.
So if you were selling 10 burgers to your ""loyal"" customers and were earning 10 ₹ per burger.
Not you're obviously selling atleast 20+ burgers at maybe 5₹ profit, plus the customers who walk into your restaurant.

And moreover, its consistent earning. Its a win win situation, if there is a better loss bearing system. 

And restaurant owners also send stale, unedible, low quantity, half orders etc food which on our complaint zomato bears the refund cost. So, i dont think its only zomato's fault if people keep looking to earn money by fraud methods. Which part is a scam and how are they cheating the customer? Is it the commission they charge you or the discount which is passed on to the clients or the delivery fee they are charging?

I am sorry if this comes across as rude but if you are setting up a business relying on a 3rd party to drive orders then you can't say they are scamming you if you don't make as much money as them. A restaurant near my place stuck to their guns and had their own delivery service. They are doing quite well. If there's a restaurant union near your place, pool in some money and start your own online delivery service. You don't need stuff like fancy GPS tracking systems. A good payment gateway and order delivering on time will suffice. I often order food online (Swiggy) and the shit they pull off with the discounts is outright shady. They'll inflate the prices, give discount and bring the total bill to the same price as it was earlier. 

Also, I was at this restaurant a few days ago. I frequently order chicken 65 from this restaurant which is priced around 170 (if you buy directly from the restaurant) and 210 (if you order from Swiggy), so what I've realized is that Swiggy not only inflates the prices but also adds taxes, packaging charges, and delivery charges which knocks up the price to almost 250 which makes no sense. I used to work at an F&B SaaS company/startup. They make website for the restaurant (with their branding and theme and all), where customer can directly place the order (Restaurant get better margin, and they can offer reasonable discount). 

The competition of Swiggy and Zomato had really killed the business from their website almost for most of the clients.

&#x200B;

Burger King used to run a lot of discount on their website, but had dropped their website for ordering completely. Indian mentality is cheap and wants discounts everywhere. 

I will legitimately give more money to apps to click and order instead of talking on the phone for ordering and haggling with the delivery person for change. Tell me straightforward.

What is the % net margin on your business? Can you put together more facts and figures  to help use understand the issue ?

Also, doesnt these apps increase the number of orders for your restaurant ? How do you factor that in ? Huh, for a year now I've been noticing that a plate of Mutton Biryani from well-known and popular joints, here in Chennai (like Buhari, Dindigul Thalapakatti etc...) have priced it around Rs.270-290 or so. Prior to that it used to be around the Rs. 180-220 range (depending on the restaurant). Sure, the prices of other dishes might have obviously been hiked too, but as for now, this is what's coming in my mind.

Is the increase in price have to do with what OP has posted here? Or is it just normal and typical (due to inflation and all) and I'm just overstating things here? 

But, (nearly) 300rs for a plate of Mutton Biryani is just ridiculous, especially for the portion size that is provided to us, imo. Do you think going for a online only restaurant might help reduce your costs. You will be able to rent some small space for just the kitchen, and it doesn't have to be in the main road.

I remember reading that these type have kitchens have started becoming popular in US. Are there such kitchens operating in India now. Guess it’s Uber Cheats Just curious, do u prepare Zomato/Swiggy/Uber Eats orders differently from when a customer orders directly from you or eats in your restaurant? Thanks op. I have heard that now they are opening their own kitchen , they would make high selling food items which are high in demands , its brilliant not having to maintain a shop and just a kitchen when can be at a strategic place in city and on whatever place or floor they want and i have heard they are going to recommend their own Kitchen food since it would be tremendously cheaper since absolutely no or minimal working cost is associated with it , but this is very unjust for all the restaurant business owners because they will finally lose those who actually started using the platform because of the restraunts customers and they certainly can't compete in terms of cost to an outlet specially​ enhanced for online order . Its clearly very Injustice to everyone I may be late to comment on this but I after with OP that zomato earns around 100rs per order . According to one calculation of mine at my local Chinese food stall zomato was earning 40% apart from delivery charges and all. Some restaurants in my area are not on zomato or swiggy they are old restaurants and they get a decent footfall from their loyal customers. 

One restaurant/dhaba I used to go frequently. Bcos of good food and fast service was almost empty in what used to be a rush hour. Out side of it was a number of delivery boys waiting for the orders. I feel people coming to restaurants was more profitable for restaurants then people ordering. I always wondered who is paying the discount % to the restaurant


I noticed the price hike as well, earlier the price of jeera rice was 150, after a week or 2 it hiked to 230

I was like why 

Ur post made it all clear thanks op Instead of crying wolf, have you thought of quitting from zomato or swiggy? That way you don't need to worry about being cheated. u/Bluebaleno damn my mom was right all long, good that she forces me to get up my lazy ass and go to the restaurant from where I want the food. Never actually thought about the restaurant owners. I’ve also noticed that there’s a discrepancy in the prices quoted in the Zomato/Swiggy apps & those quoted on the actual menus in the restaurant. The prices on the app are higher by at least 20 rupees for almost every item. With all the major food delivery apps ZOMATO, UberEats and Swiggy are all operating at a loss. So, I think only the consumers are winning. It's not a 'scam'. It's called the market. These apps can charge whatever margin they want. If you don't like you can order from an alternative.

It's not like there is some law fixing food prices on Zomato. Just being the devil's advocate here for what OP mentions. What's a sustainable business model for them? bare in mind these are not just the only costs.

\- Personnel cost  this includes the tech people(paid premium packages given that the scale is huge) and the delivery

\- Operating server costs (No ordinary stuff considering the reliability and availability requirements of such a massive business)

\- Payment gateway fees(usually \~4% maybe slightly lower due to their scale.)

\- Losses ruled in favor of the  customer.- Making up for the discount's offered to lure more consumer base especially fickle consumers in India and advertising.

Its naive to just look at it from an end consumer perspective. Anyone whose run an online business must know how much money is spent on the intangibles. I personally understand when consumers/stakeholders like OP post this but their expectations are ignorant at times if not inconsiderate.  


Having said that I do not like the discount being forced down your throat OP, OP could you confirm if there is an opt out of such discount for you guys?  


PS: I've worked for quite a few startups under the e-commerce umbrella as a tech guy, such margins are norm. TIL that corporations are sleazy. Imagine that! FML! Have you imagined that without zomato or swiggy you couldn't sell the burger in the first place! No one will travel 5km for a burger!

There no concept called ""potential sale"". Without food delivery service you can't even sell the burger. Very difficult to read and understand your post man. But Delivery companies will obviously charge you,  they are delivering your food to the costumer plus they are providing you a platform to get discovered by more and more people.

The only issue I can see here is the forced discount thing because they app is providing/claiming discount not the restaurant , so apps should give discount from their pocket . Can someone please explain me this properly? I think you people should try forming some kind of unions. So Zomato and Swiggy have no one to get food from and they are forced to treat you guys better. Upvoting for better reach. If you can't afford then why don't you stop the promotion/discount? I bet no app put gun on your head. You could say no to discount. The model the apps are running are not sustainable as of now, I know. We all know these details. I heard some south Indian state is going to take action. See if you could help in the cause. PS: 230 for a burger? Damn.  That's too expensive for me. I'm a broke ass students so I wouldn't know what it's like to eat 230 RS burger. Even the zinger is 140ish something I guess. Do restaurants prepare higher quality food for non discounted over the phone orders? The places I used to order from a couple of years ago delivered great food although at higher prices. Now when I order through apps I've noticed even though the bill is cheaper the quality is not at par in a lot of places. Is this done by restaurants to try to keep up with the discounts? Thanks for sharing. Really appreciate your experience in this. I don't fully understand your problem with the delivery charge though — isn't that a part of their expenses? We as customers should pay some amount for it, right?

Also, I hope you don't mind but it's a little difficult to understand your post. As you mentioned, this isn't your first language and I truly respect your effort in trying to inform us on this important issues.

Here's how I would edit your post, if it helps, try seeing what I've cut out. Will help you write clearer the next time.

*""Hi, I own a restaurant and I just wanted to bring something to light. This is the reason why your food is expensive.*

*Companies like Swiggy, Zomato and Uber Eats charge us restaurants a 25 per cent commission on every order we get. For example, a burger sells for Rs. 250. Minus the commission, it is Rs. 200.* 

*On top of that, their discounts end up killing restaurants and bring the value down even further for us. For example, Zomato's 40-per cent discount of Zomato will cost me Rs. 50-70 rupees on the same burger, which I would end up selling for Rs.130. On top of that is a 5 per cent GST.*

*This unethical behaviour is killing restaurants and local businesses.*

*2) They charge you the customer a MASSIVE 25-35 rupees for delivery per order. Zomato earns almost 100 rupees from you and I. I understand it's a business model, but you need profits and the discounts that they are running will shut us down. Your favourite small time businesses will shut down very soon if this continues.*

*TL;DR:  Zomato, Swiggy, Uber Eats cheat restaurants and customers with their pricing and discount schemes.*

*I apologize for the way I have written as English is not my first language. It's actually one of the few times I've written in English, and that too, on such a long topic. Hope you understand!""* Always knew there has to be something behind those crazy discounts. Looks like the restaurant is being fucked over by the Companies. You get orders because of Zomato. Zomato has the right to enter into arrangement with you and it is up to you to accept or not.

Don't understand the issue here. It seems like you just want to make more money while having the  same volume as you get through Zomato. Can't have it both ways. In a free market economy, fairness in competition is touted to be the usp. In reality, it is the market itself that makes profit while the long tail of market participants die. Those that survive are usually owned by the market itself.

For e.g. if you're swiggy, the bowl company (owned by swiggy) belongs to the top 5% and brings in much more revenue than the entire long tail combined causing them to shut down. Similar with Amazon's brands like solimo etc.

In essence, this is anti competitive and would have resulted in the government to intervene, had it been some other country. The only real force stopping anti competitive practices is legislation, which our country is pissant at. I live in Singapore, I'm not sure about the markets here, but what happens there is that the sellers increase the price of the items available on the apps. You can get the same thing for about 70% the cost if you buy it directly from the restaurant. Can confirm. 22-25% of revenue goes to Zomato Swiggy. Jacking up prices to list therefore is inevitable. Good business opportunity to help small restaurants set up mobile optimized store fronts and bypass swiggy or tomato As a restaurant owner what changes would you like to see?  
Any proposal on how to let the such companies earn also?  
If the company didn't offer delivery but, just listed your menu will you get into an agreement with them? I have absolutely no problem with this.Those delivery orders would never be available for you without those apps.You will be serving to the same customer base and delivery to same people who order and live with in 10-15 minutes of your restaurant.

While I have no doubt the food apps engage in some scummy behavior and strong arm restaurants, restaurateurs need to realize that extra delivery business orders that they generate will not be available for them without these apps.How you choose to deal with that is their prerogative.

I wont order from a restaurant that is pretty far away from my location unless its through the food delivery apps.My business will be limited to nearby restaurants.Its the delivery apps that enable restaurants to get orders from outside their normal circle.You cant expect to get maximum profit from these. > 25% commission + 40% discount + 5% GST

Increase the price of the burger then. And learn some business tactics or economics. Hiking the price then offering a discount gives you more sales than offering the product at the original price.  

You have a hiked up price, which gives you a higher profit margin. Use the margin to offer discounts in your own app (if you have one), or for dine-in customers via Dineout/Zomato Gold.

Discounts have the psycological effect of reducing the price to the customer (despite the overall cost being the same) as well as free marketing (on Zomato/Swiggy and even for dine-in on Dineout/Zomato)

The 25% commission probably includes the charges of card payments (2-3%) as well as the GST on their services provided to you.  

> They charge you the customer a MASSIVE 35 to 25 rupee for the delivery per order Zomato is earning almost 100 ruppes from you and me I understand its a business you need profits but the discounts they are running will shut. Your favourite. Small time businesses very soon

I am never charged above 20 usually. With Swiggy delivery is free due to Swiggy Super. When ordering food, I do not account for delivery charges in Swiggy - because they are discounting the delivery charges. They discount the delivery charges because they get the revenue from your commissions. If the delivery charges are high, I am not going to order at all. I am ordering from restaurants 30-40 minutes away from my home that would never deliver to my area.    

Local restaurants in my area simply build up loyal customers and then stop offering discounts. I know food stalls that are running for years due to Zomato/Swiggy.

> Zomato Swiggy uber cheat the restaurants and you as the customer share this !

No, they provide convenience to the customer that even big companies like McDonalds, Pizza Hut, KFC or Domino's fail to provide.  

Develop your own app that is not crap, and support all payment methods, then I'll consider moving off Swiggy or Zomato. Searching for a restaurant, and clicking order (payment is set up already) takes less than 1 minute for me.  

Box8 (Box8, Mojo Pizza and other brands), Faasos (Faasos, Firangi Bake, Ovenstory Pizza, Sweet Tooth, Behrouz Biryani), Charcoal Eats (Charcoal Biryani, Chilli Flakes Pizza) all have their own apps that work well and offer more discounts than Zomato/Swiggy - so I use their apps when ordering from them. But they also spend on marketing and IT infrastructure. I also run a restaurant. And I'm partnering with these guys to deliver food. But when I think, it's a must for them to charge this rate of commission to run their business and still be profitable. 
If a person orders 100₹ worth food, the delivery person gets to waste about 30-45 mins of his time and travel few kilometres. Who would do it for 25₹-30₹? Customers who order through these apps don’t sit in your restaurant, don’t consume time and effort of your servers, your air conditioning or water. So if you have to pay a percentage to these apps which you save on overheads what exactly is unfair? 

The problem is you want to make the same money whether it’s an online customer or an offline one. These apps help you scale your business and without them you can simply operate as you always have, but you know that would be a lost opportunity. Restaurants in my city already raise their rates on Zomato for every dish. So business is booming for them instead of them going out of business. Customer has to pay more to get it delivered, and it's fair IMO. Zomato cancelled my order 30 minutes after ordering saying that the restaurant was closed. I lost 100 rs. worth coupon and they said that they would 'try' delivering the next order quicker. worst app for food delivery. Period. Man, this is wrong on so many levels. You can take them to court. I just got out of law school. Give me sometime, the least I can do is give you some preliminary legal advice. Why are fast food(burgers, pizza etc) prices the same in the US and in India? A McDonald's burger in the US costs $3, and burgers here sometimes cost more than that! I think you should stop whining. You are free to stop working with zomato and Swiggy, you just prefer working with them because they bring you orders. 

What you described is not cheating by any stretch of imagination, it's business.",Food,2019-05-21 18:58:06
Aging Parents Frustrated with Society and Economy in general,129,cscift,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cscift/aging_parents_frustrated_with_society_and_economy/,82,"Parents live in a tier 2 city in Tamil Nadu. They moved 19 years ago after working PSU jobs all over India for about 35 years. I live in the US and plan to return in a years time to take care of them. The problem is my dad is extremely frustrated with conditions in India - every little thing irks the hell out of him. Milk price went up by single digit rupees, he is angry, the underpaid maid asked for a raise - he is angry. The roads are dug up, he is angry, the plumber asked more than what he expected - he is angry. Modi demonetized, he is angry.  The neighbors work two jobs (husband and wife) and don’t have time to socialize - he is angry. its not like he is short of money, I send a hefty amount every month, but that doesn’t factor into his attitude. Everyday I get messages about the deplorable living conditions and 360 degree greed everywhere. He wants to move to the US and stay with me, this is simply not possible because of several practical and logistic reasons which he doesn’t get. Each time I raise the topic of me moving back, he amps up his complaints about living conditions in India. My question to you folks, are any of your parents in such a situation ? For those of you whose parents once served in the military or lived in organized townships, what’s your experience like and how did you handle it ? Are things really so bad for seniors ?

Edit: 
1. Wow! Thank you all for the advice and suggestions! Some of them have really started a new trail of thoughts for me - so thank you!
2. Many of you have suggested bringing them to the US and have them experience the reality of life here - they have been to the US over 15 times and have spent upwards of 4 months each visit. They see zero problems here, they actually think this is a great lifestyle. We even had serious medical situations but have shielded them from the actual costs.",supersonictaco," My parents are in a similar situation. Worked in a PSU all life and now settled in a tier two city. Their lives are suddenly downgraded by a notch. Can’t blame them for feeling the way they feel. 

I think the most important thing for them is to have a friend circle. Most of their angst will be seeped in. But then again, it’s not a full proof solution. My father is really short tempered and looses his shit over trivial issues. I’ve been working towards getting him engaged in some kinda hobby but it hasn’t worked out. 

It’s a weird place where most of the Indian middle class is right now. Economic and social changes in last fifteen years have been really fast paced. We, the young ones have somehow coped up to an extent but our parents haven’t been able to. It’s not fair to expect it from them. I don’t have a solution but I want you to know that there are many of us out there. You are not alone. Bring them to USA for six months. Either they will assimilate so well that there won't be any practical or logistical hinderances anymore or they will go back with a newfound respect for India. Ask him to stop watching the news on TV! My father watches TV all the time, and believe me, our news channels are milking anger and making people angrier. Newspaper is so much better but news videos on youtube are cancer.

My father lived in the US with me for 6 months. He loved it but he also realized how good things are for *him* in India. He was shocked when I paid 200$ for carpet cleaning :) :). Grass is always greener on other side

He secretly (maybe unbeknownst to himself) is jealous of your situation and wishes to live life like you since he never got such a chance. PSU townships and company towns are comfortable compared to unorganised Indian cities, move them to a gated community. I have an uncle who is similar. Complaints fuck all about every single thing in India. I would say you also complain about things in the US - the high cost of living, healthcare, etc.

I think he looks at US or other developed countries and thinks it is utopia and that frustrates him about living in India even more. So a little dose of reality should help them keep their expectations more realistic. Has he ever been to the US? Why don't you take them for a short trip? I am sorry if this may sound disrespectful or intrusive(no offence intended) If ur parents are retired from a PSU wouldn't they be getting a good pension? > The problem is my dad is extremely frustrated with conditions in India. Every little thing irks the hell out of him. 

> - Milk price went up by single-digit rupees, he is angry, 
- the underpaid maid asked for a raise - he is angry. 
- The roads are dug up, he is angry, the plumber asked more than what he expected - he is angry. 
- Modi demonetized, he is angry. 
- The neighbours work two jobs (husband and wife) and don’t have time to socialize - he is angry.

OP. Are we related? This sounds exactly like my mom and dad. Just bitch about how miserable you are there and how the good things in india aren’t available there and how it’s too cold or hot or wet it is. And how you are racially abused and even the Indians aren’t united. They have caste and regional groupings even there. IMO Its not the money your parents are concerned about.

**If our country, its economy and infrastructure is going to shit, we all should be angry irrespective of how much money we've got !**

I understand that you may have reasons to not stay in US or get them there but frankly I don't see any reason to blame someone who recognizes the seriousness of multiple chronic problems in Indian wants to get away from them. I think your father may have anxiety issues more than anything else. I think after retirement he have lot of free time and every thing he is observing he is finding faults in that, even with you not agreeing to him(that's any parent). I have noticed even my father is facing anger issues lately(post his retirement) but his anger is only on one person. Since he is heart patient I cannot say anything harsh. 

Solution is to keep him busy. Anything that makes him happy. Send him on trips introduce him to some hobby classes. I also have asked my father to tutor kids once he is free from his current commitment. The issue is not money which you mentioned. The issue is may be mid life crisis. They are retired. Living alone in India. I assume they are around 65 to 70 years old. Life definitely is hard for them. They miss their kids and grand kids. If they get it, then they will be happy. Also, they do not socialize enough. As you mentioned the neighbours are busy. In our typical middle class families, many people think too much about their neighbours, I mean poke their nose about what they do. They go insane sometimes. We will also be in that phase in next 30 years. It's natural and real. Move there soon and things will be fine.
Also, after a certain age, they lose their temper and judgement. They become angry, they become bossy. They misbehave. It is very hard to fast changes that are happening around them. They comment something like"" humare zamane mein"". I am surprised no one has brought this up. He wants to be with you. If you move back to India, it will sort one of the problems. You need to take over his finances and make sure he socializes! Retirement is very tough on PSU employees, especially the ones who have worked more than half their lives there. 1. Get a basic health check done. Vitamin D/B issues lead to anxiety and depression and subsequent anger.

2. India today is tougher and more difficult. Massive unemployment that no one acknowledges, farmers living on subsistence, declining health and public facilities etc. In the middle of all this, there is a wave of orthodoxy sweeping smaller towns and that leads to issues as well.

3. Wean them off TV. TV has bombastic news and guaranteed to make people insecure, angry and constantly provoked as hell. I hear you OP. This is Elderitis. I hear so many crazy stories about cranky elders in my parents' social circle. Each one has a major gripe(hilariously silly in my eyes) over which they utterly lose their shit for weeks. I tried to stop my parents from interacting with negative-like-a-plague seniors(DIL hates us, son wants bigger share than daughter, bones are aching) but it is futile.

The only elders that I see happy are those living in a gated apartment community, have a group that meets daily for walks, have a spouse who is alive, dependable caretakers and kids settled abroad for good. Money is not a solution at all, and having their adult kids living with them usually introduces a different set of problems on a hellish scale.

The lasting solution has to come from the elders themselves. I try my best to make time to talk to my parents about good times, and on topics that interest them. This alleviates the situation to some extent but ultimately it is their mindset that will be the deciding factor.(I know an aunty whose 2 grand-daughters are in cushy jobs and nice marriages, but she moans 24x7) >I send a hefty amount every month

Your parents don't have their retirement sorted, after working for 35 years? Are *you* planning for your retirement or would you expect your children to fund your retirement too?

>He wants to move to the US and stay with me, this is simply not possible because of several practical and logistic reasons

What are these reasons? And how do you think your moving back to India will make everything A-OK for your parents? and for you? Your dad sounds like a real pain in the ass if I’m being honest. If he’s cribbing about the cost of living in India, imagine the shock he’d get if he ever moved to the US. 

You should fly him out for a couple of weeks. That should set him straight and realize how good he has it > Milk price went by single digit rupees

Doesn't milk cost $8 for a gallon in US?

> the underpaid maid asked for a raise - he is angry

He's not going to have a maid in US, who's going to take care of him then?

Money isn't a thing, I guess he has a rose tinted view of US for some reason. If you were living in Europe then I could understand his excitement for living there but I won't prefer living in US in old age. Medicines are expensive and you have got no one to help you(unless the wife is a homemaker)

Try to make him understand how things are in US. Tell him that things aren't cheap and you can't haggle. Plumbers and maids will empty his pockets. If he's complaining about neighbours now, what makes him think Americans around you, or even Indians living around you will be ecstatic to talk to him? He's just the complaining type, it's alright OP, you do you. Mom's are great, they usually have their duties they do everyday, and have done so for years.  Including worrying about you, and tryhing to help.  Dad's are great, if they have something to do in retirement.  However, Dad's who focused on money at work and ignored family with no retirement plan execpt to hang out at home are trouble.  They did what they did and focued on Money for the family, and little else.  If they don't have a ""retirment"" buisness, they feel abandonded by kids who are not at home asking for advice, and being able to give it.  ""Retirment"" for the middle class will not be kind in the Consumer Era with Intrest rates higher than 3%.  Basically in this situation, inflation of 7-12% is making stuff out of reach for what he could buy when he was working and intrest rates are a bit less than inflation.

Even if there were grandkids to take to school and bring back, he would feel abandonded and unable to contribute.  Something simple as being a landlord will give him puropose or managing some property for you.  In other words, he needs a purpose where profit is involved Instead of being ""stewing"" his how his retirment income can't keep up with and increasing costs.  And we are not taking about simple things, we are talking about asparational consumerism.  I.e. keeping up with the neighbors and former colleagues, who have moved to better places(using their sons money).  Unless you are giving him tons of money, or he does not have a job he won't be happy.

The other thing to keep in mind, India is not what it was.  City dewalks and public transport are unusable by the older folks (dad's included).  India was not about making infrastructure usable for older folks to get out of the hosue.  So when the average congested neihbroorhood streets get ripped up for bigger cars, there is no place local place to walk to.  The wealtheir have the manicured lawns and gated communiteis.  So they need to use the more expensive transportation, which they didn't use when they were working.  And even frustrates me,  imagine how it bothers your dad. Have you considered advising or arranging for your father to seek psychiatric help? Walnut one per day, shelled opened before eating, eaten before dinner, (1, ask doctor if he is on any medication if its ok to eat walnuts, 2, if he is on blood thinners medication then also you can't do this)

My life changed

My mum's life changed

My entire house changed

If it works out for you, let me know in a week and pay it forward Tell them about the gun violence/shootings in US. Tell them about the racism not whites have to face. Tell them about the cost of living/maid etc. 

Also how most of the people may feel homesick in US, how bad the kulcha is there, people hooking up left and right etc. He's complaining most probably because he wants to move to the US. As someone said, if it's possible to get him a short trip, he might see the conditions there and help him decide on what to do. you should be proud of your Father that he's not a Bhakt. Things are how you expect it to be, not great for all, but nothing bad specifically for elders. With an average 5% inflation rate prices are bound to go up. The infrastructure in this country has almost always been the same with snail paced improvement.

Looks like his frustration is *not just* about society in general but could be something else. You mentioned that you do send money for them. How do you think it's going to be any different after you come back? Something: exists

OP's dad: Vada vom vom vada vom vom vada vom He's retired, my guess is he doesn't really have a hobby to pass the time. So he is using the national pass time, getting angry at trivial things. This is what happens when you work your ass off on a job and then when you get home you are too tired to do anything else. You don't know what to do with your life after retirement.

Ask your dad to ditch Whatsapp & Youtube garbage and do something productive with his time. Something he can enjoy doing. Yeah sure this sounds like child parenting the parent, but this is what he needs.

You can also try getting him a pet. Pets are wonderful creature and can help regulate behavioral problems in people. Even something as low maintenance like a parrot can do the trick. saving this thread hoping for an answer! we are lucky that a close relative stays at our place to take care of my parents, we provide housing and food obviously and send money home for food and related expenses, but yes we are always on tenterhooks as life under Modiºs rule things are very very unpredictable, in our area, maids and assorted labour like gardners, plumbers etc. seem to have disappeared and we have to get them from very far off. food pricing hikes is another pain in the neck, things like flooding and riots etc, just mean more tension for us out here. But so far we have managed to get by all thanks to the one guy staying with my parents. > My question to you folks, are any of your parents in such a situation ?

No. But, I am in your parents' situation. A complaining sourpuss. You will have to ask my kids few years from now. Brought my parents to the US for a month's visit. They don't want to come back. 
Socia life sucks, food sucks, no one on the roads, too cold, every thing is so far away etc. were some of the reasons. It seems like the problems you've mentioned aren't the ones that are really the cause of their irritation. Probably they are just anxious and a little stressed out about something. Could be because it's a new place, or because you aren't around them, or some other thing in their lives. You need to help them feel secure and comfortable, and really address the source of their anxiety. They dnt have hobbies?",Food,2019-08-19 13:08:51

Wtf how does that even find it's way into a kitchen. Everyone always names swiggy immediately in such posts. So far, there's no name of restaurant which is the real culprit. Just eat it man.

Jagan Reddy should not have cancelled Amravati out of spite for CBN. Now good luck convincing farmers anywhere else in the country to voluntarily give up their land for urbanization.  

This guy is cancelling anything that CBN started...including renewable energy projects with Japanese loans. Who will invest without continuity and predictability Jagan is a fucking idiot. Can someone explain why they didn't make Vishakhapatnam as the new capital? Or Vijayawada? Genuinely curious. The funny thing I really don't understand is why people are so concerned about agricultural land. All major cities across the world and in India was constructed on good agricultural land. You cannot be like that Muslim sultan construct the city in a place with no water source. That is basically useless people need to stop dreaming and come to reality. Vizag was already getting so many software companies and policies of the new government of AP has put all investments in the limbo including this Amaravati one. Populism in a state which already is so much under debt isn't a sensible choice at all. Lol at the artist representation. Aaisa infra India mein kabhi nahi banega. Naya Raipur ...same fate. Nobody lives there, yet crores and crores spent. The project was very utopian. With hyperloop metro and god knows what. Just make it a minimalistic capital like Gandhinagar or Chandigarh or Naya Raipur and then let the ecosystem around it grow. india is becoming the next china. lol . ghost cities. And people were laughing at China, saying that this can only happen in China because opposition within a democracy makes sure the government does not waste money on such thing. Amaravathi is not seen as people's capital ,it is seen as capital for only kamma caste landlords . People of AP unequivocally rejected amaravathi since jagan never promised anything more than a administrative capital due to states poor financial situation .   

Why construct a capital on a flood plain with zero government land ?  Why does capital need to be the focus of investment ? Everywhere around the world modern capitals are small administrative cities with no industry whatsoever .   

Most people from AP are extremely happy that government is not borrowing thousands of crores to enrich a select few . Damn for a minute I thought it was Maharashtra's Amravati Here is the real situation of amaravathi , don't believe the lies and graphics of Chandra babu .

Online food delivery apps Zomato and Swiggy have much to thank India’s small towns for,126,cf3lw2,https://scroll.in/article/930862/in-charts-who-leads-the-race-between-zomato-and-swiggy-and-where,22,,Mizark123," Living in a tier 2 city at present. One of the reasons these apps are so popular here probably is because while the food in the restaurants is decent, the ambiance is terrible at most restaurants. It's much more comfortable to order food and eat at home. The discounts also help. A dish costing 300 rs in a restaurant costs 240 rs if I order from swiggy. Sometimes crunchiness or freshness takes a hit, but when it doesn't, online food ordering is wonderful. The bandwagon effect is too damn prevalent in Hyderabad. Take any fucking thing, once fire catches, everyone would be doing the same thing. Everyone watches the same comedy shows, everyone watches the same movies, everyone goes to 'ram ki bandi' at 12am and everyone visits Charminar in the night to feel they're the 'cool' guys.

Everyone seems to be using swiggy now. My 8 year old nephew, my >50 year old parents inclu. I know many college kids who now deliver on swiggy for pocket money, and the next day they'd ordering from swiggy to spend that money. It's so funny. They don't deliver to my place. 😞 How is Hyderabad a Tier-2 city? I am from a small town. A suburb of Mumbai though. Swiggy & Zomato do not even provide service here. Now we have our own exclusive app. Almost spent 7-8k on online food orders , people are becoming more lazy and eating more outside food without even going out.  
this will lead to more health issues as we all know about the hygiene standards and ingredients at restaurants.",Food,2019-07-19 13:34:45

With this, there is no way things are going to improve for Anganwadi now. How the fuck we allow such baboons to represent us. I agree : Let's make toilets inside temples.

Better than having 600 million street poopers Why do they defend this shit?

They just need to say 'We are looking into this issue and will take appropriate action once we ascertain the facts'.

It's that's simple. And our ministers cannot even do this. I can't fathom their logic. They act similar to a dog that was given a bath because it was dirty. And post the bath,at the first  given opportunity, the dog will jump back right into the mud. They just can't stand staying clean.

I live in a hosel and eat mostly from my office canteen or from outside. I'm spending more than 250 bucks a day and still my calorie intake barely cross 2000. There are no facilities to cook where I stay nor do I get the time to.

Can anyone provide suggestions?",azorahai7," You can drink Sattu everyday. If you are drinking it from the road it will cost you 10 Rupees. If there are no Sattu vendor then you can buy them online or from a store (a small packet costs 25 Rupees, will last 2 glasses. So 1 glass=12.5 Rupees). Search Google or YouTube for tutorial about how to make it (spoiler: you will have to add onions, chilli, black paper in that drink)

A glass of Sattu has approximate 327 calories, low fat and 27 grams of protein. It is 100% organic and natural. It also keeps you full for a long time. It's very popular in Bihar, West Bengal, Nepal etc and especially among labourers because it's cheap and gives instant energy.

I'm in the same boat. Trying to gain weight and build some muscle. But I can't afford any supplement. So I drink one glass of this Desi drink everyday (hoping to drink 2 now), the results have been satisfying so far. Of that 2500, what's your preferred breakdown in terms of protein/carbs/fat and what are you getting right now? Peanut butter hands down, but only if you like the taste. Banana shake? Chicken 65 Peanuts.

A 50g Haldiram Salted Peanuts costs 10/- and has more than 300 calories and its too tasty. You can easily much 3-4 packets a day :-) Peanuts have high protein content too, which would help in muscle building too. Basically peanut butter smoothies with whey protein, one extra meal a day, Greek yogurt when you feel hungry. You also need to workout more intensely. I guess Upma is calorie rich with the ghee and all? Blend 100gm oats, one big scoop of peanut butter, one big banana and 250ml milk(or soy milk if you can't take milk). Add curd/yogurt if you want. That should get you close to 600+ calories. Visit /r/gainitmeals for more such shakes. Eat fried things and lots of sugar and fat stuff.",Food,2019-07-21 16:29:05

But I'm not so sure about jail hygiene, from what I have heard about conditions in jail. Brilliant. Getting them to work. I don't understand why anybody can think this is a good idea. Looking at prison labor as profit is a dangerous slippery slope, not to mention that the laborers are being denied the fruits of their labor. This is highly unethical. No one should make money from prison or prisoners. If you don't want to waste the products prisoners create, give them for free.

I was wondering is this all that there is to life? A fellow teenage Indian has taken r/Tinder by storm and here I am, just spending days beating my meat! Exactly a month ago someone promised me a beer treat in South Delhi when I was broke. Kind people exist but get lost soon :( So there was this street puppy that was born near my home. I used to give her roti, milk etc every day twice a day since her mother brought her out from the dry drain shelter (in which she had given birth). In about a month or two, the puppy was in good health and a rich black shiny fur. But then she (puppy) died suddenly. Something happened to her and she didn't eat for 2 days and died on the 3rd. Her death affected me so much emotionally, I was surprised. So I have decided not to own a dog, because I just can't imagine the grief when a dog dies (naturally) after 10-15yrs.

(My bday is not in July. Or anywhere nearby. Just recalling) Last night in Goa! What a premium grown up trip I had! So I am going through arrange marriage process and I will use this thread to post my daily updates, if that is okay.

I am 30, M. I work in IT. Never had a GF. Two years ago, I was deeply infatuated with a close friend of mine and she said no when I expressed my feelings. I was depressed for a while, but somehow got better. I still have my bad days. But, from that point on I have become socially awkward. I can't hold a conversation, properly at all. Sometimes, I go blank and I don't know what to say. This never used to happen with me earlier!

Signed up on Matrimony sites and I got soooo many matches/interests. That actually felt good, lol. 

So I was talking with a girl, my first match and turns out she uses reddit too. We had a nice convo around for an hour and that was the longest convo I could have, after that incident. Come next day, I was not able to talk at all. I was able to see that she was putting effort and trying to make better for me. But, for how long? Next day I messaged her, but same stuff. I apologised to her and lied her this is not working for some reason. This was 3 months back. 

Next stories / meetups have also been same. But I will tell them about later! Finally going for further education after a year and half. Looking forward to this! Going to sleep, fuck you all. Yesterday i learnt that if somebody compliments you, you compliment them back and never pop medicines without prescription. Any good vape eliquid websites ? 
And good eliquid which you are aware of ? Goodnight and kiss to u/ssj_cule College 1st year is going to start from next month, hope I can have fun.

In the last seat, the last window [behind the last woman reserved seat] i saw a girl and a boy. Barely 4-5 years younger than me [say first second year of college]. In that packed bus i saw the the boy bending slightly to the front and turn to the girl and go in and the girl reciprocated and landed a kiss on the boy's lips. Then the boy went further low and landed a kiss on the girls left boob. All this within 2 seconds. 

I laughed slightly at the young kids' experience of love but just then fear grasped me. What if anyone else saw? What if other other people grab hold of them and start beating them? I know Kolkata is not an idiotic cow belt city but even here sometimes these arent accepted by the old farts [remember the couple beaten in Kolkata Metro last year?]

I then questioned the very point of India, where people cant even live and love without fear.

I did not know where else to post this, so I hope this is appropriate. I've never in my life tried Indian food until today. Where I work, at the cafeteria, I decided I would try some Indian food. I honestly do not know what I even got.. to my regret.. I just pointed at something random and they served me a plate of this chicken with some type of thickish orange sauce (some type of curry?). It was honestly the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. Anyways, there's an Indian restaurant near me and I plan on ordering food there tomorrow. What are your recommendations of what I should try next? I'm thinking of a chicken entree. 

Here are my options for that:

https://imgur.com/uZ9XO4M",WinRARHF," Personally I'm a non Indian who loves all things India. I'm a mostly white girl from Indiana. (no relation, lolol)

I love both butter chicken, which I think you had, and chicken tikka masala.  Those are great easy starters. A biryani is a meat mixed with rice dish. Unless it says veggie biryani lol. 

Tarka dal (various spellings) is delicious, that's a lentil dish.  Any dal is a lentil dish, those are staples and there are a million kinds but a few classics. Chana means chick pea.  there are ""saag""  dishes, these are greens. Spinach, etc. If it says aloo that means potato. Paneer is a kind of un-aged cheese, like queso blanco. Something described as pakora will be fried. 

Then there are all the pickles and chutneys. 

Most things will be richly flavorful but they don't have to be spicy the way a lot of people think about that word.

Edit: thanks for all the love on this comment. You guys are great. 

I'm going to admit some cultural appropriation here. I have a tattoo that is an Indian saying written in Sanskrit. It was r/India who helped me decide the best way to write it, and what you guys came up with makes it a paradox, which I love. It reads both ""a garland in a monkey's hand"" and ""a garland in Lord Vishnu's hand"". I got it as an homage to my love of India and as a reminder to myself to not be the monkey OR the garland. To be a good steward of the delicate and the vulnerable both in myself and in others. 

To those who might take offense that I did that, I am sorry. I know it's kind of gauche but I love my tattoo & get compliments on it almost daily--there are flowers around it, specific flowers with specific meanings, and it's done in a henna kind of style. Thus far, no one has told me that it actually says ""waiting for the number six bus"" so I'm hoping it doesn't... There's a high chance you just tried India's greatest gift to the culinary world - butter chicken. 

What you should order tomorrow really depends on what kind of flavours you like. Since you're just exploring, try the chicken tikka masala, and pair it up with a couple of naans of your choice. Did you buy WinRAR license? Hi OP ! There is a sub dedicated to r/IndianFood if you want to dive deeper. And you might get more nuanced suggestions there.  Also my choice from your list would be the 'Methi CHicken' as it will be completely different from what you tried yesterday(probably CHicken tikka masala. Ha-ha, welcome to your lifelong addiction my friend-take it from one who knows, once you pop, you just can't stop. I'm a 51 year old white guy from a provincial town in the UK. My first experience was aged 15 in an Indian corner shop called 'Johals' in my hometown. Knew the guys in there fairly well to talk to. Went in one day for milk and spotted a box of triangular pastries on the counter..

""What are those Mr Johal?"" 

""They're samosas RajBandar"" 

""What's a surmiser?"" 

""Samosa. They're nice, try one, free of charge"" 

I thanked him & walked out of the shop. Went up the road munching it, and despite the *tiny* amount of chilli inside blowing my head into orbit & making my eyes and nose pour,(I'd never tasted chili before this)  I'll never forget biting down on a freshly roasted cumin seed and letting that floral, earthy flavour bomb detonate and dance across my tastebuds. Twenty five years later I got on a plane at Heathrow for Delhi. In a happy miracle it all happened again! The Indian food I'd experienced at home was sort of the same but in India..my god, I can't describe the first time I had a simple thali and a garlic naan. I stepped into the desi elevator and took a straight vertical ride to food heaven. And a literal auto ride to Old Delhi. I could bore the shit out of this sub for *hours* rattling on about soft galuti kebabs, gossamer-thin rumali roti, daulat ki chaat disappearing on my tongue, *feeling* diabetes setting in after two gulab jamoon & some burfi from Haldiram, not caring and having more....etc etc. Even a simple masala chai on the corner and talking gupshup with the chaiwallah unkill while I drink it brings me deep joy these days. Especially when he opens the tin he keeps under the counter, opens it and offers it to me, saying *""Biskoot?""* 

If any other *gorapakora's* are reading this and thinking about travelling to India to sample her delights, edible & otherwise, stop thinking & do it., you won't be sorry. If you're anything like me you'll be unequivocally, incurably, head-over-heels in love from the outset.

Edit; I'm still getting on planes 12 ish years later and going to India. Trip number ten in the autumn and nine months has been too long for this masala junkie. I'm straining at the leash to get back, see you soon *Mataji Bharat* ❤️ Chicken Tikka Masala is something I've heard a lot of non-indians like. So you can try that. Most of these are going to be similar to one another. No way this place has that much differentiation sitting around. I would go with Chicken Kadhai, it's a bit spicer than the others. Go for dosa and chutney/sambar during breakfast lol. Many non Indians like that..
Have tea/coffee along with that. Should be good. 

Tastes even better if it's raining outside! Come to India lol. You'll be mind blown. You should try biryani. Try indian sweets like gulag Jamie, rashgulla, jalebi Considering those are options that you have, then try them in the following order. Have them with naan, or tandoori roti or just plain rice. Order a side of green salad or make one at home.  

1. Chicken Korma
2. Chicken Muglai
3. Chicken Kadai
4. Butter Chicken
5. Chicken Tikka Masala
6. Chicken Saag
7. Chicken Jalfrezi
8. Chicken Curry
9. Chicken Vindalo
10. Chicken Kolapuri

2. **Afghani chicken**, named differently depending upon place to place.. it's works as starter with drinks, it's basically chicken with lot of cream on it, it's totally yum! again high in calories but not as high as BC.

3. **Tandoori Chicken**, baked in [tandoor](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1CR8sQXXXXXaUXVXX760XFXXXt/229253608/HTB1CR8sQXXXXXaUXVXX760XFXXXt.png). Basically a spicy chicken marinated with indian masalas and roasted in Tandoors. It also works best with a beer, also less in calories(though also depends upon how much oil you put).  


These are main three chicken cuisines, you should try, rest of the things mentioned on menu are branched from these three only. Also, these three are named differently depending upon place to place. Tell you what, chicken tikka masala with either roomali rotis and a cheese garlic naan.

Butter chicken with plain naan and rice.

Chicken kadahi with naan.

These would be the most preferred combinations here. Then you can sample the rest. 

But be sure to have some water nearby. I have seen a few Europeans eat the same dishes with gusto in Goa and then be covered in perspiration. 

All the best! I LOVE THIS THREAD. You've have had lot of chicken dishes suggestion, I'll just say do try some Indian veg food too, it will get you an appreciation of veg food. first step done, now try cricket. [deleted] Try Jalfrezi next time.

On a side now, I hope your body is ready for tomorrow.

Don't 'lose' hope, exotic food will reshape your gut flora! 😂 [deleted]

Is good a sub You should choose depending on your spice bearing ability and how spicy that particular restaurant makes it. Butter chicken and Chicken korma would be kinda less spicy usually. A good korma would be delicious with Indian breads. Butter chicken is a classic. You could also try these curries with ""ghee rice"" or plain rice. You can ask for ghee rice they would probably make it for you.  Chicken Vindaloo is a goan preparation that is vinegary and goes well with plain rice more than breads. The rest are more suited to be had with breads. You can try Chicken Mughalai once !! r/IndianFood",Food,2019-06-07 09:08:10

The complaint was addressed and bed roll was provided within next 10 minutes. Also got a confirmation call for ticket closure. Didn't expect this kind of service.,ccchn," How to register complaint online? Through irctc? Railways services have improved a lot in last 6 years or so. Food is better and complaints are addressed really fast and the damned website got facelift. i have had opposite experience travelling in north side trains , despite making reservations sleeper feels likle general coach with over crowding. To avoid it i started booking 3Ac , even then people used to enter and crowd the coach. When complained on twitter they would respond saying action will be taken but nothing happened. When i arrive at destination i get message saying action taken :< Not in shadabhi and rajthani atleast, they provide bf lunch and dinner in a small amount that you have to buy again by either paying the distributor or get down in next station and buy from shops selling eateries

Edit: before privatization quantity and quality was far better I have used something like coachmitra and got the 2AC compartment cleaned once. It works. I dont think it would work out in sleeper coaches though. We have very low expectation of Indian railways because it has a monopoly. Imagine if there were Jetrailways, Indigorailways, Kingfisherrailways, and Indian railways simultaneously, cleanliness and service would have had their own level! Hey OP.

I'm putting up this post to warn you people, that if you use Swiggy, please be careful. Please see the images that I've posted.

Did you order from Burger King and Swiggy switched the order? The images are ambiguous. Does burger king even give samosa? I once accidentally ordered from burger Singh instead of Burger King.  





Burger King lost a customer from that day. Lol. Another ignorant post from someone who doesn't know how food delivery and aggregator app works. 

You got the food from where you ordered. Swiggy didn't ""sell"" you anything from ""fake"" place. 

Swiggy isn't at fault here, they will list anyone which legit restaurant.  And it seems Burger Kings is legit. 

The people running burger kings are at fault here. They just gamed the system but it is upto Burger King to protect their trademark and not swiggy's.

Open a restaurant named Pizza Huts all you want, it's only pizza hut's problem and no one else. 

Google about Starbucks and SardarBaksh. That Murugan Idly logo tho....

DAE see what I see? Swiggy and zomato have both become massively shiet..... 

Wherever I open the app it says 25 minutes, as soon as I place the order it says 35..... I'm lucky if the order comes in 45

Zomato being far worse has kept me waiting for 90 minutes with their constant useless update ""saaar your order is on it's way and arriving shortly"" You didn’t miss anything. Why anyone would eat the crap served by Burger King, kfc and other chutiya chains while there are hundreds of alternatives is beyond me. The real question is, how was the burger?

The restaurant I went to in Kerala has paper straws,64,csgimn,https://i.redd.it/7pqhk4liheh31.jpg,55,,rosesan," I thought it was a pretty normal thing now. Most of Bangalore eateries have this. I rarely see plastic straws these days. KFC, Taco Bell etc in Delhi have started using paper straws. McDonalds have gone 1 step ahead and stopped giving straws altogether. OP has been dining under a rock so far. I had these in Mumbai as well but they don't really last long. Must be soiling after a few minutes. I have seen that in quite a few restaurants/movie theatres in Kolkata.

But they are not a very good idea at all, as they don't last very long! Especially when you are watching a movie, and sipping your Coke slowly for 2 hours... after about half an hour the paper straw starts disintegrating, and it doesn't work any more! I generally asked for 3 or 4 straws and kept replacing them after 15-20 minutes. That's why a lot of places have stopped using them, since customers complained. Same in Navi Mumbai. Lot of restaurants now do that. Even in Mumbai. I got a shocked reaction from shop keeper when I asked for Plastic straws. He told only paper straws. Rs. 2 for each. Hello caveman! Is that beer ? You having beer with a straw ? Kolkata KFC has also started using paper straws. They may be bio degradable but I dont think they are recyclable.A step in the right direction, for now Ginger lemonade? Haldiram also gives biodegradable plates and straws Many restaurants in Gurgaon do that brah Single use plastic is banned in most states. Literally everywhere in Delhi I was in Pondicherry last week, all restaurants I visited had paper straws, including the ones at airport. That drink doesn't even need a straw? They were being used in Pune too in many shops. Lensing them in the drink for a minute rendered them useless. There's a resort in Bangalore that has Bamboo straws Drink fast op, they get sogggy They have been used for quite a while in my state. Not sure where OP is from where this isn’t normal.

What kind of lifestyle could one live with 35k pm in Bangalore?,51,cwvmvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cwvmvg/what_kind_of_lifestyle_could_one_live_with_35k_pm/,31,"Any rough outline from people who are living there?

Age 23, bachelor, moving there soon. 

I'd be happy with a private room to sleep but I'm not sure if that's feasible. I don't need to send anything back home. How much can I save, if any? 

I should be getting about 35k in hand

Would appreciate responses from people living there. Thanks!",twinklex," 35K is good amount to live in bangalore and can save much as well.

1. Bachelor - look out for PG which allows to prepare food of your own (5K to 7K max) based on your work location.

2. Purchase rice cooker with extra bowl

3. Prepare your own food

4. Avoid malls as much as possible. Once in 2 months is better

5. If you booze, bring it your room and have it rather than going to pubs.

6. Do not buy unnecessary gadgets.

7. Most important open ppf account + auto schedule savings so that you won't be spending much.

8. If you love traveling, use trains which is lot cheaper way

I lived in bangalore for 4 years with 30k as my salary For a simple lifestyle: home cooked meals, taking buses/metro for travel, not going out much, renting a room, ₹35k should let you live comfortably and save some too.

For a more lavish lifestyle, going out for food/drinks often, taking cabs/autos for travel, renting a single BHK(in a good part of the city), ₹35k can become 0 very soon in a month.

So based on your habits, one can either make it or break in Bangalore. Post in r/Bangalore I haven’t lived in Bangalore for a few years now but my guess is that if you look hard enough you may get a decent single room for ~ Rs 10 - 15k. You can stay in a PG which even served food for much cheaper.       

Obviously there’s no limit to how much you can spend .. even 1 lakh per month if you go out just in weekends to fancy pubs and bars but if you cook at home, and go out occasionally you can live decently. General Rule - Don't spend more than 25% of your salary on rent.  Which means 8.75k. 

Save before you spend. Open a separate account and park money there as savings. Don't touch this money except in case of emergencies. I strongly suggest saving 25% of your salary. Since you are quite young. You can just go for liquidity and not invest anything for at max 2 years ( But I seriously suggest investing as soon as you can).

Make your own food. Cooking is a skill which every person should have. Yes it might be convenient to hire a cook/ tiffin service, but none will match the hygiene and nutrition of dishes you can make yourself. Food deliveries should be reserved for special occasions or once in a while lazy nights. 

Drinking/Dining out  is very  expensive. Should be a bi-monthly affair at the most. Travelling expense will depend on the location of your room and office. But who are we kidding this is banglore will be a 1hr affair at the very least. I hope metro's service has improved since I was last there. For a long commute bus/metro is the only option. For a short commute you'd be much better buying an old 2-wheeler.   


In an ideal world. 

25% - Rent

25% - Savings

25% - Living Expense( Groceries, Travelling, Bills)

25% - Investment. This is about my friend. He stays in a 2bhk high profile apartment with his friend at Domlur near Indira Nagar. So he gets a bedroom, bathroom and balcony whole for himself. Monthly rent is 28k. They share, so he pays 14k per month. They have a gym in the club facility in apartment.

They hire a domestic help who comes daily and clean the house including bathroom. Monthly expenditure for that is 2000. They hire a cook who come daily morning and evening and cook for three times a day. Her payment is 5000 per month. The average amount for groceries a month is Rs 5000. Since they divde this, each person spends 6000.

His office is just nearby, so he walks daily. If at all he can't monthly travel expenditure would come maximum 2000. Internet and electricity would come upto 1000 per person.

These are his bare minimum expenditure. Considering your case, I can say you will have 12k at hand after spending so much and living luxuriously. With that you can eat out, travel, party or save. Solo 1bhk-2bhk Rent : 12-15k

Maid(s) : 5k

Internet, Mobile, Electricity, Cable : 3k

Groceries for one person : 5k

&#x200B;

That leaves you with about 7k pm. I am assuming you are to commute by office shuttles/cabs and for other travelling even if you use Ola/Uber, an average of 4 trips per week at about 150/- it comes to about 2.5k for commuting.

That still leaves you with 4.5k to splurge on entertainment - movies, meals, shopping etc

Not much left, but then this is the cost of comfortable living, you could choose to go the PG route or share an apartment with friends and save on rent, maid, groceries etc. To be true, it depends on how  frugally you can live.

The rent can be anywhere from 7k to 15k.  

Food depends on you, are you good with skipping the dinner and having milk and fruits, thus saving some money and keeping your systems in check.

Have a heavy lunch, that too depends on where your job is, is the company providing meals or you have to uber or zomato the meal.  

Commute can be anywhere from ₹10 in a local bus to ₹70 for an Uber auto for the same distance. I'm spending about 25k for expenses monthly. That too, I'm living a pretty luxurious lifestyle. I think 35k is good enough for a bachelor Just above bare minimum.",Food,2019-08-29 11:51:24

"Floods in Sikar, Rajasthan",508,chx6ho,https://v.redd.it/vjt9kmhj8kc31,73,,ravihanda," Rain harvesting kar lo bhai! Those people seems to be super calm and unfazed considering the water force and the whole situation. Water water everywhere, not any drop to drink. This city has the most useless water sewer system.

Edit: Its mine city. Anyone else immediately thinks of desert after hearing Rajasthan? [deleted] Don't drink this water guys, it will make you Sicker. But shops are still open. get dem surfboards out Fuck! That's my city! Well shit. Climate change is for real. Whilst not many people paid attention to it with its onset, but come natural disasters and tons of other problems, people are all in words and concern for their mother nature!

Following the same concern, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change urged its member nations to shoulder an equity-based share of adaptive and mitigation responsibilities to overcome the threatening crisis. The conference of parties unveiled some possible impacts of this change and they are far more bleaker than you could ever imagine.

As for developing countries like India, these effects are even more scary.

As for India, a nation whose GDP depends heavily on agriculture; the expected mean rise of 3ºC temperature by the end of the century, irregularity in rainfall, rise in sea levels posing risk of submergence to the coastal cities of Mumbai and Chennai and more frequent and destructive coastal storms are just some of the threats that would haunt the spirits of its inhabitants.

Among the many consequences of these which include, rising sea levels and a constant threat of irregular climate disasters like the ones in Uttarakhand and Chennai in the recent years; there’s something far worse.

India is a country of 1.2 billion people! Now with such a vast and ever-increasing population, we consume grains in bulk, whose production exactly is predicted to fall in the forthcoming years.

Read: Climate Change: Why We Must Be Worried More Than Ever Before - antWHIRL

A study by Dasgupta, 2013 projects an overall decline in food grain production by 18 per cent within the next 30 years! Such a downfall in the production of food grains can be directly related to the deterioration of Indian economy, given the huge dependence on agriculture both economically and socially.

So, in short; Climate change if not battled would bring in not only occasional misery with various disasters, it would sweetly serve us with the menace of prolonged starvation and unemployment!

So, what is India planning to do?

Rape the child, blame the muslim, protect the cow.

Oh and build statues to characters from fables.

What should you do? Ignore the naysayers and GTFO out of India ASAP. That guy is so happy, he got a water park right in front of his house I like how people in the video don’t give a fuck at all!

Anyone else noticed the dip in quality of local restaurants after Swiggy/Zomato blew up?,292,cm4btg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cm4btg/anyone_else_noticed_the_dip_in_quality_of_local/,43,"It like they no longer give a fuck about people who eat at restaurants instead of ordering.

At least two of my regular places have went to shit after Swiggy bullshit took over.

Dine in area basically feels like extended kitchen. Employees randomly packing orders wherever they want. No proper fans or lighting. 

Other suspicious things like selling tandoori chicken and shawarma when both of equipment clearly hasn't been used for some time.

They used to have hot tandoor baking fresh chicken one side and fresh shawarma on another throughout the day.

Now they probably just make it in bulk, then heat it up whenever ordered.

I also noticed a dip in proper manner/courtesy. Dine in customers are probably no longer their primary customers and they treat you like that. 

Then there is also the repulsive business model of companies involved.

Honestly someone should start a trend of ""This hotel/restaurants does not take orders from Swiggy/Zomato"" places. Like those ""Veg only"" places.",Poo_C," That may be true but did anyone notice quality of Swiggy plummeting down. New delivery boys who don't even know how to use the app navigation and rude behaviour. Nothing ever happens even if you complain so they just keep getting ruder every month. You regular the wrong places I guess. The places I regular are still fine except that service takes a bit longer than usual as online orders get priority. But since I mostly am out with my family I do not mind. 

I have a couple of places near me who do not take orders from swiggy/ zomato. they are good too, but take a similar time in serving. Again the delay does not bug me, so alls good. They are getting paid 50-60 bucks(30% commission + 30-50% discount + returns, cancellation and scams) for a 200 rs tandoori chicken by the swamato due to the competition, fomo and monopoly in the market. Dude always remember that if you are eating out or ordering food you are eating extremely unhygienic food. My friend who is now chef at third restaurant has seen some shit. He never eats out. No matter from where you order. Shit has got the fan since order delivery services came. Because customer is not even at restaurant to see if quality of kitchen is up to standard or not. That was just a one time experience for me. There's a pizza outlet where I went to. The times when I had food at their place, It was amazing. When I ordered through swiggy, it sucked badly Not sure about dining in, but I have definitively noticed a dip in quality in the food since zomato/swiggy have become mainstream.

Earlier, all the curries used to have their unique flavor and taste. Now it feels like they just have one big tub of curry and they just add the stuff you've ordered. So mushroom masala tastes EXACTLY the same as Butter Paneer masala, just with Paneer instead of Mushroom. 

Even the most premium restaurant available on these platforms in my area has same tasting food whenever you order. It's slowly getting so annoying that my lazy ass rather prefer to cook my food myself Looks like Swiggy/Uber bullshit has hit both the restaurant business and the delivery business equally well. 

1. A friend got his food delivered in a la carte style : A Swiggy delivery executive shows up, puts his hand into the cloth bag which the restaurant gave, proceeds to hand my friend the items that were in it and leaves with the cloth bag.

2. Uber executive calls my friend, tells her that he cannot find her house because his GPRS(?) is not working. She helps him navigate, and while at it, he runs out of petrol. At this point, he is 200m away from her place. He keeps saying random stuff and pretends as though he is not understanding where he is. He refuses to ask the people passing by, for help. At the end he abuses her and asks here to come to him to get the food. Uber refused to refund her the money, stating the reason as ""unable to contact the customer"". Yeah. Remember going to a Punjabi restaurant in Bandra since 2007. Visited there this year after a gap of four years and it has actually way worse off than before. Food seemed hastily cooked and the waiters just literally wanted you the eat and gtfo and there was a line of delivery guys outside. [deleted] The good restaurants I like don't do online delivery in the first place That is true .. reason behind is earlier, business was simple .. the raw material and prepration cost was needed to be calculated with price to get an idea of decent profit .. now swiggy etc take away nearly 28 %  off per order so they have to adjust the quality and quantity to maintain the same profit.   Eventually they apply same formula all across.   Basically what they're doing is scrapping off the gone 28% from regular direct customers .. so quality has been degraded all over .. Where I stay, good quality restaurants prefer to 'switch off' Swiggy/Zomato/etc. whenever there is heavy load. They are just not listed on Swiggy at that particular time. They prefer to serve their dine-in customers first.

Also, in situations like now the rainy season, Swiggy gives the order to the restaurant, but is unable to find the delivery executive at the right time, leading to cancellation of orders due to very long delay times. This causes a loss for everyone. I have seen lots of conversations on restauranteur groups where the owners are cribbing about the tight corners caused by these services. Have seen sizeable reduction in dining area in few of the hotels nearby here in Bangalore A restaurant near me has the opposite situation. When i ate the food there it felt more fresh compared to orders plus the quantity was more too, they were also offering discounts for dining there and takeouts.

Though this varies from restaurant to restaurant. True for a lot of places, Multiple factors to it. 
1. Scale - Earlier a restaurant was service a fixed number of meals at any given time depending on their seating and popularity of take aways. Now the same kitchen is also service a much larger number of online orders, quality is going to take a hit with this increase in volume.
2. Margins - with the delivery apps taking a large cut as commission the margins are lower, restaurants have to cut down costs to get similar profit.
3. Focus - Earlier restaurant business was driven by ensuring customers come back because the Customer base was smaller. Food needs to be good, ambience need to be good, prices should be right, otherwise the customer is not coming back and you are losing business. With online deliveries driving a larger portion of revenue they don't care much. Also, unlike dining out, which is an experience thing, ordering from home is more of a convenience thing. Nah.
I don't think the quality has worsened noticably.

I don't order a whole lot but the places I order from I used to frequent before. I don't see a change in flavour or quality. Maybe it's just the places I order and not a large sample size. I had the same thought !! 
Restaurants are not giving a single fuck about the taste , they're just selling food to fill the stomach. No regards are given to the taste Also seen a major price hike in many places. A local sandwich shop used to give a pizza sandwich for 50. Now it's 120. I guess the publicity from Swiggy increased the demand to an extent that they found it necessary to hike their prices by over a 100%. My place there is no swiggy but the restuarants are top class. I have never ordered food via Zomato/swiggy and i will never do. They're changing how you eat, outsourcing cooking. One of many perks of living in India is that food is cheap if you cook yourself. Now this is gone too, now a big chunk of your paycheck is going into buying cooked food. 

I cook my own food and I'll continue to do this. Occasionally i go eat out in a fancy restaurant because i like this experience. That's it. This ordering food lifestyle may suit Americans but it'll certainly not suit Indians in the long run. Wake up.",Food,2019-08-05 09:12:56

"Indians who've been to other countries: How would you describe the taste of food at other places like Italy, China, USA, etc. Did you have problems adjusting to their food or was it different but good?",22,cec6vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cec6vt/indians_whove_been_to_other_countries_how_would/,19,"I see food vloggers and tv shows talking about food from other places but I wonder how it tastes when the food is cooked without spices and marinates and seasoned very lightly with nothing more than salt,pepper and raw herbs. 

Was it easy for you to adjust according to the food preferences prevalent in these places or did you have to find indian restaurants or cook your own food to feel satisfied.  

My main question is wether a person, who has eaten authentic north Indian food all his life , can enjoy dishes made with minimal seasoning and completely different cooking styles?",MGsquare," From my experience I can talk about Italy.

Italian food focuses on fresh and high quality ingredients. A lot of dishes are created with few and relatively simple ingredients. Some things that are commonly eaten: Salad with only olive oil and balsamic vinegar or even bread with olive oil and salt. If you can do it with extra virgin olive oil, even better.

The food in general in Italy is amazing where ever you go, every region has its own version of the same dish. You have to get used to it though. At the beginning it might seem bland, but slowly you start tasting individual ingredients and it gets better then.

Indian restaurants here are not so good. So every time I feel like eating something spicy I eat a pizza/pasta with nduja (spicy pork) or just manage to cook something at home. US - I've been to Texas. The local food here is mostly Tex-Mex or Mexican and it isn't really far off from Indian spicy food. The other american food suggested by the people were mostly what you consider junk food here - pizza, burgers. Then there are english breakfast stuff - bacon, sausage, pancakes etc. In my two weeks there, I did not go to any Indian restaurants or homes of any Indians and I didn't miss the Indian food at all. In fact, it felt like I was in India but eating only restaurant food and non Indian cuisine.  
  
UK - Again 2 weeks in London. The breakfast options are the same as what you get here, but apart from that it's all fish and chips. Every other english food item (except dessert) I tried was plain bland. But London being a big city and all options available, I tried other cuisines and so I could manage. Also, pizza and burgers are readily available. I didn't go to any Indian places though. If I had to go to some small town where there aren't any Indian/Asian/Mexican restaurants, it would've been a struggle. Fish and chips would be available, but the fish is like boiled fish.  Also, london is expensive as fuck. Never going there again unless someone else pays my bills. Recently ate Singaporean stuff like laksa along with some Japanese stuff.its tolerable but yeah your spice intake will be reduced compared to Indian ones. Indonesian food is also very rich in spices. Even the fried rice is excellent. Try googling for Nasi Gudeg, Egg Balado, Sate with peanut sauce, Soto Ayam, Ikam Bakar Kecap Manis. Usually they also serve sambals, which are kind if like chutneys, but I like them more. I stead of pappadums, they have krupuk, of which krupuk udang( shrimp crackers) is my favourite. A good Kang Kung hitokaye or some capcay make good vegetables. Generally, Indonesian food is great, but the dessert scene is still lacking compared to India. 

Vietnamese Pho is something I truly enjoy. It has all the delicacy of Ramen, with less salt and more lemongrass. I liked it the moment I smelled it. 

American food was honestly a bit disappointing for me. Most of it was just uncooked salad or grilled steaks, hamburgers etc. or stuff like Mac n Cheese which I dislike. Food from Louisiana, especially Cajun and Creole dishes were very enjoyable though. I suspect there is a lot left I haven’t experienced. 

Caribbean food is delicious, but a bit limited in range. It can be just as spicy as Indian food, but it feels more wholesome. Jerk chicken is a dream. Food from South America, especially tacos and burritos and salsa were also to my taste, and they are very popular in the US. Cuban food is great. I wish our lentil curries tasted that good. 

British food was disappointing. Fish n Chips were ok at best. Generally I found they dishes from the rest of Europe was commonly found in the UK. Hungarian Goulash tasted good. The Brits are fairly good at baked desserts though, especially cakes and puddings. Sticky toffee pudding is good. 

I dislike almost all Chinese food I have tried save a few Sichuan dishes, mainly Mapo Tofu, Twice cooked pork, meatballs, cooked duck and some dim sum. Honestly the smell itself is sometimes a problem. Maybe, as you ask, if I tried going to China, I might change my opinion. I went to US an tried their food.It's not  with spices like ours. I can describe it as raw. Most westerners eat their food raw. The sweets are pretty good.  If you go to the restaurants you will be surprised as you pay lot of money for little food. At the end of the day there's nothing good as our own Indian style Living in US and been to Italy, France, Belgium and Netherlands.

US: You get everything here, by everything I dont mean Indian. I mean it taste wise. If you open up to eating all sorts of meats, then you have ample choice of good spicy cuisines. Mexican and Thai food can surprise you with the kind of spices they used, they are super hot (In US Hot is Teekha not garam). 

Italy: They know how to use spices, but not salt, if you add a little bit of salt to the dishes you are fine and I loved the food. Especially try their coastal food its Yum!

France: I only liked the bakery items, not that the food is bad, but ordering the right thing may take some efforts as they are not very friendly with English. However I must agree they use a very little to no exotic spices. Blant very blant food. 

Belgium: Again since they have a heavy influence of France, there food is similar but they have some good dishes which an Indian would love for the spices (again need to be open for many meat choices ).

Netherlands: Lovely culture and food and you can easily love their food being from any part of the planet. Burgers, sandwiches and salads mainly but super tasty.

&#x200B;

All I would say is  open up to all the choices, food is food ! And there are passionate people making it, keep your beliefs aside and try it! Canada -

There is plenty of Indian food here, Toronto has a huge Indian population and you will be easily accommodated. Even in smaller cities, there are still plenty of Immigrants pretty much wherever you go. Man, get out of your comfort zone. I presume you are still in your 20s. This is the best time to move around. Once you are married there are a bunch load of problems moving around. Why don't you go aboard? Apply for a Phd or something?

Pls help regarding indian food.,60,by5409,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/by5409/my_dad_has_diabetes_pls_help_regarding_indian_food/,91,"My dad(62)has diabetes for almost 16 years now. Inspite of making no strict dietary changes his blood sugar was normal for almost those entire period except for the last 1 year. I want him to make healthy & better choices from now on but could not find huge variety of indian foods suitable for an diabetic which also meet his daily calorie intake. Pls suggest foods that you know of. Thank you.

My findings till now: egg, milk, lean meat, fish, veggies, chickpeas, soya products,nuts, beans",Geno_and_Pheno," Dad had diabetes. What helped him was exercise. One hour of exercise everyday. Do add that to the list. I have a slightly different question. My dad(and his sister and his dad) has diabetes(Type 2, detected after 45). My mom doesn't have diabetes but her mother(my grandma) had it. Therefore, my genes are full of diabetic dispositions. How do I minimize my chances of getting afflicted with diabetes? The amount of misinformation spread in this thread regarding diabetes amazes me. Please don't treat diabetes as a causal condition. It is indeed life altering. If you are in big city, get a diet chart from dietitian. I'm in the same boat basically. My mom and dad both had diabetes and I'm on a high risk as well. 

Well I'll tell you some stuff. This advice goes to anyone looking to live a healthy lifestyle and avoiding diabetes.

1) Do Intermittent fasting. Watch Dr Eric Berg's videos on YouTube on that topic. Basically what you wanna do is keep the insulin levels as low as possible to avoid being insulin resistant which leads to diabetes. Plus IF has numerous benefits.

2) Exercise is the best medicine. Doesn't matter what kind. No brainer.

3) Sugar is evil, I don't eat even a tiny bit. Sugar doesn't mean only sugary stuff it also means things high in carbs/glucose (rice). Search about glycemic index and why it's important. So eat right. Search ketogenic diet.

4) Keeping stress levels low, stress is related to all kinds of illnesses. 

5) Related to point number 1, don't eat too frequently in a day. Every time you eat you spike up your insulin levels and it's bad if your insulin spikes regularly causing insulin resistance so try eating twice a day. I eat twice a day once at 12pm and at 8pm followed by 16 hours of fasting. I've lost most of my belly fat, corrected my insulin resistance and I haven't felt so much better in a long time, all my symptoms of pre diabetes are gone. 


Intermittent fasting doesn't mean that you're 'fasting'. You can still eat any amount of food you want but only in a given time window. 

Research about these things and good luck! r/desiketo My father was diagnosed with diabetes at age 46 and exercise was the miracle cure for him. His diabetes was still in early stages when I made him join a gym and quit all sugary/junk food. In 6 months his sugar levels went from 600 to 90 and that level's been consistent even after 2 years. I guess what helped him the most was that we started early and didn't let it get worse. 

Even tho his sugar levels are not high anymore, we still don't allow him sugar. For tea he only drinks green tea or black tea, we don't add too much ghee or butter to his diet because of high carbs, no more junk food and regular exercise. Altho you need to find what works the best for your father because everyone's different. Check out intermittent fasting. I've read it can reverse even type 2 diabetes.

Google about it and read more on its sub - r/intermittentfasting My father had diabetes since his early 40s and was able to keep it under control till his legs began to trouble him in his late 70s. He walked for 45mins every day whether it rained or it was freezing. Also he followed a strict diet of no sugar, no potatoes and very small amount of rice. Exercise and diet control is only help. [deleted] Stop eating carbs and it should all be fine My mom and dad both have diabetes and after the changes they made they feel younger, fitter, and healthier than ever. 

1. Exercise. Daily exercise is extremely important. Minimum 1hr everyday. Brisk walk is good. 

2. Diet. I can't comment about non-veg food because we are vegetarians but they made 2 massive changes. Learn that everything white is poison. Cut out white rice, wheat, sugar and salt. They replaced it with Millets. So they now make Jowar/Bajra Rotis or instead of wheat rotis, and use Millet rice instead of white rice. [The Millet Table](https://www.millettable.com) has a lot of recipes to teach you how to use millets. 

3. Don't abandon sweets or you'll have cravings you'll give in to it and gorge on it. The best diet is the one you can maintain. So make sweets ocassionally but slowly reduce sugar and substitute with Palm Sugar, jaggery, etc. 

Ear more vegetables. So make 2 sabjis everyday instead of one. Fill up using vegetables instead of carbs Loosing weight is must. Find the ideal BMI for his age group and stay close to it. Belly fat is most dangerous. Being diabetic means excess pressure on kidneys and liver which can also affect the heart. Processed foods are a no go. Find a meal plan and stick to it. No cheat days. Prepare your meals early if you know there are going to be plans. Strict regiment diet and exercise is the key, nothing else. I wouldn't recommend a very low carb diet as our body needs energy to function. Just find healthier alternatives. Any product with low ' glycemic index ' will work(GI around 55). [Have a look](http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/understanding-carbohydrates/glycemic-index-and-diabetes.html).

Some examples-Jwar,Bajra,Oatmeal. Type 2 Diabetic here. Went from 126 mg/mL to 93 mg/mL sugar levels in 3 months.

In veggies choose vegetables that your father can eat without getting gassy. 

Soya products totally out.

Milk totally out. 

Meat doesn't need to be and shouldn't be lean. Use fatty cuts. 

Remove beans completely if it makes your father gassy. 

Look more for portion control and carb quality than choosing the carb content.

Ten minute walk after each meal. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. 

2 eggs a day. The choline in egg yolks will help control blood sugar.

Supplement vitamin D3. Do LowCarb.

If he's T2D consider Keto. Follow youtube channels like eric berg and beat diabetes. Overtime if you do not make dietary changes the baseline sugar level increases making it difficult to control blood sugar. At his age their needs to be a strict monitoring of carbohydrate consumption otherwise complications can arise Might wanna try intermittent fasting or low carb diets. Do your research before Please please please spend time researching what I'm saying below. 

This stuff really works.

Get the book called The Diabetes Code by Dr. Jason Fung.

Immediately cut out soy products, LEAN meat.

Remove all vegetable/seed oils - sunflower oil, canola oil, etc. (all omega-6 rich, which is bad).

Only oil that's suitable for India, mostly - unrefined coconut oil (omega-3 rich).

Look up Jason Fung's talks on intermittent fasting on YT.

Look up Eric Berg on Youtube.

Look up Satchin Panda's interviews/lectures on YouTube, and learn about Time Restricted Eating.

Finally, read a few things from dietdoctor dot com's news/blog section.


Exercise WILL NOT CURE AILMENTS. It's good to generally exercise but it isn't a cure to anything, not even weight loss.

Check out Jackfruit 365 products on Amazon or their videos on YouTube.

As much as the world of medicine would like you to believe it's a persistent, chronic, worsening disease, IT ISN'T! I am not an expert here, but oatmeal is also good for diabetes. Just don’t go for masala or any spiced oats. 
Just plain and simple oat is good. You DM me.

yaad se. Basically anything that is keto friendly will keep his diabetes under control. My mom could go off her diabetes meds following keto. But she had to start taking them after she stopped following it. Do mind this is for type 2 diabetes. It's lethal for someone with type 1 diabetes. About food, best is javaari ki roti. Sabji must not be too spicy and must have good water content. Less sugar. My father too has diabetes but is in control. And regular exercise is a must Cut down sugar and alcohol. Also track calories (eg. with myfitnesspal) and avoid overeating. For your dad 2000 calories per day should be plenty.",Food,2019-06-08 14:32:27

How to solve stray dog/cattle problem in Indian cities?,21,cy8tlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cy8tlf/how_to_solve_stray_dogcattle_problem_in_indian/,22,"If I'm not wrong, many cities see multiple traumatic injuries, accidents and even deaths every day due to this menace.

The problem of stray dogs is mostly that of breeding and garbage, both seem very hard to solve if left to the government.  Is it even practical to sterilize all stray dogs?

The problem of stray cattle is mostly due to old cattle being an economic burden but not led to a butcher house because of cultural and legal issues around cows. There are rarely any stray buffaloes. 

Has there been any debate in any significant municipal, state or central forum?",drollbat," Sterilization would be the most humane method but I've personally witnessed the incompetency of officials in this regard.The one other viable option would me mass euthanasia, which won't sit well with a large percentage of the population. Any debate and it will be immediately quashed by the animal lovers. Make India like Texas I strongly agree with you. But as the others have pointed out animal lovers will quash any debate on this topic.

Its lunacy to the max. I think India is the only country I have been to where animals are treated so poorly in the name of protecting/loving them. Would there be lots of rats if there were no dogs? Everybody has spoken about dogs let's talk about cattle. 

Dogs need to be sterilized period.

I being a vegan studied a bit on this subject. Dairy farmers sometimes have no clue what to do with infertile or males cattle so they just leave them on streets. Since nobody can trace which dairy farmer left his cattle behind they run scot free. 


And please stop being jerks and treating cows like use and throw material. Its humans greed which leads to animal factory farming for no reason. Just because cows can't talk and hire lawyer people think its okay to slaughter them. 

The biggest problem is humans who create trash. They could minimize trash but no they have to use and throw cups, order food then waste the same food take everything for granted and then blame poor animals which are doing their best for survival. the gun laws here make it worse.",Food,2019-09-01 19:27:24
Who do you think is right in #LogOut campaign? Zomato or Restaurant owners?,27,cuouln,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cuouln/who_do_you_think_is_right_in_logout_campaign/,39,"The #LogOut campaign has been raising eyebrows as the uprising of restaurants against food aggregators who are technically not bound by what restaurants on their platforms say. More on the campaign [here](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/restaurants-decide-to-pull-out-of-dining-apps-that-offer-deals-1565792728714.html)

So for those who haven't heard about it, the restaurants via their association ""National Restaurants Association of India""(NRAI) have broadly faced following issues.

1) The zomato gold deep discounting system is hurting their business since people misuse it by for example, on a weekend, get 1+1 on drinks at one place and then grab 1+1 on food at another place. This unarguably has hut the owner's pockets

2) Lack of transparency from Zomato on their rating system and the fact that Zomato provide details of customers using which Restaurants can build a loyal customer base.

3) Large chains like Domino's and McD are able to negotiate huge bargain on commissions(7-8%) while small restaurants have to agree to around 20-25% to even be visible on the platform. This doesn't include the hefty advertising fee. Hence, no uniform policy and systematic abuse of MSME eateries.

Now, these may seem like business decisions on part of Zomato to become profitable. Still, they have agreed to tweak Gold program, rather unfairly to us as customers. More on that [here](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/zomato-rejigs-gold-service-to-benefit-restaurants-ceo-1566402560626.html)

Yesterday, Zomato Co-founder and CEO engaged in below the belt fights and said they were done with this campaign.

So, who do you think is right in their stand?

Edit: My apologies I wont be able to reply anyone on here since I've been banned, but thanks for having the convo!",deludedDudes," When Zomato Gold was introduced, participating restaurants were told it would be an exclusive platform for a select few to grow their footfall. In about 6 months that changed and now any Tom, Dick & Harry can sign up. They also changed the rules for customers who signed up for unlimited unlocks, but are now limited to 1 a day. Amidst this fiasco, they've also increased the membership price of Gold by 50%.

Zomato charges the merchant 20k per annum, and the customer 1,800 per annum in return for what? For a separate list in the app and minor tweaks where you get a Gold logo. No part of the kitty is given to the merchant, who is paying Zomato to join what used to be an exclusive club _and_ giving away freebies.

IMHO one of the real scoundrels here that's getting away is Swiggy. Swiggy has been running discount campaigns for several months in India under the moniker ""Swiggy It"". The customer gets a 30-60% discount on every order, for which the restaurant is charged a flat fee. What customers don't realise is that the flat fee is often times more than the discount that they're receiving. Let me give you an example:

I run a cloud kitchen that was offering a 20% discount on all orders with no max discount (aka discount cap). So if a customer ordered worth 1k, they'd receive a discount of Rs 200 and both parties were happy since the order value went up proportionately to the discount.

Then came their predatory ""swiggyit"" campaign, where my restaurant had to pay Rs 87 + tax for the customer to get a discount worth (upto) Rs 100. The tax is now being paid because Swiggy has positioned the discount as a ""growth pack"" and restaurants are technically purchasing a product from Swiggy for every order. So 87 + 18% GST is about Rs 103. And at the end of it, the customer's discount is capped at Rs 100, and many times he doesn't even receive the full cap value of the discount because it's a percentage of the order total.

The real clincher is that an order would have to be worth Rs 500 if the customer was to receive a discount of Rs 100 under our old promotion. Instead, now the customer gets a lower discount and we get charged more for every single order than the customer will ever receive in discount value.

Oh, and Swiggy can claim the 18% GST in input tax credit whereas restaurants can't.

If you don't sign up for this discount campaign, you get pushed so far down in the listings that nobody will ever see you, seriously maiming visibility and discoverability.

For anyone defending Zomato or Swiggy or UberEats, I invite you to try running a restaurant. In fact, try running even a delivery kitchen, which involves lesser startup costs, operational overheads, and is overall a leaner outfit. It's not as easy as it looks from the outside. If restros cant shy away from pricing a humble neebupani at 150, paratha at 100+. I stand with zomato. ""Food doesn't have a religion. It is a *business*."" Schemes like Zomato Gold were never going to be sustainable in a low trust society like India Amazon is coming Bois... Who does Zomato Gold and Infinity and other things benefit?  
  
- Users - Discounts. More food for lesser money.  
  
- Zomato - Money from users, commission from the restaurants per order  
  
- Restaurants - More customers, but losses per customer per order.   
  
What am I missing? If nothing, there's no reason why Restaurants should be on/with zomato. Related link:
https://theprint.in/economy/how-zomato-went-from-food-industry-fairytale-to-evil-corporation/279592/ i remember posting a big post here almost everyone thought i was overreacting today how the tables have turned 

so lets analyze whats wrong 

1) ***deep discounts*** of which the restaurant bares 35-40 percent and the company the rest the problem is if you order worth 300 and give a discount of even 30 percent the restaurant pays 90 rupees and the company caps the discount at 90 so they didn't end up paying the rest of the percentage the customer would not care if he didnt get the 10 rupppes lesser since he already got 90 rupees off 

***2) no self delivery-*** the company no longer allows self delivery the percentage charged for my outlet is 17 because i signed it a while ago today they dont wanna take on anyone for lesser than 30 percent per order . At least let us deliver our food so that our commissions can be less 

***3)zom gold*** \- recently a friend took us to a pub and for 4 beers we payed 600 which is ridiculous had i bought it from the wine shop it would have cost me 500 how will you as a person run your pub on 100 rupees ? im not mentioning the sign up fees etc 

***4) bad service -*** never in all these years did we face a problem of delivery boys eating the customers food . even when a order is cancelled i never receive  my food back . account managers not answering calls going on random vacations and the service center is just abysmal 

&#x200B;

overall zomato needs to behave I personally think this is a healthy campaign. The Food Aggregator Apps are still at a nascent stage. And we all know how startups can be aggressive for them to be to be successful. So right now, they are probably bullying the restaurants. And now these restaurant associations have woken up and fighting back. This is nothing but market forces at play. Soon, the market would mature and all the stakeholders would reach a point of understanding where everyone gets benefited. These are natural events in a free market and let's not paint someone bad or good here.",Food,2019-08-24 12:19:17

The Kebab Factory in Radisson.

Benares Club has okay food. If you are near Lanka(BHU) area, go to Ravidas Gate and ask for Pehelwan Shop for some authentic lassi. There are 4(3+1) shops there by the same name. Choose the 1 shop. You'll know which is the (1) I am talking about. It will cost you about 40-50 for the large cup. 

Near the Ravidas Gate, ask for 'Keshav Tambol Bhandar'. It is hardly 40-50 m from Pehelwan. Have some really nice meetha paan costing about 20. Enjoy the moment when it melts inside your mouth.

Just opposote to (3)Pehelwans, there is a small sweetshop. Not in the best condition, but it serves a really nice and sweet 'Launglatta'. If you have trouble finding it, ask someone for Khandelwal Vastralay. The sweetshop is just opposite to it.

Between the stretch of road which connects Ravidas Gate and BHU gate, there is a food truck that serves some really nice Faluda and  ice cream. In the same street, there is a small and dilapidated coffee shop which serces you coffee in a kulhad for Rs. 20. I always have it when I am in that area.

Having Diarrhoea while travelling would be worst than watching RGV ki Aag Haven't done that in a very long time but I can tell you how.

Sleep at railway station (dormitories are quite cheap 50/10 rupees, else you can sleep in waiting rooms). Every decent railway station has a waiting room with toilet and bath. Most tourist places also have Sulabh with toilets and baths but cleanliness varies.

Most places outside railway and bus stations have very cheap food options. Make sure to walk a little outside as those inside and adjoining are bit costly due to location. Focus on heavy filling food like Chole Bhature, Rajma Chawal, dal roti, parathe or whatever local cuisine is available from stalls not dhabas. Any food joint with a place to sit is costly compared to movable stalls. Pack food and water when traveling to touristy places as its quite costly there.

Since you will be walking and traveling in local transport, dont worry about healthy food.

I did'nt shared the reports which were normal.

The 3rd day in the hospital- She saw my reports and her words were the same 'admit kar wa do jaundice hai'. So after one day I got admitted on sunday. There was AC and TV in the room that made me smile. No one else except me cared for the TV. So, on the first they took some blood and started   
supplying some fluid medicine through the injection that was implanted on my right hand. On the bottles it was written NS and DNS they also supplied fluid. The next day 6 of my school friends came to me.The days went on and they supplied medicine injected medicines through  injection and gave some tablets. One day 2 or 3 doctor's cane and said that Dengue NS1was positive in the report So they took some blood for platelets count and it was normal. After 5 days of my life at hospital I was discharged and given some medicines and a revisit after 5 days. In these 5 days there was swelling  in the corners of my mouth. So , again went to the doctor, this time it was mumps another blood infection she again gave some medicines some blood reports and a revisit after 5 days. Mumps disappeared in two days. She also took some some blood for LFT,CBC

This time the concern is my platelets had incresed to 480   which should be in range of 163 - 369.

Please help me ,this is concerning me.
Thanks for any help.",KuShAgRa016," Dude. Your direct Bilirubin is elevated. Something is wrong with your liver. Id suggest you to go to a Medical Gastroenterologist. (DM). Don’t go to a General physician. That’s my advice to you. I’m a doctor FYI. Hepatitis Listen dear. I know its bad so bad. But don't think so much. I know its difficult but you've to keep calm. This is just bad time. You've got your body very weak so you've to extreamly take care of yourself. You will be alright very soon. And as much as I know delhi has a bad climate because of pollution and all ald the weather is dangerous. You just be calm and take care everything eill be weln and good soon. Wishes from my side! You probably have some infective hepatitis. Maybe A or E. Highly unlikely its a hemolytic condition as the direct bilirubin is elevated, not indirect. If it is hepatitis, it should resolve on its own in about 3 weeks. It has no definite treatment. Just eat nutritious food and take conservative treatment
A 3rd yr mbbs student btw Go to another doctor. check any other doctor Go to ILBS Hey, doctor from Mumbai here. Firstly, get a second opinion. Your direct bilirubin is too high,. there's something definitely wrong with your liver so I think you should see a gastroenterologist. It could possibly be Hepatitis but I cannot say anything for sure. Your sodium levels are not too disturbing. Best advice I can give over long distance is to take a second opinion with a specialist if you don't get better in a day at most. May I ask do you consume alcohol? If yes, how much per day, how many days in a week and when. Secondly, were you on any medication when the problem started? Is there blood in your urine/stool or is your vomit dark brown in colour? Do you have any rash on your skin, especially look out for one with little purple dots. Take care, Reddit is there with you",Food,2019-09-01 02:29:24
Unpopular Opinion/CMV: Removing stray dogs will increase stray cats which are far worse to the environment.,27,cry16e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cry16e/unpopular_opinioncmv_removing_stray_dogs_will/,27,"I admit I like dogs but I do not feed or care for the strays. But if dogs are beggars, cats are choosing-beggars. I have seen in SEA countries where dogs were removed from cities and now the cities are infested with cats. 

Cats hunt arbitrarily and they hunt in pack. They'll kill birds, squirrels, owls, crows,destroy plants just because they can do it. They also carry rabies and the mind-control disease Toxoplasmosis(fatal with HIV). Cats have no understanding of boundaries and trespass into anyone's home and bite open food, kill lizards or pets just for the fun of it. 

Adam Ruins Everything has a skit on it :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpAFpwDVBJQ

Dogs were bred to be compassionate and is not as destructive. Sure few are crazy. I don't have a solution to this mess but I know talking about removing them is very very myopic.",dbejsfau," I seem to be the only one who isn't puzzled by how exactly will the population of cats increase when stray dogs are taken care of. It's not like they have a direct competition for resources/survival. In a Pune (Pimpri) apartment recently, a stray dog bit a little girl's leg who soon died instantly on the spot. The girl's father started a campaign to remove stray dogs from the area and I don't think his is wrong. Such incidents are becoming quite common in big cities but I'm yet to hear a stray cat attacking anyone yet. First of all, there's no proof that toxoplasmosis is a ""mind control disease"", there are some studies going on which link toxoplasmosis to certain mental illnesses, but nothing has been proved yet. TP is mostly asymptotic, but can develop seriousl conditions in people with impaired immunity like HIV, as you mentioned. Wikipedia says almost 50% of world's population carry the parasite. So, if indeed it was a ""mind controlling parasite"", then we can very well conclude that the toxoplasmosis parasite is basically running the world!!

&#x200B;

Secondly, ""removing"" dogs/cats is never the option, the best method is population control by neutering/spaying. But this is expensive and that's why municipal corporations are loathe to spend the money when they can just cull the animals. A lot of people and NGOs end up doing this out of their own pockets. My girlfriend personally pays for neutering and treating all her neighborhood dogs & also raises funds in the college where she teaches to look after the dogs that reside in the college premises. I sometimes help her out with this, and believe me it is not an easy job for common people to do! One of her college dogs had got distemper and had to be put down. Then we had to go an disinfect the whole college premises and vaccinate every stray dog there. Without municipal help, the costs are often too exorbitant to do what we want to do. But still a lot of people try. There's a guy we know who runs his own NGO to look after stray dogs. He takes in any disable dogs he comes across and looks after them.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, just like humans all animals are unpredictable and can have fits of rage or mood swings, we need to respect all of them. When I was a child, I used to be very scared of dogs, I would try and avoid streets where I knew stray dogs loiter. In my attempts to steer clear of them, I often tried to run away and ended up being chased!! But as I grew up, I learned to treat them with respect as I would do a human, and as a result I have become more friendly towards them, and they towards me.

&#x200B;

I had a classmate long time back who was attacked by her own pet dog who had developed some kind of a disease. Her dog bit her in the face and left her disfigured for life, but this did not affect her love for animals at all. She told me that she was still sad and cried after her pet dog was put down due to the disease. I don't think stray dog population and stray cat population is related in that way, you seem to assume that they are negatively correlated, but like you said, dogs are more compassionate, they don't really kill much, certainly not stray cats which can be ferocious, removing stray dogs or not, there will be little impact on stray cats.

Having stray dog is indeed a problem, so is having stray cats, don't think of excuses to avoid solving a problem, like I can't say congested cities should not develop metro systems because constructing metro systems is costly and without metro systems people can also ride bikes which is a healthier lifestyle. Just spay and neuter them, and let them be We can just sterlize dogs to control their population because frankly speaking their population is out of control and in the neighbourhood they bark at random people, sometimes even bite kids, etc so something needs to be done. [deleted] As someone who's very affectionate towards animals and also recognises the fact that population explosion leads to problems, I'd say both animals have different challenges and I don't know who's better or worse.

Dogs are much more affectionate and understanding towards humans in general but they are a greater challenge in terms of threat from attacks and rabies. They are much more dangerous when in packs.

Cats are comparatively shy and even difficult to spot. Cat bites and attacks are significantly lesser. However my colony has had a cat explosion lately because of which I know their issues. They have the habit of pooping outside people's homes. As you mentioned, they don't recognize boundaries. Cleaning that is a task in itself and they don't even get deterred away easily. Second, they reproduce much faster. A cat can give birth to 12 kittens in an year. >Cats hunt arbitrarily.

Not true.  Wild or semi-wild animals hunt for food only.  What is your source for this statement?


> They also carry rabies and the mind-control disease Toxoplasmosis(fatal with HIV). 

Not limited to stray cats.  What is your source for this statement?
 

> Cats have no understanding of boundaries 

This is an absurd statement. Cats are territorial and their territory can be large.  No animal has the ""human"" concept for boundaries. What is your source for this statement?

I like both cats and dogs.  Please don't let your admitted liking for dogs color your thinking. [deleted]",Food,2019-08-18 14:53:17

Is it acceptable for chefs to use bare hands while cooking?

Aren't there tools to replace hands for Indian food preparation? For example - mixer to ""goond"" aata instead of hands. When you absolutely have to use hands (for example to marinate) - aren't there gloves to use instead? I realize this cannot be expected from small establishments, but was genuinely shocked to see it at a 5 star ITC hotel.",heeyyyyyy," Do they use gloves while cooking at your home? Just curious. Ever seen Jamie Oliver or Gordon Ramsay or Bobby Flay or Marco Pierre cook or bake stuff wearing gloves , Chef's do wash their ✋ s  and maintain the required hygienic standards , wearing gloves and cooking will just be an hindrance , especially when it comes to cooking Indian food .. Yes, if chef is not suffering from any contagious disease and has washed his/her hands, it is perfectly safe (actually even better) to use bare hands while cooking.

Read this one about [sushi](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/scott-rosenberg-gloves-fight-sushi-article-1.2426365). Eh, no. Where did you get the idea? Food has been prepared by hand all over the world since forever. Cooking kills all germs so it does not matter one bit. Small pieces of hair pass through your body harmlessly so no need to worry.

I'm looking for some meal prep ideas for Indian food. So far I've got these cubed andhra masala in my freezer that I use for making chicken without much hassle! Have you guys got any so far for? 

Here's what I've been thinking: 

\-- chopping up onions and grinding them to a paste and freezing them into cubes

\-- make some gravy bases in bulk - i.e. I love the mughlai so I'm planning to make this and then freezing them into cubes and storing

\-- readymade upma mixes that you just add water to and heat in microwave for 3-5 mins

&#x200B;

Do you guys have some tips & tricks that you use to make healthy, tasty food?",burgundyColor," Instead of puréed onions, freeze onions that have been browned. Makes things quicker as frying onions is the longest part of most curry bases. You can also freeze chopped herbs in a bit of oil in ice-cube trays to make anything taste fresh. Also boil daals and freeze in portions. All you need to do is a tadka and reheat. Invest in a rice cooker. 10 minutes for fresh rice and you don't have to tend to it. You can also make pulao by sauteing onions and spices and chucking it in the rice cooker with the rice. Just don't put peas or beans in till the end. I don't think you're saving a lot of prep by freezing chopped uncooked onions. You can get one of those onion chopper things to save time chopping onions. Not Indian food but it helps me save time:
 3-4 scoops of oats + 3spoons boutnvita initially and blend.

 Then add 1/4th cup milk blend. 

Add peanut butter and banana (+nutella if not heath conscious) blend. 

Add 3/4th milk blend.

My mother is a housewife with two kids (me and my little brother). I work as a backend developer in Gurgaon while my brother is in 11th standard right now. My parents and my bro are settled in Hyderabad. 

Mom doesn't have a great educational background (B Com. dropout years ago and poor fluency in English). She always talks about wanting her own source of income like starting a small canteen or getting a job or something like that. 

My father quit his job a few years ago and earns a 50k pension. He is trying to setup some business and has blown all his savings on it and has huge debts from some relatives including me. He is also a major self-centered prick who doesn't seem to care too much about my mom and always discourages her...which btw I think is one of the biggest reasons why my mom wants to earn for her own.

I have already suggested her to get started with some English classes because she'll probably have a lot more options once she's fluent in it. Do you guys have any idea how I can help her get some income for herself? What jobs do housewives usually do which doesn't require a great educational background or too much of a time investment but gets some decent pay? Even better if it she can do it from the comfort of home.

Thanks folks!",PrettierDrogba," A home cooked tiffin service?
Baby sitting kids?
Educating nursery/Kindergarten kids? Baking.  Cakes will always be in demand. Let her attend some classes and learn the skills.

Home cooked food. Depending on the location and logistics, she can earn well. If she is good with cooking , ask her to join Tin men. It's a new startup in Hyderabad which does delivery of home made food.

You just have to put all types of food she prepares. Users can order on daily basis or monthly basis.

It's just like Zomato or Uber eats but instead of delivering food from hotels and restaurants they deliver food from home.

In Hyderabad lots of people use Tin men and subscribe food on monthly basis, so it could help her make some money. Hyderabad - Food sells easily. Location in Hyderabad? also post on /r/hyderabad Learning English will be a good skill, but don't think that will land her a job. In her age it's better to play your strengths rather than learning something new,  which let's face it, every damn graduate has done and is better than her. Why would anyone hire a 48 year old woman when they can hire a fresh face 20-21 year old?

As others have stated cooking food is the best way she can get income out of something she has been doing for decades. It's great that you have a start-up available in the city that specifically caters to that niche. Help her get some equipment that will cut down on the prep time. She can get started in no time.

Bear in mind there are no free lunches, people have to work hard to get money, if there were jobs which paid good and could be done in the comfort of people's own homes with little to no investment of time or labour, then every one would be doing it. IMO, food is a good low-risk business and also builds you a loyal network of clients who may be interested in any future ventures.

These people started from one house in Blore and now do good business from 2-3 outlets around the city. However, it is a time investment if it becomes too successful. TINMEN - Home cooked food just register in the website , they will come and take the food from your home and deliver it to customers . There might be alternative apps like this too . I know only TinMen Find your District Industries Centre, they have classes for skill & entrepreneurship development, usually for free. Google Meesho app. Insurance Agent: I've heard they make super money from commissions.   
many of them start as Post Office investment agent. very small commissions there, but you get a nice clientele.  and then widen the scope to LIC agent.  gradually can open MF distributor / agency too.   

have you given a thought about them divorcing ?  
that way. your Mom can get some good chunk of money & half of Dad's pension too. Depends on where she lives there could be multiple opportunities with Self help groups. A small store is also not a bad idea if you have the money to set up a small shop. 

Depending on how desperately does she need money and investment you can put up see below a list: 

1. Cooking for others (home meals, cloud kitchen) 
2. Self Help Groups
3. If she learns some English and if she is bilingual in a regional language (except Hindi), she can translate the Market Research for various research companies. 
4. Kirana stores, dairy store etc. Tinman app. Users can order today what they will have tomorrow for lunch and ladies can prepare the and hand it to tinman people to be delivered.
Try it out. It's kind of cool. Home care for the Elderly parents of NRI’s or Rich Industrialists especially post hospitalization patients. Online jobs, data entry so on. Bake cakes, food shop, authentic Indian meals home cooked. Web series of cooking for travelers. If she can improve her English, she can perhaps try for freelancing in the entertainment niche?

I'm a fresher who has started his career recently i.e 6 month prior to my night shift. I would love your suggestions from your side for what i should whether to continue my night shift or switch to day.",sup3rcalifragilistic," You need to improve your sleep quality and change the kind of diet you follow. It isn't that harmful , just maintain a proper workout routine and sleep table. i did only nights for a year, did only cause it was a 14 hour shift per day and 3 days a week working. Although i didnt mind it in the beginning it did take a significant toll on my health, i wont advise prolonged periods of it. This was back in 2009-2010 When you're awake, everyone you know would be sleeping and vice versa. Days would be bright and noisy and could give you sleeping troubles. It would/might be difficult for you to form a routine with respect to your eating habits and the likes. Your social life becomes non existent. Definitely not good for your mental health.  
  
Physically, you should mostly be okay because the body needs n number of hours of rest every day and that could be done in day time too. But you might miss out on vitamin D and endorphins. There are other ways to get this though. There's a book called why we sleep. Read it don't keep this up long-term.. but for short-term, think of it like going abroad and experiecing jet-lag. It takes a few days for body to adjust to new time-zone. Our body changes circadian rhythms based on signals that are in-turn based on eyes receiving sunlight.

simulate lighting and sound levels and trick your body into thinking it's night. Escpecially sound. I'd advice those [screw-like silicone ear plugs](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTJiT0bs3aEXyWteWfkHiyC5Ye1slELLrNYHf8GG_6KK4-nrm16).  You will have soundless sleep. Alarm clock sound penetrates through though. They cost around Rs.100. You can get them in medical shops. Depends from person to person, I've had no side effects from doing night shift for the last 3 years. No loss of sleep, or tiredness. But I do have colleagues who get a lot of issues. It's only possible if you fully commit to the night shift. Don't try to do stuff during the day. Eat breakfast foods after waking up and dinner after getting back home. 

Even small things like keeping your room dark and quiet help a lot. Get thick blackout curtains and use earplugs if there is unavoidable noise.

Edit: also maintain your sleep timings, don't change sleep schedules on weekends and holidays. Melatonin is a great sleep aid that I use when jetlagged, it really helps me - may be worth trying it out. I used to live with a guy in Pune who works night shift at a company in Hinjewadi.

Edit 1: Thank you guys for your responses. I understand that the best option is to do something by myself rather than just giving away the money to some trust or NGOs. Sadly at this moment I'm just too much overwhelmed with my family and work.  Right now I will be donating some money regularly but for future I sure hope I can make time to do something myself for others.
I looked through sites of WWF India, giveindia, People's archive for Rural India and Unicef India. I'll donate to them by rotation.

So, every month we donate to that family. We pay directly to schools and tuition teachers. Sometime they asks for books or bus fare.

You can ask your parents or relative, they will surely tell you about this kind of family. Don't.

Don't just send your money. 

Arrange and do something yourself. Any little thing. Could be running a library out of your garage. Or putting a water tank outside your house in the summer. This will be much more meaningful and satisfying than giving money. 

My mother always chides me for not giving to charity. I strictly won't give my hard earned money if I cannot see its effect on the ground. Instead I choose to give my time to causes that I like e.g. beach clean-up, volunteering in schools etc. Why not sponsor the education of kids of some economically backward people from your own locality??

[Giveindia.org](https://giveindia.org) lets you choose what cause to donate to every month. I'll tell you the thing about donating to such charity organisations. Less than half the donation actually reaches the intended target, most of the money is spent on operating expenses and advertisements and events etc. Better to find people in need of aid in your locality and give them the food and clothes and stuff. [People archive of rural India](https://ruralindiaonline.org/pages/donate), their work about covering the news across Rural India is incredible No charity will utilize 100% of the donation to direct charity.All charities have inherent management costs which can go as high as 50% in some cases.This is the cost of office,vehicle,labor,marketing , ads for more funds and man hours expended.Some may even put it aside as a rainy day fund.

This is one thing that I kinda always think to myself, if I wanna do something good I should definitely fulfill someone's wish! It really powerful if you think about it.

You don't even need to go out side for it, if you look close enough our parents or relatives always give up on something to survive every month. It could be anything, just think about having their wish fulfilled as gift.

It could be anything, finally going to some place to travel? Buying something they always wanted but they couldn't? There is always some poor kids who don't have enough resources who just want simple stuff in life but they can't afford it.

Funny how companies show their bright side when exposed to the world,money will be refunded 24-48 hours. SO i created a tweet

Guy: Beere jomato vango pizze vich mooh na mareen. Main tenu khud dedawanga. Plz Beere (Brother please don't eat the Pizza like the Zomato guy did, I'll give you some myself. Please brother. ) Can you trace him ? ""Bhaiya bhuk lagi thi toh khana kha liya"" -Delivery Boy

Awww... F^ood Good thing they don't deliver condoms... 

Bhaiyya josh chada tha, toh use kar liya Moral of the story is to not rely on zomato swiggy in tier 2-3 towns. Delivery drivers aren't very professional there Also a good time to highlight the working conditions the delivery companies create.

While the OP, as a customer, had every right to expect his order untampered, one must wonder the kind of conditions Zomato creates where the delivery boy felt he didn't have the time or the money to buy his lunch. अपने ही सोने के अंडे देने वाली मुर्गी को क्यूँ खा गया वो?

Idiomatic translation in English: Whytf would he kill his own income source? Seriously, Fuck Zomato.  The only good thing they did was Zomato Gold, from which they've pulled the rug under from now. I use the zomato app only for riding out the Gold subscription now. Always go the Swiggy way for delivery. At least they accept responsibility if someone fucks up. Zomato reps just stop responding. Funny is that this is just one guy who accepted that he ate the food. There will be hundreds other delivery guys who may eat some of your food and won't tell you.

Essentially when you order food you should be ready to eat leftovers. Think of it as price you are paying for convenience. WTF. Gwalior did not have a home delivery culture before Zomato I am guessing? LAMO..
i was hungry so i ate it.. [deleted] I had a similarly sour experience with Zomato just yesterday. I had a good Experience with their support , mistakenly rider used delivered option and according to location he was still at restaurant .

Before vanced  every YouTube add saw was of Zomato and swiggy but the many, many,many threads here have convinced me never to try the food delivery apps. Dude exact same thing happened to me in Bangalore. They refunded me 0 Rs telling refund with penalty. Guy cancelled the order telling my phone was not reachable and went and picked up the order after that. This is funny as fuck. Sorry OP. lol.

Abey yar their food sales will increase tenfold if they slash the prices by half. That's when you rob Bandhan bank. 1. I've almost reduced going to watch movies in multiplex to zero. My big TV and online streaming gives me more value for money



2. When I do go, I eat something before hand and just carry a bottle of water. I don't understand why we should buy them? Only If all of us stop buying any thing at Cinemas ...... Can we also talk about airport food? 

I recently landed in bangalore airport and had a 5-hour layover before I took flight to my hometown.

I went for a dosa outside the airport - It was ₹200+ for a plain dosa, which was terrible. 
A bland, very poorly made curd rice inside the airport was at ₹168+taxes. WTF dude?

I understand that real estate is more expensive at airports, but how can you hike up the prices 300%? Nowhere else in the world is there such a difference. Airport food is usually 10-20% more expensive but not 2x-3x times like in India. I don't understand, why do people buy from them? An average movie is about 2 hours. You couldn't eat anything before coming to the movie? Why buy such overpriced snack? Just buy a packet of biscuit and eat it before entering the hall. In the US, I can get a movie ticket for 14$ and large tub of popcorn with free refill (put together probably five times larger than the largest you can get in PVR) and a coke medium size for less than 12. That is, a single movie ticket price is more expensive than the stuff you buy for a party of two. Somehow they managed to get the equation reversed in India the stuff costs more than the movie ticket itself. WtF? Who in their right mind orders overpriced food items outside the movie theater? I recently went to Insignia Inox, which has like a base ticket price of 800, but it was a morning show so a lot cheaper. And you go in, and you have like a button to calla butler, and you have Menus next to you. They sell Dahi Puri for 300 While we are on the topic. Can we pls notice that even after literally paying money you STILL GET FUCKINNNG ANNOYING ADS! 
YouTube is better at least it’s totally free. 
I miss the days where they only show you movie trailers. Eat at home before you go to watch a movie. Middle class master race :| Maharashtra mein kya scene hai btw?Allowed to bring your own food kya I was discussing this with a family member and I said that I would gladly pay 100 Rs extra for a ticket for the freedom to bring my own food. That makes much more sense than charging sky-high prices for food. *taalis laat Last time i went to pvr, they charged me nearly 900 rs for a large popcorn and 2 medium Pepsi. Whereas movie ticket price was just 220 rs. PVR and INOX are actually in popcorn business. ^^/s recently went to one of the better pvrs. they had flavored popcorns that they gave out in ziplock bags. we took a medium for 220 bucks chocolate flavor. they were so good and so fulfilling. it was pretty great for 220 bucks. two of us shared that pack and we struggled to finish it off.  

next time went to a not so great pvr. paid 220 for similar popcorn. and it was garbage stale stuff. 

this is what annoys me. Why suddenly people are posting memes in this sub? I feel that they rob us in broad daylight. If questioned that start to fight. Sanki people I must say. PVR is solely the culprit for exorbitant food prices in cinemas. Before PVR expanded nationally, local cinema chains used to offer Popcorn Pepsi combo for 150 and samosa for 40. After looking at PVR's fat margins, other cinema chains got greedy and followed suit. Lol in Cinepolis the medium size popcorn and the large size popcorn price difference is only 10 rupees , so whenever you order medium ,the guy tells you that large costs only 10 rupees more , so you buy the large one anyways also they sell fucking Vada pav for 100 rupees that is ridiculous eventhough they use more pósh looking pav and ingredients. I hate this. Had posted this on Facebook some time back and a 'genius' in my list commented that ""Hey, the cost is high because they're giving you a chance to eat before a large screen."" I was like - that doesn't make any sense.

The concept is of a rental property - you rent a place and you can most definitely have your own food there. For example, hotel room, airplane flight. (The same doesn't hold true for a restaurant because food's the main business of the restaurant. But cinemas? It's bullshit.)

So I told him that cineplexes should be allowed to do one of two things:

1. Don't allow outside food but then charge reasonably
2. Allow outside food and charge whatever they want (like a hotel's restaurant would do).

I also said that I lean towards option 2 because it promotes 'freedom of choice'. It was heartening to see some cities' theatres allow outside food. And here in Australia where I have recently moved, ALL theatres allow outside food, as it should be. Rs.10 coffee for Rs.150. #savagepvr And then they demand Rs. 60 for a 500 ml water bottle which is filled with nothing but tap water. Pespi? Really? Instagram memes on reddit? Lol. Didn't know it was that much cheaper 😂😂 That's the reason I'm bankrupt right now Thankfully, most PVRs have started keeping a water cooler and glasses so that if you're just a little thirsty, you don't have to fork out 80 bucks for a whole bottle. Since they don't allow you to bring your own water in. Brighter side I guess. Popcorn is more expenses than the ticket itself. Dude I feel this meme to my core. Bought 2 popcorns and 2 pepsis, Rs. 1200+

I mean... Wtf. Taalis lakh when pespi chaalis lakh when Pepsi PVR: Popcorn Vada raidshow Taalis Laat I need more indian memes on reddit Dank. Food in cinema is only for crazy rich people. you have made me watch again this part of the movie Cold drinks at 300 wtf not sure if you guys know this but theatres earn very little from ticket sales and most of their earnings come for sales of these food items. For those complaining about the price, I understand all the frustration but remember that a theater's business model revolves completely on the food and beverage sector. Money from the tickets goes straight to the distributor or the production company. Maybe i am mistaken with how it works in India but as per my understanding, Theater's run only due to the sales of F&B on a daily basis and advertisements before and during intermission of the films Need a Indian meme sub why is this so true! These multiplex chains have three main source of revenue:
1. Ticketing
2. Advertisement
3. F&B (Food & Beverages)

F&B segment has highest margin somewhere between 80-85%.

Yes, they are, but *desi khana kya khila rahe ho?* Can they even be fed anything on a regular basis that isn't going to dry a prospective cat owner's (read servant) pockets? What is your monthly/annual budget coming to anyway? I doubt doggos are as expensive. But kitties are super-amusing(!), if you know what I mean, and might be worth the additional expenditure

I am estimating around 20-25k per year for a single cat if I were to adopt a stray kitten and fed it predominantly a diet of chicken, fish and egg and occasional visits to the vet. Am I right? Any home-made recipes that reduce the budget? What homemade ideas have you been employing to reduce budget and found success with, without your cats disliking the food?

There's also a strong argument against Whiskas cat food (as being junk food). 

Helpful advice would be appreciated. :)",throwawayphilos," Cat food obviously. Also you can buy the gizzards and bones(inedible parts) from a nearby chicken shop, cook and feed. 
The blood line( black part which smells fishy) of the fish can also be used to feed your kitty cat. Usually the fishmonger gives it for free. Remember to cook it however.

If you have a kitten, be careful with fish bones, they could choke.

Edit: don't give them milk, they will drink it alright but they will have a massive tummy upset. 3-4 cats from a nearby temple adopted my dad, and now I subscribe monthly to [this](https://www.amazon.in/Pure-Pet-Ocean-Fish-Adult/dp/B01CQYS1TY?ref_=ast_bbp_dp).

Dad uses coconut shells as a bowl.

Most of them are older and don't mind the dry food.

For wet food, its meat waste(skin, bones, organs etc) from a nearby butcher shop, pressure cooked with carrots and peas for some additional flavour (NO SPICES, SALT, OR SUGAR!) , but it's reserved only for the kittens.

Cats Love roasted sunflower seeds and sour cream (any fermentd milk product).

EDIT: FIXED THE LINK. Cat food, chicken bones and other rejected parts of chicken, if I buy sardines or mackerel I usually buy a little extra and steam them for her and feed her that.

There is absolutely no concept of food increasing or decreasing body heat in mainstream science or atleast the way it is propagated by Indian parents right? Please do correct me if I am wrong because I have been hearing this shit for so many years from so many different places that it is annoying as fuck.",RantsnShitpostsIndia," It is just a colloquial way of saying to stay hydrated. Let's not make everything an issue. 

&#x200B;

Dehydration is a common thing during summers. Hence they say foods to cool down. 

Additionally, we also observe eating spicy or acidic foods and toxic foods, exposure to the sun for long times lead to boils, or heat rashes. 

&#x200B;

Most of the foods recommended to cool down are meant to cool down or are less acidic (like yogurt/ lassi and all)in nature to balance diet. Ayurveda is based on superficial observations and correlations. In fact, there is no need to single out Ayurveda. All pre-scientific ethno-medicines are arbitrary. Traditional Chinese Medicine, Unani (Greek) are based on very basic (often wrong) observations. And our language has not been purged off some badly chosen terms either. For example, the term 'boil'. Why is a skin boil called boil? These common sense terms hinder our understanding.

And these systems did not know about the perception tricks played by brain. Mint 'feels' cold on the tongue because the molecules unlock receptors that are supposed to detect low temperature. Spicy food 'feels' hot and causes sweating because brain is fooled by capsaicin unlocking high-temperature receptors.

Some observations, however, still hold true even when their models were wrong.

For example, a shaman using some leaf paste along with elaborate rituals and dancing to cure malarial fever will be successful. His model might be wrong but he will succeed nonetheless. Only problem is the shaman cannot know which parts of his cure are worthless and which is the active part actually doing the treatment.

Or system which attributes disease like tuberculosis to a spirit and recommends quarantine will be right despite having a wrong model. (spirit rather than micro-organisms)

Ayurveda is the same. It's based on a bad foundation. Naturally, (pun unintended), it will have wrong diagnoses and wrong treatments. And it doesn't help that it's not revised thanks to our taboo of updating ancient wisdom. Food-induced thermogenesis. Different foods have different calorific values. Some foods take more calories to digest and others don’t so the sum total or calories or heat they add to you is positive or negative. None of this can change the fact that you seem to be a jackass. Just like other bullshits such as positive energy and negative energy.. Try beef and see the difference in your body temperature. IMO it's not about body heat but about how the foods make you feel, mostly in the gastrointestinal tract. Eating a lot spicy food has the opposite effect of eating a lot of curd rice for example and it's not far fetched to associate those feelings with heat and cold respectively. Other foods can be categorised in the same way. It’s Ayurveda. 

It’s bullshit anyway. If it's annoying you then why listen? Just do whatever you like Honest opinion, if I eat chicken or certain foods, I do get constipated(even though I ensure I have enough fiber) and limbs are heated.


I have been informed it is that the nature of my body is heat and rather consume it in low amounts. This is personal experience.


For ex : I require cooler AC when compared to other family members. I tolerate winters better but summers are hell.


Hope I get to see a good discussion. Good question though. It's easy to understand, certain food take more energy(heat) to digest than others and it matters during scorching summer Really dude?
You thinking food doesn't affect body temperature? 

Why do you drink lemonade during summer? 

Why don't you ever try eating mangoes(without soaked in water or fridge)? everyone knows it's tummo that controls this force, not food.  2,4-Dinitrophenol  is a drug that is banned in US and UK, is used by many body builders to rapidly burn off body fat. The drug works by forcing the cells to use up the ATP rapidly, forcing the body to tap into existing body fat. It was used by Russian soldiers in WW2 to stay warm in severe Siberian winter.

This drug comes with a risk of acute toxicity and is known to be lethal. One of the ways it kills is by increasing the core temperature , resulting in organ shutdown. Essentially, a chemically induced lethal heat stoke.

&#x200B;

Also,  d-*amphetamine* , a widely known recreational drug is known to decrease heat dissipation and slow the rise of core temperature. It was widely abused by runners and endurance athletes till reports of death due to extreme muscle fatigue and heart failure started to show up. Essentially ,it turned the body into a heat sink that would absorb more heat than dissipate. You’re taking it too literally.  The body heat that your mom mentions is not temperature. Bhai thoda chill maar Yeah chief, you are unfortunately after falling down a long fad diet hole.

Do yourself a favour and forget about it. It's the hot and cold diet today tomorrow it'll be liquidised steak enemas. The sooner you learn to disregard these people rather than try and change their opinion the happier you will be in life.

Unfortunately some people are far more susceptible to nonsense like this and many other products (which is why they exist) so just let them waste their lives on it and when they talk to you about it nod and agree.

The simplest way of looking at it is this: if you and your brother were of different religious backgrounds (pick any two) and he kept bringing up how his way was better than your way - would you ram your idea down his throat or stop talking to him because of it? No you'd just get on and not talk about it ever. Neither of you could be 100% right about it and you would never convince the other person, so what is the point?

Now you've gone and gotten yourself all annoyed and hot about this silly topic so go have some cooling eggs... Or was that heating eggs? ;)",Food,2019-06-10 22:12:03

Will India be liveable in the coming years? [Serious],90,cd4cwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cd4cwm/will_india_be_liveable_in_the_coming_years_serious/,84,"Consider these points before answering - 

1. The rate at which water is wasted in India (due to breakage in pipes, overflowing government tankers, etc) is tremendous when considered holistically
2. The food might run out due to the surge in population and limited lands and farmers not getting paid enough to sustain their livelihoods
3. Air pollution due to unchecked emissions from factories and vehicles
4. Religious, racial and political issues
5. Tremendously increasing pressure on metro cities like Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai
6. Government and government employees being their worst at their jobs. Add to that the ever-present corruption in almost anything

Consider all of these points and others that highly hurdle your life and living standards. Now consider how all of these things affect the poor who can't even get basic education and also the reservation system in government jobs. Like seriously, half of the country is facing water crisis and it is going to be worse in the coming years. Water is a basic resource and it might lead to people doing crazy shit for just water, which many of us waste. Pollution is increasing - air, water, noise, land. Waste management sucks, plastics clogs almost every sewer line in the country. Meanwhile, the government is busy dealing with issues like ""Mandir yahi banega"", Yogi Adityanath is burning tonnes of mango woods to kill global warming (dude doesn't know that burning produces carbon which is the main greenhouse gas). 

&#x200B;

These are the main things that the government should be focussing on because these things only dictate our living standards. And if we keep on neglecting these things, then we are fucked in the long run. 

&#x200B;

Opinions are welcomed.",kernelslayer," There's two ways to address your question/rant/whatever: a point-by-point refutation, and a big picture refutation. Let me try a bit of both.

Big picture: you need to understand our history to fully understand the scale of crises we've already dealt with. Separatist violence - Kashmir, Punjab, North East, Naxalism, Maoism, severe (real) food shortage - we used to depend on imported foodgrains before the green revolution made us self-sufficient, immense ignorance and illiteracy - we had 15% literacy in 1940s, and a paper-thin govt. Even as late as 2000s, we had endemic power shortage leading to long cuts even in summers. These problems were solved and now the country is self-sufficient in power generation, and most power sector issues are DISCOM-specific (economically).

Now we're a 3T economy, with 75% literacy rate, 600 billion dollars available for the central and state govts. to spend in tax revenue, a growing economy - exact rate of which is disputed but 5-6% is a number we can agree on.

Half the issues you raised are trivial/moot.

> The rate at which water is wasted

To an extent fixable, as our local bodies get their shit together. When on the brink of crisis, people find ways to solve problems. The tanker mafia crisis in metros is actually a boon because it provides economic incentives for conservation - people are installing unit-level IoT water meters in apartment buildings, recycling for flushing etc. and so on.

> The food might run out due to the surge in population

Balderdash. Our food production issues were solved during Green Revolution. No country with a GDP/capita of $2000 and growing is starving, and is rich enough to import foodgrains if a massive catastrophe impacts production temporarily for a couple of years. For every suicide you see in papers, there are 10 farmers making a living, not a luxurious living - sure, but can feed themselves and their families.

The surge in population bit is BS. Our population growth is slowing down, TFR is down to 2.3 which is very close to the replacement rate. If you can feed 1.3B today, you can handle 1.33B the next year and so on. At 1.6B or so our population will stabilize, and we'll finally be at a stage where the number of people is not outstripping the amount of roads/railways we build.

Worldwide, there's a glut of agricultural produce.

> Air pollution due to unchecked emissions

Every country goes through a phase of unchecked industrial growth, which is contained as those issues hit crisis levels. If you go back a hundred years you'll read similar stories about Thames or Sienne.

> Religious, racial and political issues

We had bigger religious/political/racial issues 50 years back, and law enforcement was poorer, and people were less educated. A handful of cases in backward districts are blown up by the 24x7 media.

The average Hindu might not be a fan of the average Muslim, but he has no problems buying goods or services from him. It leads to gentrification, but not religious violence.

> Tremendously increasing pressure on metro cities

Yes, our economic growth is very unequally distributed. You can leave your 20LPA job in Bangalore and get 5 offers in a week, but in a tier-3 town you'd be hard pressed to find a 3LPA job. To an extent cities like Pune and Hyderabad are taking off, but it's still too less.

> Government and government employees being their worst at their jobs.

Unkill-ish hand-waving. There are plenty of problems with govt, but they are also facing ever-increasing scrutiny, with public pressure to create complaint handling mechanisms, and expectations of time-bound handling of complaints. The situation is far better with central govt. employees, and state govts. could do a lot better.

-------------

TL;DR is that yes, we'll face hetherto unforeseen livability challenges over the next 15 years. In this time frame, we'll also start transitioning to a clean energy economy, planned urban spaces, stronger pollution enforcement and so on. All problems are solvable as you become richer, and there's no indication that we won't continue on the path of economic growth - we might slip to 5% from 9%, but the growth engine will keep on chugging along.

Edit: thank you, kind anon, for the gold :)

Edit 2: interesting quote I found from Norman Borlaug's wiki:

_Biologist Paul R. Ehrlich wrote in his 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb, ""The battle to feed all of humanity is over ... In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now."" Ehrlich said, ""I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971,"" and ""India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980.""_ it already sucks. takes me 45 mins to cover mere 5 kms. huge waste of time and fuel. Liveable if you got ₹₹₹. I would like to remind people that India has gone through pretty shitty times during the last couple of centuries. Just go through the major catastrophes that befell us. Famines, the world wars, the partition massacres, crushing poverty, widespread riots, wars with neighbors, violent secession movements, etc.

It's true, this time too it's going to be difficult. These threats that you outline might unravel our society.

But then again, they might not. I have faith in the fundamental goodness of the country and its people. These threats might well cause us to rise above our narrow differences and bond together as fellow humans. I saw a hint of this during the last floods in Kerala, when people came together to help each other. I am sure that a common enemy will force us to rediscover our shared humanity once again. Paili fursat me nikalna h I have strong opinions on climate change, so please bear with me.

I think climate change is going to disrupt everything in the next decade. Every week, there is some news about it. We read it, feel helpless and move on with our lives. Then turn around and blame it on the politicians and others. Sometimes we also act and make small changes in our lifestyle; stop using plastic bags, save water, etc.

However, nobody really knows what's in store for us. We get warnings every other week. This is the hottest month, the civilization is ending in 2050, the insects all dying, the corals being bleached, food chain is collapsing, etc. At some point, you just stop paying attention. What can we do, after all. These problems are so big and intractable, right?

Wrong. We can do something; [plant trees](https://www.livescience.com/65880-planting-trees-fights-climate-change.html). Trees are the only way we can save our planet. We all fondly remember our childhood and trees played a central role in it. I used to climb up the trees in my backyard and pluck the fruits. I haven't done that in decades. Where has our love for trees gone?

We need to rediscover our love for trees. Only then can we save the planet. I just need some way to get out of here. I'll become a taxi driver if that's what it takes. Yes, it may not seem like it but things are actually getting better. 

On the water front, our home in Bangalore had a borewell (just like everyone else), but with the adoption of rainwater harvesting and the arrival of Kaveri water, we use the borewell a lot less than before. We've noticed that the water table level has risen. As more people adopt these measures, the water shortage will improve.

On the traffic front, more public transport (like Metro) is being adopted in more cities. (Unbelievably, Lucknow has a metro now!) Overall, this will take years (maybe decades) to build out but it will definitely resolve some of the traffic issues.

Also, with good metro, high-speed rail etc. in combination with village electrification and running water, the pressure to move to cities like Bangalore will reduce. And then as seccond and third tier cities like Mysore or Mandya being to acquire modern amenities, some businesses will relocate there further reducing the pressure on the big cities.

Also, there was a research paper studying the impact of global warming on the Indian monsoon which found that it is going to result in the subcontinent getting 10% more rain. (If you're surprised by this, don't be. Warmer air can hold more moisture in it and the south west monsoon gets its moisture from the Indian Ocean, which is not going to run out of water.) This is a huge amount of extra water which will actually be good for our country. Of course, the possibility of floods and cyclones increases with global warming, but as last year's cyclone Foni showed, these are manageable problems if competent people are in charge.

Now, all this will take decades to have an impact on your immediate situation, but in the long run, we are on the right path. The most immediate problem is the water, while others will not make India uninhabitable in the short term. The government needs to sort out the water crisis. Some of the responses above highlighted most of the key issues. I work as a researcher and practitioner in the area of urbanisation, specifically in the areas of mobility, water and sanitation and governance. My reply therefore might not add any value or could be  terribly narrow and blinkered, so do bear with me. 

Indian cities, like those in other parts of the developing world, are exploding in terms of their population growth. Urbanisation at this rate is unprecedented in human history, so even though we might know potential solutions, the scale that we need to cover is mindboggling.

Unfortunately, our governments do not have the financial or human resources to structure and order this process. Therefore, while we have good policies and legislations for the most part, governments are not in a position to enforce them. Take the case of water supply in Bangalore. Pumping water from a distance of 100 kms and an elevation of 300 metres, BWSSB manages a world class system in bringing water to the doorsteps of Bangalore, spending tens of thousands of crores.  However, once it reaches the city, the horrible distribution network within the city means that lakhs of households are not connected to this network. The old pipelines also cause leakage and leads to 45% of this water to be considered as 'wasted'. Fixing the whole network would costs hundreds of thousands of crores, if we had the capacity to do it. So we don't. For politicians, they've managed to bring water for residents, so they continue to get elected. For bureaucrats, they've acheieved the same, so they continue to work in the same manner, pushing for low-hanging fruits rather than engage in structural reform. 

We citizens also contribute significantly to it, ignoring and avoiding any roadblocks that reduces our comfort. We flout building norms, traffic rules and labor laws because we know the state doesn't have the capacity to enforce the law. So whoever can afford to, digs borewells to ensure that they have a coping mechanism. However, even after knowing of water scarcity, we don't change our lifestyles to adapt to these new conditions. We still want to wash our cars daily or leave the shower running because it suits us. We don't want to install rainwater harvesting systems because we don't want to spend money. 

Right now, society as a whole is continuing on its business as usual path. The problem is that resources are running out and climate change will exacerbate all of our existing problems. Water is going to be undoubtedly the largest. Some studies have pointed out that by 2025, Bangalore would be unlivable due to the lack of water. The situation is pretty much the same in most other parts of the country as a casual scan of the news for the past 3-4 months should confirm. 

Can this be reversed? Possibly. But we don't seem to want to do it. As time goes on, it becomes more and more harder and expensive to get there as well. Unfortunately, given the humungous inequality in our society, it means that the privileged will be able to access technology and government support to continue in the same fashion. The poor will suffer. We as a country are just managing to improve upon our modest baseline in making the lives of the citizen better, climate change will definitely push it back down. Life expectancy and incomes will reduce for the poor, while expenses for healthcare will drastically increase. 

When people's lives are not getting any better, social divisions tend to widen. Violence as a whole might increase, especially in areas with little policing along the lines of gender, religion, region, caste and class. However, this is something that the State and the political class like to manage/control, so rather than an anarchic society, we may see an apathetic State which condones violence. 

The answer to issues like air pollution and water scarcity has been around for ages, we've only done what we could do to postpone dealing with the question. For air pollution, it's getting people off their vehicles and on to public transport. People reply (and legitimately so) that there is no public transport system. Governments say that they don't have the money to buy buses, although they spend an order of magnitude more on building flyovers and expressways (which only incentivise people to use their vehicles more). It becomes just another vicious cycle. 

Unless all of us come back and take a serious look at the social contract that we have and our roles within it, I think that we're all screwed. Water scarcity will be unbearable, heat and cold waves will kill off an increasing number and violence will possibly increase drastically. Food production might remain stable, but given the changes in rainfall patterns and our agricultural style, I might be being optimistic. The State will continue to function as it currently does, trying to make the best of a terrible hand. 
You and I and everyone else here will possibly continue to live a similar life. We're the elites. The above points are very much valid day by day the quality of life is degrading. Only the rich are immune to this as they dont spend much time on the ground and usually are away. You are assuming that with a growing GDP India does not deal with its water, poverty, and pollution problems. That isn't going to happen. We saw that as China grew it dealt with its problems to the point that it has better infrastructure now than most Western countries. It is a world leader in solar and electric vehicles and has taken drastic actions to cut smog levels in places like Beijing. 

Just look at what India has done in the last 10 years, brought over 250 million out of poverty. Built world class metro systems in Delhi and is in the process of doing so in Mumbai and other cities. Built world class airports in the major cities and good airports in second and third tier cities. 

India is greatly investing in railway infrastructure including building its first bullet train. It's introduced domestically produced semi high speed trains and renovated many stations. 

Per capita income is doubling roughly ever 10 years. The middle class is going to keep exploding. As people enter the middle class they will have higher aspirations for everything from education to sanitation to transportation. And once there is a solid middle class politicians will have no choice but to be responsive. 

So your ""sky is falling"" attitude is missing the point. As another poster mentioned, within 15 years India should reach 20k USD per capita GDP (PPP). This is around the level of EU member states like Bulgaria or Romania or other middle income countries such as Malaysia, Colombia, Mexico or Argentina. These are all livable places but not nearly as large as India. When India reaches that level it is going to be an enormous accomplishment and it will have incredible economic and geopolitical power as a result. Aren't point 1-5 by outcome of point 6. Is India actually livable *today*? This is ridiculous fear-mongering. Bharat has a very bright future, we just need to stay at it. We’ve accomplished so much in the last 15 years it’s insane to think otherwise. Most Northern states are 0.700+ in HDI minus Kashmir. South India is doing fairly ok. Central and NE India lag behind a lot but will catch up. 

We have the best airport and metro system in New Delhi. We’re building and investing in solid public transport and upgrading our railways. 

Land rights and labor reforms are expected any minute which will unlock a lot of capital to the middle class and make doing business much easier. Climate change? Buddy, Chennai is facing a water crisis due to 1) terrible management of their water resources 2) pollution and 3) very little rainfall. 

Our economic growth is good and we will have per capita income of 25,000 USD by 2050. Our national HDI is probably gonna be around 0.800-0.850. Not entirely 1st world tier but GOOD enough that every Bharatiye citizen has a  decent life. It depends on 2 factors:

1) No matter which [countries release carbon-dioxide](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-worlds-carbon-emissions-in-one-chart/), India will suffer because of our location in the tropical latitudes. More than 80% of world's electricity still comes from burning coal. There is a lot of coal left in China, USA and India.How will food crop production be affected by warming. While increasing carbon-dioxide might sound good for plants, how will our food crops fare under increasing heat trapped because of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and water-vapor? 

2) [Indians born after 1961](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution#Start_in_India) owe their existence to food grown by feeding synthetic fertilizers to crops. India's population in 1961 was 438 million. 900 million Indians were not supposed to be born. So, in a way, we have been living on borrowed time. Fertilizers require methane which is a by-product of crude-oil extraction. Food is tightly dependent on oil. There is a lot of oil left in the middle-east but we know how that story is going to go.

\--------------------

The timeline of collapse is hard to predict. Water problems are plaguing us now. But we are not experiencing collapse yet because we can still burn fossil energy to get water. We can use diesel power to drill down 1000 feet and pump up ground water using electrical energy (produced mostly by burning coal). In the next decade, there will be more of the same. We will drill down to 2000 feet to fetch water. For this to continue, we need to keep importing more and more oil competing with USA and China.

I predict that we will witness a great die-off (in stages) before 2050. After that, our population (with natural farming being top occupation) will be around 100 million. Cities will be deserted as food transportation and distribution (supported right now by fossil-energy) will cease. People will have to live in villages near to where food is produced. Basic mathematics says.....yes. 

Consider that India's per capita PPP income is $8000 and growing at 6% per year. In 15 years, it will be $20,000 per capita PPP, which is about the same as Mexico, Argentina, etc.  Those are definitely liveable countries. 

Population wise, India is already at 2.1 TFR, which is the replacement rate. From now on population will grow, but at a decreasing rate, peaking around 2050 and declining thereafter. 

Most of India's air pollution comes from old inefficient vehicles, which people cannot afford to replace. This will be addressed by the increasing per capita income. People will be able to afford less polluting vehicles. Removal of diesel subsidy will also help.

India is making great strides in solar power to add to this.

Water is a problem, but it can be solved by better transport facilities and desalination if needed. 

The rest of what you mentioned - Mandir, etc is just insignificant noise. Thats like saying USA is unlivable because of school shootings. Except 4 and 6, the others can be fixed. Forest man

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkZDSqyE1do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkZDSqyE1do) Yeah, we are fucked in the long run. That's for sure if we don't do something about this. We as human beings are always capable of extra ordinary feats. We can overcome this. 2 decades ago, it was very popular opinion that way India is making progress and how our five year plans are being implemented,  India will be a developed country by year 2020. 

Though we have somewhat better facilities , health care and access to some of the luxuries like car, phone and air travel, muncipal water  we are still very far behind in self sustainability.


 Reasons: the way political parties ruled India in 80s, 90s is via religion and communal gap. We all assumed the education and rise in literacy will erase that gap.
Continuing,  even today education hasn't brought much progress in the attitude of brainwashed general public.

Until if majority of population vote for basic ammenities and  matured leadership as first priority, things will remain the same.

Politicians did great job in brainwashing the most educated of the country as well.  Recently I stumbled up on a post by a person with designation of corporate director stating "" Patel statue is good for regular public as lot of contractors and raw material suppliers benefits from the project iteranary !""  Little did he agree that there are many pending irrigation and road -rail, flyovers and they provide same source of income to builders and self sustaining. 

There is no solution to this problem and emmigrating to other countries is the closest possible solution. You're on the mark with regards to deteriorating conditions. The single biggest hurdle is population which is too large to manage reasonably.",Food,2019-07-14 23:37:36

"A guy with a Higher degree than me, delivered my food today.",2054,at42mz,https://i.redd.it/fg2x2ewmrxh21.jpg,356,,SnootBoooper," I like how people here are saying that higher education in India is shit, meanwhile completely ignoring the elephant in the room which is oversupply of graduates in comparison to existing industries and jobs.   
  
EDIT: Lots of comment under my comment saying there is no oversupply, but rather undersupply of good engineers etc. From my experience, a lot of entry level position in mechanical/chemical/metallurgy don't expect much from the graduates, and you mostly learn on the job. Those are the positions I am referring to. Not referring to IT/programming jobs out there. In coding type of jobs, it is well understood that you need to learn things yourself. No matter if you are from M(assachusetts)IT or M(adhav)IT. And if you are telling me that there is an oversupply of non-coding jobs in India, then give me a break. All those careers in STEM am I right? Samosa, Tandoori, Edamame, Murg Makhani is not what I thought it meant. I understand you found this peculiar but you need to understand how the how world works mate. Its okay to do any kind of a job. This is life. If someone makes their ends meet through irregular but perfectly legal jobs so let it be. We play with the cards we are dealt with. No point in looking at others cards amrite?  In my honest opinion, Nothing wrong in doing petty works to earn some extra cash. We Indians need to stop judging someone by his occupation. 

This article is best example, sorry for pep talk but, Your past means nothing if you work hard for your future. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/billionaires-who-came-from-nothing-2013-12 MTech in India is useless unless you do from a old IIT (D/B/M/K) - even there HR prefer B.Tech students over MTech. Well a job is a job. What is the purpose of education if you think someone is big or small for a job. 
Only thing that matters is can you do justice to a job. 

 In India people think too much about doing petty jobs while in US it's fairly normal thing.  ""here I am janitor, in Russia I am physicist"" Degrees can give you an entry but it's your skill that decides your future.

Edit: added a word Thanks for the 5 star rating sir. Very obliged to keep up the streak.  He had a higher degree -- but going by your replies to comments on this post, looks like you had very little *education.* You ignorant little boy. Are you sure that you have received any education? It doesn't seem so from your post. I disagree with the comments that if you are an engineer from non  premier colleges, you are fucked.

 It's a knowledge based economy and if you have technical skills,  along with passable social skills, companies will chase after you. In the era of edx and Coursera, you have free access to the best professors and no one can blame their colleges for not doing well in life. I know guys, very ordinary guys, who went to unheard of colleges and are now at Google and Amazon. They just kept learning after graduating.

It's sad to hear such cases nonetheless, and wish more guys tried harder before giving up. A job is a job. I know some people who are delivery boys because they like riding. Well education is a bit of a ponzi scheme. An education doesn’t imply financial success or even sustainence. It’s a myth that is sold for the employers benefit. A surplus workforce is great for the employers but not for employees I shouldnt name names.

But hiring process in Indoa is shambolic. I applied to a comapny called fiserv last year in March through there job portal for multiple roles.


Just getting regection mails now almost after a year.


And I am literally like- Am I a joke to you? If anyone is looking forward to apply there please refrain from doing so.
 Dignity of labor  Dignity of labour not a thing anymore? He's earning himself and probably don't rely on his parents/might even be supporting them. Obviously down to earth guy/hardworking. Guy is better than half of Indian population.  Tfw when a company hires you as Dev ops, but assigns you to delivery duty to experience the problems first hand/s Just like Phds and ceos drove uber initially. Things will settle soon like the cab market after all the image boost and these people with bikes are gonna get 10-15k for the full time. Recently had an epiphany that we are a bunch of educated judgemental people!! So, whom are we blaming our judgemental skills on this time, family? society or the education system itself? It's the quality of the degree that matters. Most indian graduates learn nothing from third class education, can't blame the job market alone. May be he is just doing part time or may be he just wants to make some extra money on the top of what he is already making while you are relaxing on your couch and ordering food and loosing money lol [removed] There are many shitty colleges in India. Just because you have a degree doesn't means that you are educated. probably too late to the thread but here goes...

OPS doesn't seem to be *mocking* the delivery guy. rather - it seems he's ***stunned*** by the fact the Delivery Guy is doing this despite having a respectable degree.
 He could be like, nope I want to do MBA now, Mtech won't my cup of tea.  
So he didn't take any other job, joined swiggy, while he prepares for cat.  
He earns his pocket money, doesn't have gap year (looks good on resume), studies hard and becomes cxo of swiggy/Zomato in the coming years. [deleted] My question is, why is it important to know so many details about the guy delivering my food. We need to tip them regardless of all details. In today's world as always its about who you know, not what you know. A guy with higher degree than me? Most of our politicians say the same kind of thing. Welcome to dignity of labor.  This thread is more depressing than an episode of black mirror. Why are you doing this guys. Do you even know how hard it is to find a good job. We need to pay bills when we are in searching for jobs. I think delivery job is very best job because we can do when ever we want and get a decent amount of money to pay bills. 
I think Indians need to grow up from this judgemental mentality. what's the problem?

We don't know him. His financial condition or for whatever reason he is delivering food ( since I see an inherent bias in the question that delivering food is a lowly job which is fucking ridiculous )

get on with your lives people.  I hope we soon stop relating educational qualification of people with the work they do to earn for themselves. What app is this? Good observation though! We are engineers lol How is the jobs? Why does that company need to provide this information in the first place ? Cant judge someone on the basis of their work. They might under transformation or planning ahead for something in future. The problem with indians is we start ranking jobs as menial and respectful. A guy with a higher degree than you can also do your taxes, argue in court for you, manage your wealth, fix your body up, etc.

What's wrong with delivering food? Why they are showing his educational background? I mean I never seen on my app anything like that? Which delivery app is this? He could just be doing it part time until he gets a real job  Why don't anyone blame Zomato for exposing one's personal information in order to make people give out tips? We don't even know whether the whole tipped amount goes to the delivery guy without any ""convenience charges""!

Think this practice of giving out ""extra"" details than name and number to customer should be discouraged. We are nobody to judge anyone.
 I remember the 2005 - 2010 period where a lot of engineering colleges capitalized on the dreams of the people and made a hell lot of money. Ads used to be all over the place with placements and it was the chaar log who used to idolize engineering in such a way that the population was brainwashed collectively to believe that life would be set after engineering.

This thread is so depressing. I'm sure nobody would tackle the creamy layer i.e, college owners who sit on a heap of cash crashing the dreams of the oppressed.

Why do the makers of this app think that you need to know what ydegree your delivery person holds? I'm not sure if these all are really true. I saw a person having bullet according to information while delivering food on a Bajaj Platina.  Pradhan mantri fucked up yojana Cool guys a long way on degree rather than objectifying. I know it hard to see and live like this but with huge population you need to mark something/ somewhere in life to earn and live The problem is that India churns out a lot of low quality graduates, I know a lot of companies desperate to hire good workers, but the talent pool isn't good enough to hire. There are also a lot of demand for skilled technicians like electrician, plumber etc. But because it is a status issue in India no one wants to do that kind of work. We need more people in ITIs and polytechnics *chuckles* 

-I am in danger.  so He could be victim of reservation system. Don't worry, he might design an app by stealing a western idea and get rich. In fact he might already be trying is app while delivering your food.
 This is just mean on Zomatos part.  Does anyone else feel like it's weird that people are posting these ""oh look at how highly educated the guy that's delivering my food is"" stories? The comments are always the same whether they're sympathizing with the person for having to do what they consider a demeaning and ill paying job or using it to debate the status of education and employment in India they're still making a lot of assumptions about someone about whom they know next to nothing. I dunno it makes me feel uncomfortable.  Good that he is working instead of complaining.  TBH, I think there is no shame in doing any work. I guess everyone goes through this phase of being the delivery man in life. i have been one on many occasions and hated all of them. I sorted by controversial to see a shitshow and all the most downvoted comments are literally just OP playing a fool by lashing out at people. OP if you see this take a deep breath and step back for a bit don't get so emotionally invested in an internet discussion it's bad for you.  Increasing unemployment in India 😪 What is the point of your education when you are going to be so judgmental? 
This is the double standard of Indians. We'll go abroad and do odd jobs but no one can do it here. We'll dissect it to shreds. Guys like this are delivering food, or selling pakodas and illiterate goon Neta's running our nation. I know plenty of our people who graduated without being able to code if their life depended on it... Don't assume that they have skills just because they are engg graduates Well there's a good chance that this is his part time job, right? We shouldn't judge based on one sided story. Only place in the world where parents force you to study something you don’t like and they’ll happily let you live under their roof to show you off as an engineer rather than face reality and accept that they created this failure for you I swear anytime I see an Indian nationalist flaunting how we have the most numbers of engineers in the world I’m showing him this. We need to remember it’s about quality not quantity Big deal maybe he's trying for UPSC may be this is his part time job. I would not be surprised if a lot of guys with degrees are out-earned by people without them, in the coming years or decades.

 Woh BA hai lekin, chalaye woh thela    
Woh MA hai lekin, woh beche karela  Next time there are layoffs at your company, he will offer to bring you in as his apprentice. Bruh, there is one thing we need to learn from americans. people work odd jobs all the time. One of my directors (a corporate executive level guy), would drive for Uber after work and on weekends for a few hours to earn some quick extra money. 
    He did that for a bit and it paid for his cruise ship expenses. #NoWorkIsSmall  it can happen only in india  Millions of people are unemployed.     Beater truth.  

&#x200B;

Employment opportunities are very less.  That is why we are welcoming more international companies to establish their work in India so that this will generate more employment. Why is this a big deal? The fact that it is demonstrates how incredibly fucked up the class divide is here in India. Like holy shit, most suburban college students elsewhere like in the U.S. work summer jobs like bartending, waitressing, driving a Uber (sometimes even working multiple jobs), after graduation and even in between semesters (some even do during college season) to pay off their rent or student loan debts

Also the premise that everybody seems to be hopping on is that the guy is somehow going to end up delivering Chicken Biryanis for life and that must be immediately directly correlated to the education system. It could very well be him trying to earn a bit of money on the side instead of sitting idly while looking for jobs 

Even if that were true, which it almost certainly isn't, people here should be lambasting the government's failure to generate employment and implement vocational training programmes, not lambasting the fucking education system

Oh us bourgeois cunts here on Reddit I tell you All the big brain doofuses that are writing and upvoting stupid shit like ""Oh the standard of engineering professionals in India is pretty poor"", do you think the guy/gal that topped this dude's class or even a plurality of the people in his class are also delivering Chicken Biryanis as well?

If not, doesn't that directly negate your assertion that it has to do with our bad education system and not the failure to generate employment and implementing vocational training programmes by the govt for instance or other plausible, non-systemic reasons such as him simply wanting to make a bit of money on the side whilst applying for jobs?

I don't even get why you lot are adding a negative connotation to the idea of somebody having to deliver food, like Jesus Christ, lots of college students elsewhere in other countries work jobs like this. In fact such jobs are exclusively meant to be done by college students in countries like Denmark I see a lot of comments saying work ethics, surplus graduates etc..but are we not ignoring the reality here ? There is nothing wrong about dreaming for a settled perfect life and they are serious about it and hence they go for higher education. Unemployment rates in India is shooting up , that's of  no doubt..and it's not something that could be solved if we turn our face against it.  Well, an undergrad from an IIT/NIT is worth more than MTech, MS and PhD combined from BichuPichuKuchu Institute of Technology. Just post-graduation does not mean anything, name of institute is also important. Jai Modi! Jai Maharastra!! Atleast he is doing a legal work. I hope he might be enjoying his Job. The app is just making it more obvious, but this has been there for a long time, lot of candidates who ""finish"" the course after getting in with poor HSC marks with quota don't do well after college. Even candidates who had entered using management quota with poor HSC marks also don't do well.

During my first year of engineering, the person I studied with had bare minimum marks to pass HSC, but he was doing engineering with many KTs  If you're saying 'all jobs are equal, a job is a job' everyday before sleeping, you're justifying your lame ass job to your lame ass self. That's it. The world is unequal with some humans forced to do absolutely, literally shit jobs like manually scavenging while a bunch of people earn a cr. a year for just sitting around on their asses and tweeting.

Is There Any Law That States This Or Restaurant Can Do Anything according To Their Wish?",VaastavB," No, unless it is an all-you-can-eat buffet style restaurant. If you've ordered from the menu, then you've paid for it, you can take it home. Although to be honest some restaurants might have their own policies, I don't think there's any law regarding this. There's no law as such , I guess  it's upto the Restaurant's discretion ..but then they'll have to Pin that information on a board ..or  it's inserted in the Menu card sometimes ,in their policies section . That's so weird. Like, you HAVE to be the WORST restaurant manager in the world to deny a request for packed leftovers. I have a chronic over-ordering problem and I've taken leftovers back from who knows how many restaurants in how many countries (including a lot in India). If it was a thali or something, it maybe a hassle to pack it all up and some restaurants refuse A very tit for tat kinda thought. You could have told him that you'll pay only half the bill, unless you're allowed to take the remaining food home. Don't know if it would have worked but it would have been a good reply to the rude manager. With the new crack-down on single use plastic containers and things, they might not be in position to pack the leftovers.

Alternate explanation would be the dish being such that it can get spoiled and can cause food poisoning if not transported/stored properly and consumed on next day. For example '*ras-malai*' 

That said, being rude about it instead of explaining it in polite way, is wrong, but hey, we Indians don't have the rule of ""customer is always right"" \~wink\~

NOTE : I am totally with the OP on being able to carry home the leftovers. In most restaurants, usually the portion size of any 'sabzi' / rice etc. is too big to be eaten by a single person in one seating. They should be allowing the customer to take the leftovers with them (even if it is of their dogs/pets) instead of letting the food go waste. File complaint in consumer court actually , this should be promoted to stop wastage of food ... Illegal? : Not sure.

Unethical? : Yes There isn't a law that you they can pack the leftovers for you either.",Food,2019-08-13 23:09:56

And just by the way, once it's out, there's a myriad of all the new bacteria that will again enter the water. Technically, you cannot get rid of it. By that logic, each creature on Earth is non-vegetarian.

Vegetarian water. Thanks, enough of Internet for today. This was worse than those tv ads that claim to reduce fat putting your legs on that leg shaking machine. So basically before the advent of these machines everyone was a non vegetarian including Rishis Munis etc. who drank directly from the source. Interesting, so basically dahi/curd/yougurt should be non vegetarian according to these peeps This is stupid on so many levels.
The best way to achieve what they are claiming is by getting distilled water and keeping them in sterilised containers.

Also there are microbes in the air, and many normal microbial flora on the skin and in the mouth not to mention the intestine. If you go by that logic everyone is a non vegetarian. What logic. Will staunch vegetarians filter out chicken from butter chicken and eat the gravy? Going by this logic, then at a microscopic level every type food we eat is non-vegetarian like vegetables, fruits, nuts, etc. Prestige should immediately release pressure cookers that removes these microorganisms from food as well. lmao What home water filtration system will use chemicals?  In the US, the standard setups are:

1)  Water softener + reverse osmosis or

2)  Active carbon filter

Neither is intended to kill micro-organisms, both are intended to filter the water, with slightly different effects.

A water softener *might* kill some micro-organisms, but I think that's a bit dubious.  In any case, the RO should filter out their poor little dead bodies...

Who has a chlorine system in the home drinking water?  I know it exists for pools, but no one should be regularly drinking pool water. This is a gravity filter. These guys should be taken to court for advertisements like these. Because there is no regulation (or rather lack of implementation) people put out ads like this. Majority of the population falls for these. I think this is Nithyanandas brand Science: Am I joke to you? Now Patanjali will use this idea to sell water.

Pani piyo gau mutra mila kr. Sirf ₹50/L Tell me, would you rather drink hard tap water or pure distilled water ?? It also removes all of the mineral in the water, good luck drinking that shit. Do people realise that since their body is meat, they are technically non vegetarian? 100% PURE VEGETARIAN .. Is there such a thing as impure vegetarian? Aren't bacteria prokaryotes, thereby not animals? Apne ko non veg pani hi suit karta IMA has not endorsed this yet? My family and i are ok with non-veg water. Can unicellular organisms and especially viruses be classified as animals? Only in India. religions It says ""no chemicals"" below the veggie claim. Are chemicals veg or non-veg ? but is it gluten free? And I thought packaged drinking water was the best marketing gimmick! Water. The OG protein shake. So soon in restaurant like Food waiter will ask what you will have JainWater(by prestige purifier) or Non Jain Water(by common purifier) .. I don't think anyone other than Jains would care More like modern solutions require modern problems ( to sell ) I am very happy that I've lived long enough to see this day. OMG, To all the vegetarians out there, you have been living a lie!!! Yaya bETTeR drink distiLLeD water Or should I say ""Jain Water Purifier"" Do we have vegetarian petrol? I do not want fossil fuels made from dinosaur beef... A jain wet dream finally comes true This is from 2014. Did you know your parents are made of meat? So are your children! Pure live meat walking around the house with bones and blood and all inside. Remove them all and have only plants in the house. The most non-vegetarian thing that most people consume is curd. It literally has millions of live bacteria in every spoonful. Sanghi paani As per these fucking logic every boiled food is non vegetarian.

More to this the air we breathe also have germs.

The intestine does contain germs.

The Yakult, Curd, Yogurt all are germ containing food which are good for health. Reminds me of a restaurant in Pune called Surve's Pure Non-veg which is just next to a ""Pure"" Veg restaurant. Rest of the world: let’s go vegetarian to save wildlife and climate change. Not eating meat and in return stopping meat slaughter help reduce green house gases.

India: let’s go vegetarian for purity reasons as per Hinduism. Fuck environment actually, we don’t care! jo prestige se kare pyaar, wo biwi ko kaise kare inkaar?",Food,2019-06-21 04:35:51

Read somewhere and was wondering, why? My birthday is coming up this weekend. I came to my friend's place all the way down to South to spend the whole day with her. 

Unfortunately, she got called in for work which she cannot avoid. We planned a lot for the day, made reservations. But she got called in 9am shift, which wouldn't get over till 7pm. 
We are meeting after years and I was looking forward to it. Don't know what to do in those 10 hours in an unknown place without her.

Fir se bday hamesha ki tarah bakwas hi jayega. I want to tell you about my brother. My brother faced lots of problem when he was in his 20s. Weather it was financial and mental. Even when he was going through shits in his life, he used to study daily. 

He always suggest to study something, be it novel or some skill. If you dont have anything  to study, read ABCD, you will find something new in that. We wait for perfect time to study but it will never come. Problems are going to stay but one can study in that problem. My brother says that study is his prayer to god.

By god's grace, he is very successful but he still study. From last year I applied his formula and it works for me. Just try this, it might work for you.

Why some foreigners treat Indian street foods as Ewww ?,0,cd2xcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cd2xcg/why_some_foreigners_treat_indian_street_foods_as/,15,"I seriously don't understand their benchmark for food and it's hygienic. I saw many foreigners don't use gloves to prepare the Pizza, Many chefs rotate the dough in empty hand. Don't know how old the chicken / bacon is ? Most of them are processed food which is dangerous than non hygienic foods.

And their Pizza smells like shit to me. And they have more cancer patients compare to Indians (5th place in the whole world)

I know KFC is not even hygienic, Saw many controversies and some of their branches are banned in India.

But when it comes to Indian foods they say Ewww,  Yuck,... You Indians are dirty...

WHY THIS ?  


PS:  They say yuck to our homemade food too.",steveharrry," Street food, is prepared on the street. 

Those pizzas, are prepared in a kitchen inside. Where they wash their hands and keep the surroundings clean. They have regular checks for any health code violations etc. 

That stuff isn't taken that seriously in India, especially with street food. No one cares how it's made. You're mentioning about street food and stating items like Pizza, KFC. An acquaintance of mine, a 3rd/4th  gen Malaysian Indian, told me his story. He visits India on business every 6 months or so. Once he ate street food. He went back and developed serious stomach issues much later. His doctor advised him that some viruses/bacteria (whatever) can remain dormant in stomach and show up six months later.

He eats Indian foods at home in Malaysia.  And strictly avoids street food here.

So, yes, some people do get sick from Indian street food. There is a big difference in hygiene between you random street gol gappe seller who dips his dirty hand into the water and a pizzaiolo handling the dough in the restaurant. 

I guess it is just due to them seeing different food from an alien culture. When I brought my grandma pizza for the first time, she was like dafuq is this shit, I can make like 20 parathas for the same price. 

Have you heard about Delhi Belly btw? 

I like both Indian street food and western food (except anything with potatoes), especially Italian food.  

And honestly Indian tasted great but can often look unappealing. Stop giving a fuck about them. Why does it matter? You say foreigners and then refer to them as having rank 5. Bolna kya chahte ho?

For your solace, they don't wash their ass after shitting. Just wipe with paper towel and boo! Ewww... The issue isn’t street food, it’s the water used in the preparation of those street food. I think there was a post on r/India about a pani Puri vendor filling water from the toilet...

Do you still blame them? Because it will give you rocket shits strong enough to propel you right to the moon.  Not because it’s spicy, because contrary to what you folks seem to believe we can handle our spicy food just fine, but because it’s covered with wind-blown dirt, dried dog piss and shit and all sorts of intelligent life forms breeding in those giant piles of garbage.

"This summer, when you order food from Swiggy/Uber Eats, treat the delivery person.",301,b6gt98,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b6gt98/this_summer_when_you_order_food_from_swiggyuber/,139,"Whenever I get food from Swiggy or Uber eats in summer afternoons, I order something extra for the delivery person, like a bottle of Coca Cola or a milkshake. 

It makes them extremely happy and it's a good thing to do in hot summer. 

Edit: By *milkshakes* , I didn't mean expensive stuff that costs Rs.150-200. 
Anything small like a soft drink, or a quick snack is something I usually give out. I don't spend more than Rs.50 on it.
Surely makes them happy when the temperature outside is 41 C. 
And yes, offering cold water is also good. ",reva_r," Not only this. If you can try to stop and let the rickshaw-puller pass. It won't cost us shit if we stop suddenly in a hot afternoon in an air-conditioned vehicle, but that person will lose the whole momentum. And they said, Money can't buy Happiness. /s.

Good Gesture, OP.

Also, if you can't buy them anything, the least you can do is ask them for water.  Dude i myself eat ₹99 lunches ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I wouldnt order Coke even for my enemies. That shit is poisonous. That's a good idea. I normally offer water to everyone and tip 40 or above (these guys earn 40/delivery), tipping makes a huge difference for them, plus it gives you this Serotonin high, win-win if you ask me. :)  


Specially make sure you offer something to your local postman, cycle pe delivery karte hain, plus sab 40+ hote hain. Bhai giving cold good quality water is good enough.

Cold drink : if you mean soft drinks like coca cola, seriously don't do it. They are working for food industry ffs. Offering them sugar water or random quality/temperature water and wasting their time is illogical, they can carry their own safe water bottle in that 100 water bottle carrying capacity bag. They are getting paid decent money for the work or you can just give them a smile, rate high stars and tip them in money instead of doing this cringy shit. They are not usual delivery guys or postmen delivering 450 packages in one trip without enough space to carry water. No thanks. Don't need the US tipping system here Milkshake cost more than my Biryani. Nope!! Will give him water if asks Meh. Donate to your local aanganwadi some English books.  [deleted] I'll give them 5-star chocolate, when they will ask for 5star rating. Yes and give them some gold in wedding season.  I offer water to every postman, delivery man i get Most of the delivery folks who deliver to me already have one foot reversed to take off as soon as I extend my hand to collect the food. 🙂

Nice suggestion though, I will try to have buttermilk prepared and chilled for them in future. This is elitist ideology. A lot of people can't afford to. Save that money everytime you order and put it in a FD. Will they stop eating our food then? Well whenever the delivery guys comes at my door I make sure I ask him if he needs water. It's the least you can offer. A chilled can of beer.. 🍺... And some masala peanuts and pickle.


 LOL. Visit some restaurant swarmed by those guys and listen them talk about their customers. I bet you won't offer them water, let alone milkshake. It is always condescending with a garnish of mc bc. ""behen ke laude change nahi rakte."" ""bhosdiwala kachre gali mein rehta hai"",  are some convos I've overheard plus some explicit things about ladies. I'm sure not all of them are like this but fucking shit tons are! I have stopped ordering anyway. Reading the later comments on this friend I think #RedditIsNowTOICommentsSection Stop ordering in the afternoon, that will also help. I order only coke or milkshake through swiggy/ubereats. What now? I always take a bottle of cold water whenever I order at noons. I order a lot so buying an extra drink everytime would cost me an arm and a leg. Even offering water is welcome. That's a cool idea. I tip them every time but will consider doing this instead from now on. Thanks I also give cold water to courier delivery man.

Makes me happy as well. Otherwise, I'm no good for anything. I have increase my tipping amount for this very reason. As long as they can prove they have not already helped themselves from our order. /s And this is why i hate r/india, people shitting on op for being kind.

Share away!,ppatra,"  I had a favourite biryani restaurant near my college. One day, I went there early in the morning. They said they were preparing and would take about an hour and told me to wait. He left the kitchen door open. I saw a guy holding a rotten chicken which had green fungus kinda stuff all over it. He was plucking out some pieces of the chicken which didn't have green fungus and stared preparing it for the biryani. Never went to that restaurant again. In before, someone posts the Pani Puri waala peeing in the water handi. Ayy Bhai /u/ppatra kaise ho? Famous hogaye aap. Todhe hum pe bhi nazar daalo. Not me but this incident of Thane based Pani Puri vendor [pissing in cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoeuvmcgBBQ) made news. Used to love eating this road side Bhurji Paav. Would often have light dinner at home so that there's space for me to devour the Bhurji. Got acute stomach infection on one such occasion, totally lost the guts to ever eat it again. Been good 7-8 yrs now, I miss it. I miss it a lot. Unhygienic stuff doesn't scar me. What really pisses me off is staff being arrogant and even going to the extent of assaulting patrons. Friend of mine was witness to an incident at Cafe Ekante (Kolkata) where this lady was roughed up over a bottle of water. I've personally witnessed minor brawls over stuff like happy hours. 

Restaurants need to be more upfront about their pricing policies. And hire staff not goons. Went to a place which served Kolkata food. The mutton was sweet. I'm never going back there. Found a baby cockroach in Sambar at a 3-star, pure-veg restaurant in Hyderabad.

I found it after everyone was done eating. I was the last to finish and took a little more Sambar, and at the end of the bowl was the dead cockroach. 

We were even served aloo that had gone bad. It smelt rotten and we sent it back. But the Sambar smelt fine and we had it.

Edit: 
This one happened in New Orleans dying Mardi Gras. 

We went to a bar, ordered some food. It had open air seating. Most of it was filthy as a lot of customers were drunk and they were not maintaining hygiene. 

So we got our food and started eating when my sister smelt pee. She looks to the side and there's this guy who was peeing right beside our table. The pee was flowing towards our feet. It was disgusting, we just got up and left without eating anything. this one from my side, its my first eating out in restaurant, i think warm lemon water at the end was meant for drinking...  you know the rest. I have a thing against cockroaches. So I have been going to this restaurant quite often for my lunch. It's cheap and affordable and not quite hygienic but that's okay, because the food is good. So as I'm about to dig into my biryani, I see a swarm of roaches coming out from some corner and literally making a headway for a pile of plates with leftovers in the other corner. I call the busboy and start cussing at him and he just starts squashing the roaches with his chappal. Needless to say, I left without finishing the biryani.

And then there's this other thing: flies seem to be pretty common everywhere in Delhi (or UP), and I used to see flies swarming all over the place in almost every food joint in Delhi. It just ruins my appetite. I just can't handle files. I have grown up in a pretty fly-free environment and they are not that common in my city. So I am usually amazed at how unfazed people seem by these swarm of files attacking everything from their momos to their tandoori chicken. There used to be a restaurant near my PG where my roommate and I used to eat almost daily. One evening, as we were having dinner, a rat crawled on top of my roommate. We complained to the manager and he told us it would be taken care of.

Next day there was a cat to take of mice. Bought biryani from local restaurant called mezbaan it was past 12, it was rotten  never went again or looked at it Remember chawla biryani incident of delhi .. bc maine to bahar khana hi band kar diya Hmm, I remember going to a wedding somewhere, there was a samosa, I bit into it, and immediately spit it out, cause it contained a real live cockroach which ran around in my mouth.

India Jains: Why are these youngsters renouncing the world?,66,caewoj,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48879591,62,,krishividya," These girls are too young to take this deision, parents encourage them for the ""honour"" it brings to their family: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXlStl6G5Hw just as you cannot vote, drink and have sex legally below a certain age, children should be only allowed to choose religion after that certain age I have 30 years of Life. Engineering, Corporate life, breakups.
I wish I had gone monk sooner. >She will never use a vehicle, never bathe, never sleep under a fan and never speak on a mobile phone again.

OK with every single point save ""not bathe"". And yeah, **ck religion. [deleted] But isn't that her choice, just like Zaira? /s

Seriously, this is brainwashing of the highest level. Nothing more. Any Jains here who support this? This is Child abuse. I have been waiting for someone to pick this topic up. Sadly, Jainism doesn't attract much criticism for some unfathomable reasons. There's a rampant wave of teenagers becoming monks, at least in Mumbai where I live. Its crazy and horrifying. 

&#x200B;

These white clad monks brainwash their followers by paraphrasing their scriptures in fluent English. Their system is flawed just like every other religion. In my opinion, they're not great just because they renounce all materialistic things in life. There's no substance to their reasoning. They don't accept food from anyone who's not Jain. That's discrimination there itself. Also, everybody needs food to survive. They should earn their bread by sweating instead of cashing in on their monkhood, which contradicts their claims of non-materalistic life in the first place. Its easy to pretend to be on spiritual journey when your monkhood ensures food and shelter. 

&#x200B;

Coming back to the crazy trend, Jain communities treat these monks as gods. No surprise their kids aspire to become one. They hold grand ceremonies to give farewell to the kids who wanna be monks. That is an outright mental abuse of teenagers. FFS someone should raise voice against it.  Jains have little to no history of reform or revolution in their practices at massive scale through means of criticism, protest or upheaval. Recipe for most regressive practices in the system. It feels so disheartening watching all these talented kids renounce everything & that too for what? Inner peace? Soul searching?

What a difference those kids could have made to the world… I have a contrarian take on this. This may well be the route to a happier life than the life led by the average person.

The other point is that the kids are too young to decide. But aren't they also too young to decide they want to live the default life chosen by our society? We are all also equally brainwashed since young to be materialistic and value certain things over others. Rich people things I might be downvoted for this but this news shouldn't be a major issue. It's their personal choice just like we choose science, arts or commerce. Now you would say they are brainwashed by religion but weren't we brainwashed by the society to choose engineering while we either had some other career plans or no career guidance. If these kids are brainwashed to renounce the world, even we are brainwashed to gain academic success, a high paying job, a good looking wife, cute children, huge house, luxurious cars and foreign travels thinking that they might bring happiness to us. But in reality we exhaust ourselves as we run behind the materialistic world. Great logic guys.

How is commute from B'LORE-DELHI (and vice versa) in Rajdhani/Shatabdi for women travelling alone?,31,cj6u6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cj6u6w/how_is_commute_from_bloredelhi_and_vice_versa_in/,27,"Which class is safer and comfortable (and value for money)? 

Are there female police personnel on the train?

How much time does it take? Do they stick to the timings given on IRCTC or are there delays? 

Is there any other equally faster train?

Me and my sister have never traveled by train. This year, she may have to make frequent commute b/w these cities and flights will be expensive.  We're looking for alternatives.",SuddenCancel," Rajdhanis, Shatabdi, Durontos are usually safe, even in 3AC.

However, Rajdhanis can be more expensive than flights. For example, a Rajdhani from Delhi to Bombay costs 2800, while flights start from 2500. So if you plan a bit early, flights can be cheaper than trains.

I just checked, the Rajdhani from Bangalore to Delhi is 3.3k, and takes 33 hours. At the same price or even cheaper, you'll get a flight if you plan in advance. Make sure you use sites like Skyscanner. I prefer 2AC because of bigger seats.

Train journeys are good as long as time travel is less than 15 hours

But great once in a while to do a solo long train journey and spend some time alone. How much would it cost? Cause airline tickets should be around 3.5 k -4.5 k I think >Is there any other equally faster train?   

Duronto is faster by an hour. see here:  
https://erail.in/trains-between-stations/new-delhi-NDLS/ksr-bengaluru-SBC   

>Do they stick to the timings given on IRCTC or are there delays?   

check in [NTES](https://enquiry.indianrail.gov.in/ntes/index.html). can see the past 1 week running timings.  
site is a bit slow, often.   

getting tickets in these trains will be tough. need to buy 90+ days in advance.  and when you book in tatkal, that'll be super extra expensive .  choose flights.  
if flights between Delhi-Chennai are cheaper, take them and do the Chennai-Blr by bus / train. Ideally, 2nd AC for comfort but 3rd AC is usually clean and safe in Rajdhani and Durontos. 

Keep in mind that Rajdhani will have something like a surge pricing called 'Dynamic-fare'. So if you book tickets in advance weeks before the travel date, you can save anywhere up to Rs.1000 for 2nd AC.

Female police personnel: unfortunatey not. Though staff and helplines are relatively more responsive these days.

Time delays: Rajdhanis runs on priority and are always provided clear signals to avoid delays but \~60-90 mins delay is something I would always consider as buffer for long journeys. In winters, you can expect delays when trains are arriving towards Delhi – due to low visiblity. 

Cost: 2nd AC will cost about 3200-4000Rs. 3rd AC about 20% less. And 1st AC about 5-6K. Which is as costly as a flight if not more but it's also extremely comfortable. Female?

Alone?

2AC is the best bet for you. Have traveled with Rajdhani on this route, 3AC, several times and it is very safe, comfortable and was always on time. 

I traveller once on this route in sleeper class and had a real difficult time as it was summer and train passed through Andhra during the day, it was horribly hot.. 

I remember very peculiar thing though, once the rajdhani reached around jhansi early morning hours I think, the supporting staff came along to 'warn everyone, UP is coming, be ware of your goods'. Apparently, people would come in from on door, walk in, take a bag and get down from the other door.. I've traveled from Mumbai to Delhi alone quite often both by 3AC and 2AC Rajdhani. Never faced any issue or felt unsafe. I don't think it'll be any different for b'lore delhi Rajdhani. Once you reach Delhi however, it'll be a different ballgame! Stick to Ola Uber in the city and all will be fine, also try to travel in the city only between 7am to 8pm if you can help it. As for your questions:

3AC is usually more value for money. The crowd is mostly similar in 2AC and 3AC.

I've not seen any cops in the compartments but have seen them making rounds sometimes.

Rajdhani trains are quite punctual and have never experienced any delay more than a few minutes.

Duronto's are just as fast if not faster. 

In terms of time I feel flights are still the most cost effective if you book in advance, as it gets closer however, the trains are better options provided you find tickets. Rajdhani's also have dynamic pricing so the tickets get more expensive as you get closer to the traveling date.  

As a woman traveling alone I always choose side upper berth or upper berths on the other side. If I don't get it while booking I try and exchange with somebody. I like the privacy that it provides because you don't have to wait for other passengers to use these berths like you would for lower and middle berths. It helps a great deal when you have annoying or over friendly co-passengers that make you uncomfortable. Shatabdis are for short distances. Chair car has 3 x 2 seat configuration and there is first class a.k.a executive class having bigger 2x2 seats. Entire train is AC and comfortable. Seats are spacious and windows are large. Here I would recommend CC (chair car) as EC doesn't offer any particular advantage. 

Rajdhanis generally connect state capitals to Delhi but there are a few exceptions. 3AC is a bit crowded and 2AC fare is mostly comparable to LCCs if booked in advanced. Also if you get a side berth it will be same in both classes ! (2AC has curtains though). Regarding safety, robberies do happen occasionally in overnight trains. That being said if taking an overnight train is the only option then Rajdhani would be the fastest, comfiest and safest one.

Rajdhanis & Shatabdis are generally on time (compared to normal trains). But for a specific train you can check Arr-Dep history on Indianrailinfo.com. 3AC is ok. Avoid side lower berth like the plague - have had a bad experience where I was molested at night (but that was in sleeper). I'll recommend that you travel in 3d AC. The trains can get empty at the last stations. 

My relative had a terrible experience when she was traveling from Kochi to Mumbai by Duranto in 2AC. A guy from catering staff came and sat next to her near the end of the journey. The whole compartment was pretty much empty and this guy was staring at his phone sitting next to her. She was terrified. She has decided to stop traveling by 2AC, the third AC is a lot more occupied by the end. It will be fine. Just be alert and follow usual rules that you do when traveling alone on the roads/public transport ( carry a sharp object if it makes you feel safer). Your bags should be secured, especially when traveling through UP. I've done 3rd AC alone, but 2nd AC is the best best, but that is expensive. Oh, and upper berths are the best. Rajdhanis are 100% safe",Food,2019-07-29 13:23:07
What's something India genuinely does better than other countries?,43,c67jj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c67jj4/whats_something_india_genuinely_does_better_than/,136,I saw this question about America in /r/askreddit. I am curious to know about India. Thanks.,ask2sk," &#x200B;

Affordable healthcare. (at least Primary ) Losing their self-respect upon seeing a celebrity. Pharmaceutical Patents.

Accessible Railways (they may be non-punctual, but they're VERY accessible).

Accessible and cheap Postal System (again, somewhat slow - but very accessible). Internet and call tariff

Online services

Books, availability and price

Cost of living in general

Relationship with parents

Connectivity with various parts of country

Space research 

Affordable health care

Low corporate overreach

And above all, availability of chai/tapri at every nook and corner in the country. Corruption . Banks. Indian banks are so much better than most European ones which are stuck in the 90s. How friendly strangers are to each other and how easily one can have meaningful conversation with them. Making kids.. 1. Food

2. Gun Control 1. Secularism. Our remaining standing after Partition was a bloody miracle.

2. Jugaad(Innovation with limited resources). Read up on how we got our nukes, missile shields, and supercomputer.

3. Non Alignment with foreign powers. Only Yugoslavia beats us on that. And you know how that ended.

4. History and culture. We are a continent unto ourselves. Mangoes Freedoms.  Not the guarantee of freedoms.  But the actual freedoms people enjoy. Just moved here as an American so here are some things I’ve seen. 
-Apps for everything. Very useful and indicates the strength of the tech scene. 
-mastery of computer science . The only reason I can be here is bc I am surrounded by people great at computers. 
-abundant and cheap food. Can get awesome meals right off the street. 
-colorful , cheery dress. It makes walking around interesting and fun. 
-good demeanors 
-nice clothing stores (like Max) 
- feeling of optimism Fruits. No one even comes close in variety and quantity Genuinely, spirituality. The more you dive into it the more you figure no other country has this depth of knowledge. Ayurveda and general holistic living sprang out of this reservoir. It's nice we are discovering it again. No one can compete with us when it comes to honking on the roads I like family oriented culture here . It gets very isolated in  western countries . As a foreigner:

Vegetarian food

Animal treatment (I guess? Ahmisa and all that)

Joint family living + family networking 

Oldest living languages (Sanskrit, Tamil?)

Oldest living but also widespread indigenous cultural and religious traditions (AFAIK) India is filthier, poorer, unhealthier than most of its peers in the developing world

But after traveling extensively, I can confidently say that India has substantially better services. It is also far more plugged into the global culture than many developing peers.

Booking train tickets online, digital services, train/road connectivity, number and availability of brands and retail services - India does these very well. Friendliness.

How I miss it. Worshipping cricketers Payment Transfer. 

I am serious. Moral Policing. Not policing but moral policing. Money transfer through UPI. Simple, safe, and fast.

Have a smile on the face and be optimistic despite how grim the conditions might be.

Multilingualism. Ban things. Hamare sanskar aur adarsh /s You should have tagged post as serious. Too many joke answers. Mobile wallet payments. Maybe contentious - but we count our votes faster and come out with a result in fairly short order.  Definitely better than any other country with a population of 100M or more.

Better care of people with low level mental issues - in India, they are often at home, given some level of responsbility.  In the West, they'll be in a facility & drugged up.... which probably makes them worse.

End State / Palliative Care - In general, the Western approach is keep alive at any cost (tubes/machines/chemicals).  The Indian approach is quality of life for whatever time they may have remaining.

Serve as the world's generic medicine factory - Millions of lives saved around the world through access to low cost drugs.

Others:  Fairly low levels of medical bill induced bankruptcy, low cost data erc, Selfie deaths. Mediocrity. Being average is in our blood. Very few people want to give their 100%. Food! Medicines. We are the largest and cheapest manufacturers of medicines in the world. 

Electronics:China::Pharma:India Tasty vegetarian food with a variety of dishes
(Relatively) cheap and easily accessible healthcare, especially primary healthcare
Cheaper pharmaceutical drugs
Affordable public transport options which reach almost all corners of the country 
Cheap data and internet service 

These things come with their cons -

Cheap labour services for the middle and upper middle classes
Affordable higher education

My friend had the opposite experience. 

Ordered in Delhi, delivery guy started from Bangalore. Climax : The food actually is Maggi cooked by a dhaba.  It takes 12 minutes in Swiggy to place the order. 12 freaking minutes.

Usually i just choose the closest option with the chat bot and i get an instant refund (always provide pics). Also how much do spend on swiggy per week and are you a super user?

Swiggy - it's a very rare error so we won't       compensate you, contact us if it's  a lizard. Raise the issue on twitter to @swiggycares. The CS rep on chat was refunding 30 bucks for an item worth 80 bucks. Raised the same issue on twitter and got my hard earned money back. Link the screenshot just for reference.

Swiggy customer service is deteriorating and CS reps seem to be powerless in front of the automated refund system. Honestly, fuck Swiggy and whoever approved their refund policies.  
  
Once I ordered a Chicken Burger Meal worth ₹270 and only got Fries and Drink, no burger. As a grand token of apology, Swiggy offered me a whopping ₹50 coupon for a burger that was atleast ₹160.  
I simply uninstalled it right there, even though I've a annual super plan. Now my monthly food expenses of ~6k goes through Zomato/Uber Eats.  
  
Issmein tera ghata, mera kuch nahi jata. Happened to me with Zomato using the WC coupon for cashback. ""It's a technical glitch, you can order again and the coupon will work"" I use zomato and get better discounts. Zomato compensates even if the delivery is late but sadly they don't have something like Super in swiggy Tweet at swiggycares . They will definitely give you a refund. hmmmmmmmmmmmmm Sorry to inform you but you have Ebola

OP - Hmmm Swiggys CC sucks. Ordered pizza worth Rs. 382, the deliver boy messed up and all the toppings and cheese was off, right at the house gate clicked pictures and started chat. After half an hour of wait the customer rep replies with the same bullshit. Swiggy is shady is fuck in this things..


 Also one more thing check out the price of an item while ordering with them and the same item price on the menu of the restaurant.. Its usually 20 to 30 bucks higher on Swiggy..

"Indo-Pak relations, diplomacy and the people - some food for thought",2,cofk5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cofk5d/indopak_relations_diplomacy_and_the_people_some/,1,"Incoming Rant!

Our opinion regarding our neighbors differ widely depending on what kind of political ideology we hold, and its probably the same on that side of the border too.

I'm going to take a neutral view on this, the world isn't exactly black and white. The extreme hindu nationalist view that every Paki is like a Burhan Wani or Hafiz Saeed is obviously very wrong. But equally wrong is the view of every pseudo leftist that they are like innocent kids holding lollipops! They aren't as bad as portrayed in movies like Gadar and Border, but they aren't as good as portrayed in Razee or Haider also. The truth is always somewhere in the middle or center.

Common sense tells me that most of them are just individuals like us who want to be happy in life. We aren't exactly good friends but we interact a lot culturally, our artists travel there and they come here. Looking at this positively, we are pretty much moving towards a European Union like situation, though we aren't exactly there yet. We get along well generally speaking, except when it comes to KASHMIR!

Now coming to that, let's take a simple house analogy. There are two families living in a single large house separated by a border going through, one family is called IN and another called PK. Each family gets along well with the other, some members move to the other side every now and then and chat with them through internet too.

Now imagine there is this schizophrenic child called KASHMIR who is throwing a lot of tantrums! This kid isn't able to decide whether it wants to move towards one family or the other (or may be it doesn't even want to live in that house but wants ""azadi"" from it!). Both of the families are emotionally attached to this kid and want it to come to their side. While the families usually get along well, they resort to verbal abuses and even fights when the question comes of taking custody of this kid!

I say why both families are spending 90% of their energies on this useless kid when they have more serious problems to deal with? Let them keep the existing relations they have with that kid (namely PoK and IoK from each family's perspective) and simply move on? Forget taking complete custody of that kid and move on with your lives. Let the kid throw all kinds of tantrums, don't listen to it. Both families' peace and prosperity is far more important than this one single kid. So, I say forget all about this kid and simply move on in life? What ya say?",eagle_monk," The question is not whether we understand that Pakistanis are somewhere in between, the question is do we understand we are the same way too. Just like Pakistan we have done good things and bad things. It is our ( and Pakistani) obsession to hold ourselves in higher moral compass that makes us look at the other as the devil incarnate.

There are no details of user on the bill that came along. I called up the restaurant, the receptionist told me all they can provide me is Swiggy Id as they don't receive user details; the delivery boy details vanish in their system once the order is picked up. ( Restaurant owners, can you confirm if he was being truthful? )

Tried calling Swiggy but their customer care service is not letting me through for I haven't placed any order at the moment. How can I find out who was the anonymous sender?",SilasNashh," Swiggy ID will be connected with a mobile number or FB account, and Swiggy customer care has the details. You can try talking to an executive with the order ID and confirming the address, mentioning that it might a security related issue.
Restaurant owners don't have details. Is she being stalked/harrased already? If not, I think you are being paranoid, as it could simply be her friend messing with her. Why don't you register an online complaint for being stalked? Stalking is still illegal in India AFAIK

Attach that acknowledgment and send a mail to swiggy escalation department. 

Swiggy will have to give the details of the person placing the order. Support@swiggy.in Tweet it. Only way to get attention.",Food,2019-06-10 00:22:59
"Despite being one of its birthplaces, India has forgotten many varieties of rice",187,ca7sx6,https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/written-on-the-grain-rice-production-india-rice-varieties-india-5814790/,32,,madamplease," It's true - I just recently discovered short grain Ambur biryani and it has actually changed my life in a small way. 

IMO Basmati is actually a very boring rice and doesn't soak up the biryani masala properly. Fun fact: there's a spicy variety of rice named Kalanamak grown in Piprahwa (UP).

Bonus fun fact: If you get a chance to go there, make sure to visit the Piprahwa stupa, among the oldest in the world, and also the site from where the Buddha's bodily remains were excavated (and later gifted to the Thai royalty by the British to earn their goodwill). India has forgotten its varied variety of grains, India is also forgetting its varied variety of Bananas (North India has forgotten them). There are many indigenous foods India has forgotten or in the process of forgetting them. Rice and millet varieties are astounding. And delicious. I have zero clue why shops import and restaurants use so much quinoa from S America when foxtail is just as delicious and accomplishes the same thing from a culinary perspective. This was very informative. Thanks for posting Well be slave to mnc seed companies and follow IPR dictated by US.
Need open source seeds movement. The Edible Archives team mentioned in the article had set up a food stall with different rice varieties at the Kochi Bienalle, everything was phenomenal and I learnt so much. You guys should definitely keep an eye out for them if they pop up elsewhere.

And people think BJP will deliver development across the country next 5 years. *Achche Din Intensifies* It is Rs. 12/day.

[NP] Advice on easy to cook food.,27,bovls1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bovls1/np_advice_on_easy_to_cook_food/,39,"So I moved out of my parents house around 1 month ago to a new city. Since then , I've been having trouble with what food I should eat. I usually order something from swiggy but it's getting too expensive. Last month I spent around 10k on food which I ordered from outside. I think it's high time I learn to cook my own food now as it's also affecting my health. Can you suggest some easy to cook meals for one? I'm looking for suggestions on what I could eat for breakfast that are easy to make and require least amount of time and cheap. I have the utensils , an induction cooker and a microwave. Please advice in detail.",xxwranglerxx," Not sure if you know this, but there is this technique called OPOS: One Pot One Shot. It take more time for my mom to cut vegetables than to cook it. North Indian sabjis are cooked in 10 mins or so and South Indian ones in 5. Super fast and easy IMO. 

It has a bit of a learning curve but even I started learning from her because cooking has become ridiculously easy now. I'm able to cook roti, 2 sabjis, dal, chawal in like 30 mins maybe. 

If you want to learn, join the groups ""OPOS School"" and ""OPOS Support Group"" on Facebook (I cant include facebook links in the comment). They have around 1 lakh members and are pretty responsive when you need help. 

A couple of good blogs in this field: 

* [The Millet Table](https://www.millettable.com) : Focuses mainly on healthy recipes using OPOS and Millets

* [Anyone Can Koch](https://anyonecankoch.wordpress.com) : General OPOS recipes. 

Trust me, it has a steep learning curve, but it has changed my life. Everyone in my family uses OPOS now to cook.

Example Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhyHLzteQXQ Start off with eggs. Pretty much everything is easy and you can google whatever kind of eggs you like.

If you want to make proper meals, it's best to get lots of tupperware boxes, make prepared meals and freeze them, since you have all the stuff you need anyway. This is what I did in college:

* Take chicken breasts(4-6 boobs) and dice them into pieces

* Pan fry some chopped onions in oil with salt and garlic till they're mildly golden/soft

* Add the chicken to the mix and add more oil. Just enough to make the surface wet and so that nothing sticks on the pan.

* Once the chicken is golden brown, take a bite with a fork to see if its okay

* Add about 4-5 chopped tomatoes(finely) to the mix. Squish them a bit to release the water. The tomatoes should make the whole mixture more wet

* After the tomatoes have been squshied, and the broth feels consistent, add masalas or toppings that you like. I prefer garam masala, peas, capsicum, red chilli powder, but you can also go with mango achaar(tastes brilliant), green chillies, bell peppers, curd(not too much). See what condiments are missing and experiment and be creative. Add a bit of soya if you like.

* Once everything is done, it'll look like a hot mess. Let it cool a bit and put all of the food in the tupperware boxes. This should be enough for 3-4 meals. 

* Keep the boxes in the freezer. You can take it out, and microwave the food whenever you want. They stay okay for 2 weeks. You can have it with frozen rotis from metro or bread.

All of this would help you save a lot of cash

_____________

TIP: If youre worried that the tomatoes might lose water when you chop them, or that they're too fucking squishy, boil them first. They would expand and break through the skin, which you can peel off and you'll hold a solid tomato kind of like an orange. You can chop that very easily and that blends quickly into the mixture too.

PM me if you're confused about any of this, or want to know other stuff that you can make. Have fun! Sandwiches with bread. You can put various things in it like different sliced meats, omelette, salade, anything you want. Here are some simple breakfast recipes. Buy your favorite bread to accompany it:

1. Eggs: Fry em or boil em, good start to the day. Easiest to make.

2. Green Chutney: Buy Coriander Leaves previous night and use grated coconut. Throw in Coriander, Coconut, one garlic clove, chilli (if you like) and salt into a blender. Tasty chutney is ready in 15 minutes. Needs to be stored in the fridge if you want to have it later. NOTE: About coconuts, grate the entire shell and store in the fridge close to the freezer. Will last for days. Do not leave it out. Throw it away if it starts to smell sour.

Dinner suggestion:

I usually have rice with any curry so I have a dedicated electric rice cooker. Its a fucking breeze.  Just add 1 cup rice, 2 cups water (same rule applies for more quantities, water=2x quantity of rice). Fill it shut it and forget it (after pressing the cook button of-course).

If you aren't a rice guy, buy readymade chapatis that need to be heated on tawa. Saves a ton of time. Also, get yourself a decent pressure cooker. It's a lifesaver.

For example, let's look at 15 minute toor dal:

\- Cut 1 onion diced. 1 chilli and 1 garlic clove. Get curry-patta if you can.

Cooking is as simple as:

	\- Oil in pressure cooker. Wait till hot.

	\- Throw in the cut chilli and garlic, wait a minute, then add curry patta

	\- Throw in the onions, wait for them to be translucent

	\- Throw in soaked dal

	\- Add water. Typically 2-3x amount of dal

	\- Add salt. Close pressure cooker and wait for 1-2 whistles.

	\- Turn off, let it rest and enjoy

Dal would take you 30 mins max including the time to cut the veggies.

Hope this helps. Cooking for yourself is the healthiest, and most cost effective way to feed yourself. All the best! Maybe [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnHxGBnLP5w) can help. The fastest thing you can make is egg bhurji. It does not take more than ten minutes and you can have it with bread. Don't bother with roti even though sabjis take little time to make. It's not easy to master and the flour makes a huge mess. 
Daal and rice, egg/mushroom fried rice/noodles, stir fried veggies are easy to make too. 

Buy peeled garlic cause it's annoying to peel it by yourself.

Salami/tuna sandwiches with pickle, butter, cheese and tandoori mayo taste good too and it only takes 2-3 mins to make it. 
Macaroni is also quick and white sauce can be made in literally two mins. Fry garlic in butter, add one tablespoon of flour, stir quickly, pour 100ml milk and one slice of cheese, oregano/chilli flakes and it's done. You just gotta toss the boiled macaroni in the sauce. Poha, Upma, Rice, Dal is easy to make! To begin with 

Boil noodles (not maggi) or pasta and add a curry on top.

Put mixed veggies, spices and washed rice into a bowl and pour water to the level of the rice and cook till water is evaporated and you got pulav.  Eat it with pickle or yogurt.


Buy some minced meat, sauté it with some spices, onion and any veggies, mix it with mayonnaise and use it as a spread for sandwich.

And then they say quality of Education is going down.

Plus sometimes at night for extra cash on late night deliveries that CTC is much better than what im getting rn for core electrical [deleted] Nobody wants to do ""lowly"" blue or pink collar jobs, everyone wants a cosy white collar job in India. So, there are shortage of plumbers or electricians but oversupply of teachers and engineers. and i bet the fees at that school would be exorbitant too. In the company I work, BPO Fresher starting salary is around 15K, my wife works for Education company, done M.Sc organic chemistry from distance and has teaching experience of 3 years, gets salary of 15K. And her colleageues get 19K with masters & B.Ed qualified., 

Teaching filed is underpaid.. When teachers will be paid less then for sure education will go down 1. Needs a bike

2. No opportunity for advancement which also they need to be compensated for Supply-Demand Which app/website is this? i am confused... aren't salaries of teachers even in private schools regulated by the government based on pay commission scale? to match salaries of teachers in government schools? at least that's what i have been told by my dad. maybe it only applies to delhi ncr region though. 

(i do understand that private schools cheat the system by underpaying teachers but getting them to sign on full salary slip) That's free markets for you It's coz to be a rider u need to own a vehicle and pay for the cost of fuel, whereas to be a teacher u just need to have an education My college lost 3 lecturers who were paid 10000 INR, when they asked for a raise up to 15k. Smh There is a reason why a large proportion (close to 50%) of Grade 5 students can't do many Grade 2 exercises.  

 Apparently, education is too expensive and teachers don't get paid enough. The sad, pathetic reality is this Indeed job app This is a wrong comparison. Delivery guys risk their lives on the road fighting pollution, heat and traffic and what not. Also, they get this much salary by doing overtime shifts. Even though primary school teachers are the guiding light for future leaders, even though i know they are underpaid, comparison is wrong. 

A well educated and skilled school teacher can still get a good salary at the end of the month, there are so many opportunities right now, work from home, and all. But yeah a single source of income is not enough and they will end up working more and exhausting themselves if they serve multiple platforms. पकौड़े छानो। I guess the monetary value of any job is based on its demand in the market,

Delivering door to door under hot sun, with unbearable traffic, is hardwork, i doubt many people would want to do it.

Where as educators may not be having such physical hardwork but mental work, many people might opt for this job and also online courses are becoming a trend/ preferable thing among students. So, there is that.

 Ya’ll mofos need some socialism in your life. Just do what I did if couldn't get into Engineering/Sciences/Medical/Law, etc. Correspondence Grad with 2 years of Govt.

It's another thing, I didn't get admission to any Engg or Sciences courses so had to settle whatever was available. But, after all these years and saw the value of my trade education took me all the way to where I am, I couldn't be much happier. My friends from high school spent a larger sum in getting into Engineering by way of Payment seats are not earning any way more than I am and have the same career trajectory as mine.

They're just everywhere these days.,1896,bmu870,https://i.redd.it/lltlzq3ngbx21.png,151,,galacticmastr," Question: How much money  they really  make? You know those rude delivery guys and people who steal/tamper products? Makes me wonder if it's because they are stressed out due to their low pay and hard work. What's heartbreaking is those Flipkart guys with massive backpacks. I just can't imagine traveling with that much weight on their backs. whos the last one? Illuminati? poor guys have minimal to zero accident health benefits because some smart-ass lawyers word the agreements are ""partners"" or ""agents"" After engineering one kid goes to work for IT. And another goes for delivery. RIP their backs. There should be a day in the year where we celebrate the efforts of these delivery people in our lives. They have become a very integral part of our lives in the last few years. The thing I most hate about this is how overqualified most of these people are for these jobs.
I recently was assigned to a delivery guy, who was an M.Com graduate and spoke 4 languages. Yet here he was delivering me Pav Bhaji and Thumsup. What's the delivery company in the fourth pic? what they need is a union. They are heros. Their efficiency is unbelievable Glad human beings are being employed, 15 years from now delivery will be done Robot / drones And then there are Captain Americas ... those delivery guys carrying DTH dish antennas. do you guys tip these delivery guys? i know people who order a little extra food to share with their drivers. i just give them ₹20-₹30. even then some drivers turn down the tips. 

a tip here or there doesn't make a huge difference, but if more people start tipping our delivery drivers it'd go a long way to show them our appreciation for having to deal with all the hassle that we outsource to them and so don't have to deal with anymore. Why doesn't anyone design a two wheeler that cater only to delivery guys?
Will have more capacity to carry goods and also save their backs. And they call u way before they reach ur society. What's the company being depicted in the last photograph ? To everyone saying thank yous, this is your gif

https://giphy.com/gifs/vulture-mad-men-don-draper-the-suitcase-3oEdv7Ob55JGHS3Ces I'd like to put a point in a different context, but in the same topic.

I noticed that when I order from zomato and my friend orders something too from the same restaurant. We get 2 delivery guys coming to our location from the same restaurant. Why isn't there an algorithm made that merges the orders from one restaurant to one location to a single delivery boy. This causes unnecessary traffic and congestion. Also waste of fuel These delivery bikes need to be regulated somehow.
they have no road or driving etiquettes they creat an absolutely nuisance in traffic 
there’s been a huge influx of them causing a strain on the city’s roads, we’re not equipped to deal with such a large number of bikes on the roads. They don't deliver to me. Am I in the ^bad list? One other way to look at it is our developing economy and increasing labour jobs. Do anyone have the habit of tipping those guys?. Is it okay to give them a tip or ₹10 or is it unnecessary. They are everywhere these days because they get a decent amount for doing that. So many of them won't work for it if it wasn't paying them a good wedge. I am sure they earn about 30-40. one of the employees from these companies would be able to go more in the economics of these deals. So Santa Claus is everywhere? This os ehat employment looks like Blue-collar jobs are now mostly red colored. Don't mock them. They are just jobless graduates. Many of them have high degrees like BE or MBA.
Underemployed youngsters, feel puty for them. While exiting the Metro station on my way home from work, I saw an Uber cab hit a Flipkart biker really hard. Some of these bikers drive really aggressively, even more than average Indian bikers. 😥 Nice, I suggest Uber eats is an also Santa Claus. its true.

Zomato trying to earnback the discounts with these underhanded practices.,1226,braiqf,https://i.imgur.com/Pt2MdP8.jpg,95,,wick29," Zomato Takes a percentage cut from the price of every order they provide to the restaurant. These Handling Charges are consumed only by the restaurant and Zomato gets Zero cut from this specific charge. 

Let's see

You order two items of Rs100 from Zomato 50x2=100

Handling Charges Rs10 per item         10x2=20

Taxes on the items not on handling charges 5%= 5

Delivery Charge Rs 20

&#x200B;

You paid 100+20+5+20= 145

Zomato usually takes 18% flat if they offer delivery and 10% if the order is fulfilled by the restaurant.

Zomato took 18% from the base price i.e Rs 18

So the restaurant receives 145-5-20-18=102

The restaurant has to recover the cost somehow and Zomato encourages this style because win-win for Zomato and Restaurant

Honestly, Discounts are designed to drive more orders and you almost never get a good deal. You are still spending money after a discount in fact more because the discount made you purchase the item in the first place. I don't think that this is coming from Zomato, I think that this is a Burger King charge. I just checked swiggy and it's the same there, there is an extra RS. 29 restaurant charge, and that's dispite the fact that I'm a Swiggy Super member. Swiggy..Zomato..food panda...all same shit.

Just today I found a home delivery place with a nice variety and 0 delivery charge or minimum order within 2km

If we can figure out a way to give all local business this kind of power...all food ordering would be screwed.

If any body wants to collab on such a project ...pm me I never bothered with these apps. Restaurants near our home deliver free over a certain price point. Need to recuperate those costs from all those expensive advertising campaigns lol I always knew this was gonna turn into some kind of a scam since they had this 40% offer thing going on for months together and that got me thinking. The way they are making people outsource cooking food, is gonna hurt Indians in long run. Food is dirt cheap in India if you've habit of cooking your own food. But once you start ordering food from outside on regular basis, i think it's hard to hold on to your habit of cooking. What is Chicken Whooper?  probably their way of punishing you for ordering chicken on a tuesday It may be an unpopular opinion:

Fact: Handling charges go to the Restaurant not to Zomato. 

Opinion: You are absolutely more than welcome to drive in the Heat and save that amount! 
And next time, please tip those guys, they work in pathetic conditions. Zomato or swiggy prices are higher, if you go to restaurant and check menu and still they add handling charges And also if you notice ,the prices of items are slightly higher in Zomato than in restaurants. Bookmyshow also doing that with convenience charge Dont order from Zomato. Use swiggy and get super membership. Seems bit better. r/assholedesign There is no such thing as discount. If you can't convince them, confuse them Zomato is the new Chortel? What is ""Simpl""? A new payment app? Awful practice Zomato First the delivery boys stole our food. Now it's Zomato directly stealing our money. Awesome Damn that's trashy xD Why is this the top post in my popular tab? r/assholedesign Nothing new. I usually order from the ones i personally go and eat and if i get like even 10% discount on the overall package, i use some app.
Some restaurants even reduce their quantity in the delivery and then i stop going there. I'm like f*** you Most likely a bug in their code rather than a deliberate attempt to eat money... Unless we Indians stop being lazy and go to restaurant by ourselves to buy food, we will always get cheated and scammed in the hands of such pathetic corporate tactics.",Food,2019-05-21 21:37:29
31.4% of Indian children will be stunted by 2022: report,153,c5kd15,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/314-of-indian-children-will-be-stunted-by-2022-report/article28138523.ece?homepage=true,48,,akdupakdu," that's an awful lot of a percentage. On one hand we have malnourished kids and on other we have crop spoilage because of poor/no storage facilities. It is 38.4% now according to NFHS-4. There is progress but not up to required level. Smaller people need lesser food. World Hunger solved!! /s You may not believe it but BJP banned the production of GMO crops which could produce surplus amount of crops to feed the hungry. They had some shitty 'Monsanto' excuse which is used by white nationalists. Scientists all over the world have debunked the claim that GMOs are harmful. 

https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/09/26/indias-gmo-cotton-miracle-food-crops-remain-blocked-heres/ Sometimes I think the nation is doing this on purpose.

After all, the small set of super rich needs an army of minions - nannies, cleaners, drivers, maids, gardeners etc.


PS: I meant no disrespect to the professions mentioned, they probably bring more value to society/life than my job. These were mentioned just as examples of ""low paying/low qualification criteria"" jobs. The kids need to fed more protein products, and more vegetables, along with the usual Dal-Roti/Dal-Chawal. Atleast they'll have a balanced diet.

Also, I've heard there's big arguments about using GMO crops in India. What are these GMO Crops, and what are the allegations against them, which make these peeps mad? These kids need to eat some pakodas. 0% unemployment , 0% malnutrition. One solution to all our problems. Some 50% of the adults have been stunted by 2019 and the number is likely to go up to 80% by 2024. [removed] This is modiji's way of controlling population, now that genocide card cannot be used again. People should stop having kids if they can't afford one. We are already the most overpopulated country in the world. Also Indian diet doesn't usually meet the recommended daily protein intake. So about the a third of Indians in the next 25 years will be unproductive or less productive members of society. Thanos' snap is literally happening without infinity stones. I wonder what Govt.

Which are the best countries to visit in Europe for 5D-6N?,43,c9epnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9epnc/which_are_the_best_countries_to_visit_in_europe/,52,"We do not want to rush and cover as many places as possible rather we would like to explore more of 1 or 2 countries. Especially the food and culture and also countryside living if possible.

&#x200B;

Anyone who has done a similar trip can please share their experiences. 

&#x200B;

PS - 3 guys travelling in the month of either August or September",RehneDe," Amsterdam and Switzerland. 

Hands down arguably the best places in Europe. They both are absolutely beautiful and worth a trip, out of all the countries I’ve been to in Europe, I find these 2 the most worthwhile. Switzerland is the best. Also you can try Austria . Anyways check the current weather as Europe is facing a very harsh summer now. Avoid Paris and Italy .
Switzerland is expensive by the way . If you are going to Geneva, you can visit Lyon, France just 1.5hr bus/train ride. In my opinion its better than Paris for French culture(Food/stay is cheaper than Paris).
You don't have a very popular Eiffel tower here. But I think its worth if you are nearby.

You can PM me if you want.

It's super hot here now 35C most of France has no AC. Is that the Droid from the new Star Wars movie? Chup kar ke prague chale jao... beer piyo aur chill karo.

Post on the orague sub and meet some local redditers... hit the party scene Food - Italy (my God their tomatoes and Olive oil!)    
Culture - Every country has culture  
Countryside living - Lots of places offer it. French countryside is nice. Southern France especially, lots of Europeans vacation there. Remember Cannes from Mr Bean's Holiday? All that beautiful country side was south-east France.   

I know Indians and Bollywood have a hard on for Switzerland, but I would not recommend staying there. It is a beautiful country that will take your breath away, but it'll burn your pockets at the same time. Smarter thing to do is start camp at a cheaper country like Italy or Spain, take trains or blablacar for day trips (suggesting day trips since your tenure is short) to expensive countries like CH or DE.   

Unless you're hell bent on it, don't waste time in pubs. You'll find pubs anywhere across the world - it's 4 walls with some lights and dhikchak dhikchak. You can pick up girls maybe and find a dulhan (if you're into that sappy eurotrip crap) if you're desperate.    
It's better to spend time/money to experience things that you can only experience there - food, homestays, countryside, vineyards, nude beaches, etc. Do go to bars though, you can meet interesting locals or fellow travellers. 3 guys? I do not know what is your exact preference but I'd ask you to consider Vienna, Budapest, and Prague. Culturally nice, diverse, and great for your pocket too. If you really want more country side maybe add innsbruck/Haltstatt in Austria into the mix.

&#x200B;

The reason why I suggest this, Austria has similar views as Switzerland, Vienna is awesome as a town, Budapest is both pretty and great for party (and 2.5 hours by bus from Vienna). Prague is...just visit it...you wont regret it.

&#x200B;

Also, in Europe most of these towns have night pub crawl walking tours and free walking tours, by companies like sandemann If you choose Switzerland, I have some suggestions that will save you some money. Switzerland is pretty expensive compared to other countries. Book hotels that offer free breakfast take advantage of it. Buy from the hot food bar of the two major grocery stores ""Coop"" and ""Migros"". They are usually 1/3rd of the price of eating in restaurants. 

&#x200B;

Public transportation is phenomenal in Switzerland, They will take you almost anywhere, so stay in places outside of major hubs like Interlaken & Zurich. There is significant difference in hotel prices outside of major tourist places.

&#x200B;

Look into getting a travel pass, there are two kinds, one of which you only pay half fare for any train, bus or boat journeys and another which you pay nothing other than the cost of travel pass. Switzerland, I took a rental car from geneva to zurich and back exploring little villages and towns along the way. You can also drive through the alpine passes(furka pass being a good one) during this time of the year. 3 guys? Bachelors? Apply for a visa before you make any bookings at all. 

Back in 2016, we planned a 2 weeks visit. The four of us, me, my wife and 2 of my bachelor friends, applied for Schnegen visa together. My wife and I got the visa, my friends didn't. Got rejected upon reapplication too. Both have a stable job, family ties to India, the documentation was complete, but they just didn't get the visa. If you're not really into partying and love road trips you can try Iceland. It's really beautiful and you might get to see Northern lights. On a side note, is a 1.5 lakh Europe trip possible if I stay at hostels and stuff? I feel European countries can be sorted by 'gotta see' rating. If you go to Europe and return seeing Lucerne - you sort of have not really experienced Europe per se.

1. Italy - Rome + Vatican city
2. France - Paris
3. Turkey - Istanbul
4. UK - London
5. Spain - Barcelona
6. Netherlands - Amsterdam
7. ....
8. ....

.....Switzerland - Beautiful alps.. and that is sorta where it ends. (Xenophobic Swiss)

&#x200B;

I strongly recommend the top two.  2 days in Paris + 3 days in Rome.

Go to Paris, enjoy the Eiffel tower, the sandwiches, walk along seine, walk on the Champs-Elysees, the Louvre...

Early morning flight to Rome ($50)

Marvel at the chaotic traffic, the old historic architecture mixed with modern malls, the colosseum, the Trevi fountain, real gelato, pizza, sandwiches, Italians who wave their hands all over... the outdoor cafes in the evening, the squares with musicians.. and of course a guided tour of the Vatican ... Postpone the trip to October, go to Germany, attend the Oktoberfest, then head to Amsterdam. italia Oktoberfest in Munich starts late September. If you do that, Austria and Czech republic are pretty close. And Bavarian Alps is breathtakingly beautiful. This really depends a lot on your interests and budget, but my personal recommendation, if you're interested in food and countryside living, I highly recommend Italy. Spend one day in Rome to see some of the usual tourist sites, and then head to the countryside.  

Is it the most famous and most prettiest part of Europe? Probably not (but its still damn pretty). But it sounds like what you're looking for. I'd recommend the Basque Country (Pais Vasco). It's often overlooked by non-European tourists - indeed, you won't find the usual Chinese or American tour group plodding around as you will in the likes of Madrid, Barcelona, Lisboa, Marseille, Roma, Firenze, Munchen etc.

I'm just back from 3.5 days cycling in the region: Biarritz - Hendaye - Donostia - Amorebieta - Gernika - Bermeo - Bilbao - Llodio - Vitoria-Gasteiz - Durango.

The whole area is great for mountain biking and road cycling - lots of hills and some descent col-type descents - particularly just north of Bilbao and south of Durango. The coast from Hendaye down to Donostia hosts a decent number of surfing competitions. The sunset over San Jan de Gaztelugatze is fairly unbeatable too. Regards food, Donostia (also known as ""San Sebastian"") has the *highest* number of Michelin-starred restaurants per capita of any city on the planet (16 at present) - a great mix of seafood as well as produce from the interior. Snacks such as pintxos and txapoli are worth a try in the early evening. Nightlife often continues deep into the early morning (3am+). You'll also notice there's a real hybrid of cultures - Basque mixed with French and Spanish influences. Street signs are often bi- (if not trilingual) and there's a decent number of art museums across the region too (the most famous being the Guggenheim and Bellas Artes in Bilbao). Once you go out of the main towns you'll often see many signs advocating for independence for Euskara (the Basque region). If you're cycling it's also relatively easy to stick your bike on the trains (Euskotren, Cercanias, TER, though possibly you might need a reservation with Renfe). I stayed in some top-quality Airbnbs (5\* superhosts) and spent less than €85 all-in for 3 nights in 3 separate cities (Anglet, Bilbao, Vitoria-Gasteiz), and this is pretty close to peak-season.

&#x200B;

Regards some of the other suggestions on the thread: Amsterdam (having lived there) is a *massive* tourist trap (in the ""grachtengordel"" - i.e. the canal region). The accommodation is massively overpriced. The only Airbnbs are quite a way out from the centre. The quality of food and drink outside supermarkets is very poor given what you are being charged. The place attracts some of the most clueless tourists from outside Europe - really, if they want drugs and hookers there are plenty of other cities which offer similar and much more affordable prices - just that those tourists generally haven't heard of them. Dutch cuisine is considered some of the most unappetizing food on the continent - take a random city in say, Finland and then compare the number of clients a Greek restaurant receives compared to say a Dutch one, and you'll see my point. And as for the landscape - it's pretty flat and boring, since much of the land has been reclaimed from the sea (in the case of Flevoland, barely a century ago). Switzerland is a bit more interesting as a quadrilingual country, particularly with regards to the landscape - but again, it's massively overpriced and you might as well head over to the Dolomiti (Italian Alps), Julianski (Slovenian Alps) or even Franche-Comte for better value. I would not recommend going to Europe. Why spend your money in a place that is increasingly nationalistic and racist. Keep it in Asia.",Food,2019-07-05 19:06:31

1. Cleared my 2 home loans before I moved.
2. Bought a car with cash. No loan
3. Moved to smaller city where monthly expense is less than 30000
4. I get rent from 1 house in Blore. I live in my own house in my smaller city.
5. I had ~70 l in shares. Invested 20l in friends business. It's been 3 years. Getting returns now. I invest keeping in mind that I lose the entire amount.
6. Bought some plot for 8 l, so that it can be used for kids education in future.
7. Rotating 10 l at 18% interest.
8. Interest + house rent runs my house.
9. Wife joined as teacher as she could not sit idle.
10. I did freelancing for 2years when I returned. But it was not worth as I had challenges doing from a smaller city.
11. I drop and pick my kid to school, help in his homework, eat, read books, do crosswords, spend 2hrs with friends (8-10pm), do some social service etc. Basically a house husband now.
12. Haven't touched a laptop since 18 months.
13. It takes 15 minutes from one end of city to another end. 5 minutes to outskirts.
14. City has 1 mall and an Inox. When we go to bigger city we go to KFC, mc Donald's, chilies etc

You need to adapt and find fun.

I am 38 years now. It is difficult to answer such questions because what a person wants, their cultural orientation, their economic status, their stage in life, feedback from their immediate family and friends, what they think is a good life, etc. vary greatly. 

There are 20 such knobs and you can get to any answer you want by tuning them and you could end up with both great and poor results in either country.

Any internet forum is not a great source of such inputs since you have no idea who is giving them. You might agree with what someone is saying but if you meet them in person you might throw out everything they mentioned.

A better model is to talk to people you have met so you can do a diff between their choice vs. yours and arrive at a qualified input.

What you don't want is a 13 year old giving you advice on how bringing his wife and kids back home was the most difficult thing he has ever done. I grew up in the US, moved back to India in my late teens, and then moved right back to the US. 

My parents moved back for good. So did a cousin of mine. She grew up in the US and then lived in Oz, came back to the US, met an Indian guy who was working in the US, and then moved to India with him. She loves it back in India. And I have a couple of friends who moved back as well.

In my view, it depends on how you identify yourself. I see myself as culturally an American of Indian origin, so I really struggled back in India. My friends who had grown up in India and then went back found it a lot easier. Same with my parents, who had a lot of their friends and family back in India. I also remember standing out a lot because of my accent and my mannerisms (arguably, kids are meaner than adults).

Secondly, things like your career and your aspirations play a role. I honestly have enjoyed the flexibility of jumping around various careers and I don't think that would have been possible in India. My friends who love tech or love finance have done great. I also think India has a ton of great opportunities now and it's a great time to make a difference.

Three, quality of life. It's an interesting mix. If you have a great job and good income, you could live like a king in India. Have someone drive you around, domestic help to cook and clean, much more affordable etc. But on the other hand, everyday Western amenities would be surprisingly hard. Getting anywhere would be hard, driving is nuts, lots of pollution, not exactly clean, and it's hard if you have dietary restrictions. But overall, if you're willing to live in a bubble, it'll be incredible and unparalleled.

Four, are you single or married? Western style dating is hard. A good friend who grew up in India moved back after 15 years. He's really struggling with dating. He's fellow dark South Indian guy and unsurprisingly, he's really struggling to date. On the other hand, I have a friend who's a white woman from Wisconsin and moved to Mumbai and met her French boyfriend there. But I think if you have kids and a family back in India, it's a no-brainer.

Five, if you like activities, it maybe a bit harder in India. There's great stuff for families but if you like to go rock climbing or kayaking or sailing or what have you, it'll be much harder. On the other hand, if you enjoy clothes and jewelry and great Indian food and spending time with friends and family, India would be incredible. 

Finally, food and drink. India is surprisingly conservative when it comes to alcohol. It's really hard to get a good drink with your meal at most places. While India has a lot of great food, and even other cuisines, they all tend to be very Indianized. I have a chili allergy so I can't eat spicy food at all but even oats and Italian food in India are spicy!!! Allergies aren't well respected in general. Salads are not a thing and fake meat isn't common. Even with real meat, getting a good steak or getting bacon is really hard. So if you like traditional Indian food then you'll have a blast. If not, it maybe a bit harder. For me, this was the hardest. I don't eat a lot of carbs or spice and anything with milk gives me the runs. So I found it really hard. After a while of eating all those carbs and curries, I really wanted a fresh salad but even if you made one, getting salad dressings are hard. But I'm sure it's changed these days.

The are probably other reasons as well. At the end of the day, it also comes down to where you're living and whether you think you have the ability to go back if you didn't like India. Having lived and worked around the world now, I much prefer somewhere like Melbourne which has a much higher standard of living. [deleted] How much money you need to survive is all upto your lifestyle.

Before I moved back I didn’t have much cash but had invested in real estate. The rent money kept me afloat till I was able to settle again. Mixed... Except struggle with lack of social circle, most of the things are better. The years in Vaterland. I am also moving back after 9 years. Looking forward for it. My parents moved back (I’m in the process of moving back abroad) but keeping them busy is a challenge. My dad spends time with his college buddies but my mom finds it harder to socialise. YMMV I suppose. Gulhind here. Girls pay you a lot more attention, guys get jealous af and more malicious, and teachers have preformed ideas about how you secured admission into the college. 

Life's smooth however. My dad has lots of FDs that generate a lot of interest and he is now retired. I am glad he raised me in such a way that I don't splurge or look down on those less fortunate.

I used to be so scared of having tea after fish pakora. I am eating chicken as normal. Nothing bad as happened till now. Buy from a retail shop that keeps meat frozen from the beginning, or if you have a proper butcher buy freshly cut chicken. might be a good idea to avoid steam momos type dishes. but properly cooked chicken should be fine. eating out is always going to have its risks. i have had food poisoning at restaurants that are very popular so there was little chance of having stale food. these days i mostly order from a local restaurant owned by a guy who i have came to know personally because of frequent ordering. i have been to the kitchen. have seen their deep freezer. has been working fine so far!

The chances of microbes and diseases speading is high during the monsoon, also after the first wave of the monsoon season many chicken die while being transported, your maa is kinda right. Yes it is very humid during monsoons Someone from med background here. 

First of all,  it is true that monsoons does have higher rate of infection.  This is simply because moisture and ambient temperature ( 30-40)  are good source for organisms to grow which can range from bacteria,  fungi etc.  After heating as well,  some microorganisms may survive.  

BUT!! 

It doesn't mean you will necessarily get the infection lol.  It depends on the place itself.  Unhygienic place with dirty water,  no sanitation will lead to higher chances of infection no matter what the season is.  So like any intelligent non vegetarian,  don't eat those 30rs chicken stuff.  Not good. 

Chicken( or any non veg) from a hygienic restaurant is completely fine.  Again also depends on your immunity in case you do eat a wrong meat.  So yeah,  spend it well if you want to eat it. 

Your mom pretty much is basing her opinion by thinking all restaurant have filthy areas for preparation of chicken.  Which is not true obviously. Honestly, it's generally a bad idea to eat meat in India during summers, especially from small shops/restaurants that don't always have proper refrigeration. Meat spoils quickly in this heat. Throw in power cuts and it's a recipe for getting food poisoning They are called *old wives tales* for a reason. They are *old*, as in not relevant in the modern age with more advanced technology, they are from *wives* as in housewives who are not exactly known for conducting scientific research on these topics, and *tales* as in just a bunch of stories or myths. Since no one here mentioned  colistin

It is used to fatten up chicken Mostly in India and China.

 it's an antibiotic of last resort and may cause antibiotic resistance I just wanna tell you the type of microorganism you congest while eating dead flesh, that makes you sick, so eating meat in any season isn't good. Although she's right eating it in Monsoon can be the most dangerous season.",Food,2019-07-01 15:31:04
After living in Bombay for 17+ years I visited Delhi for the first time and there are some difference I noticed. Let me know my impression are way too off.,217,bt64df,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bt64df/after_living_in_bombay_for_17_years_i_visited/,165,"1) Roads, so much better! 

2) Metro >> Local Trains 

3)Delhi is so much spacious, if you know what I mean (except chandni chowk, ofcourse) 

4) People are way too rude unnecessarily, from your information desk at the airport to your regular paani puri wala (Gol gappe, Yeah that's one too 😂) 

5) I never thought I'll ever say this, but Mumbai was so good at following traffic rules comparatively.

Let me know if some of my impression are way too off, after all it was a 1 day trip.


Edit: I forgot to add one thing, no auto wala goes by the meter lol. When asked “bhai meter kya hota hai"" (T: Bro, is there a thing called meter?)",notaredditor_," Going to Mumbai in a few days, will update. Been in Delhi all my life. I dread the first three changes. Bang on about all points. This comes from a Delhite settled in Mumbai for 15 years Mumbai is way more safer for girls. In mumbai you’ll see girls wearing mini skirts entering into kaali peeli taxis alone at 1:00 am at night. Not sure if Delhi girls can do that. Also cat calling in much more common in Delhi than Mumbai. One Important question. How the food? Street Food what would you choose Mumbai or Delhi? You're right about most of it. Move a few kilometers into Haryana however, and you'll be in a Gangs of Wasseypur type of situation.
About the roads, their quality near the parliament area makes me think of Isle of Man TT style road races happening on them whenever I'm travelling there. Pollution. Delhi is a toxic gas chamber And most of the Delhi guys aren't aware who their father is - the most common dialogue - ""Tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai?"" 

How the hell would I know! 🤣 “If” my impressions** (typo in title) Delhi is very green, especially south delhi. There are park after park in Saket and Hauz Khas. 

The amount of history everywhere is also surprising. Like in the middle of a residential area in Mehrauli, you'll have a 400 year old monument

Houses in Delhi are also so much bigger. My 2 bedroom house is literally twice the size of my brother's 2 bedroom house in Mumbai

I'm not the biggest fan of Delhi, but if you discount the pollution, Delhi is easily the most livable of all the major metros. Bangalore is way too tiny for its population, Mumbai is too cramped, and Kolkata is just too filthy and poor (no idea about Chennai since I've never been there) Are Bombay people kinder than Delhi people??? You came from an organically evolved city to a top-down constructed one. While you get all the benefits of infrastructure, you will find the quality of people is bad and there is no harmony among them. This post reminds me of Abhishek Upmanyu's Bombay-Delhi jokes. Love that guy. \- I won't be too hasty about point #5, I'll conceded that traffic cops are more strict in Mumbai but otherwise there is little to differentiate between the two.

\- Bang on about autos in Delhi, they'll never run by the meter. It's better to take an Uber.

\- You hadn't mentioned so let me add, unless you are a hardcore seafood addict, Delhi food scene is far far ahead of any other metro. Right from street food to fine dining. I rule out Delhi as a good place to live in because of two factors

1. Unsafe for women

2. Almost unbreathable during winter

Otherwise, I love Delhi's food and metro. These are two areas where Delhi does better than every other city in India. All true. You scored 100/100 People in Delhi take things for granted. I recently was coming back from Mussoorie. The roads are very narrow. So there can only be two lines for vehicles , one for going uphill and one for going downhill. The lane for traffic going up is always busy as you reach near  Mussoorie. But this one guy broke his lane from way back and got stuck in front of our bus which was going downhill  and instead of making way for the bus he started arguing with the local who tried solve the situation. The car had a  number plate of Delhi.
 
The bus driver literally said this thing"" abe hatao isko... pata nhi kaha se aa jaate hai ye delhi waale saari road to inke baap ki hai"". As a delhi-ite here who's been living in Mumbai for the past 7 years,it is like going to wasseypur when I visit family back home now i am from mumbai and now in delhi ,

weather is worst in winters , in summers coolers are great.

local metro transport is the best, bus services are below avg.

&#x200B;

street food is garbage both in diversity and flavor.

&#x200B;

people are by far the worst & even tho they are more left leaning than us politically. The middle class are too arrogant and show off. and cast pride is more visible.

&#x200B;

in total standard of living and ease of living in bad (not me but gov statics) Mumbai anytime 😁🤘 There's no comparison between Mumbai locals and Delhi metro. While locals are the lifeline of Mumbai, they're just too old, too unsafe, and too crowded. They cannot be called a modern public transportation network. That said, Mumbai has gone in overdrive in metro construction in last few years. In here before everyone starts saying *women can't go out at X hour of night* without living here. Make sure to keep a Talwaar with you in Metros >Edit: I forgot to add one thing, no auto wala goes by the meter lol. When asked “bhai meter kya hota hai"" (T: Bro, is there a thing called meter?)

Here I have to add a disclaimer. Actually they do it because not many people travel using autos. Ola/Uber Share/Pool cost same or even lesser than autos so we all travel by **cabs** and even Micro  cab rides are not that costly. Hahahah. On point, all of those. Bombay people = way more grounded and less snobbish than Delhi. Delhi = aggressive, hostile. Bombay = sorry boss, move on. Delhi metro is miles ahead of Bombay local trains. And yeah there is no such thing as a meter here. 

&#x200B;

on behalf of delhi apologies for the rudeness. I miss Bombay. >I forgot to add one thing, no auto wala goes by the meter lol. When asked “bhai meter kya hota hai"" (T: Bro, is there a thing called meter?)

in north autos go by the market price. how much are you willing to pay? 


in Mumbai what Shiv Sena has done is used the auto union as their own fiefdom. you just can't buy an auto and start driving. in the north more or less you can. Don't agree to point 4 completely. Delhi people find Mumbai people rude and vice versa. I have got mixed experience in both locations. Wow, can't believe how Delhi has been stereotyped so much to be unsafe for women based on few media reports. Few incidents have happened here, I won't deny that, but just going through r/India any given day will provide you more such incidents coming from everywhere in India. Many of my friends go at night without facing any problems. Stop talking shit without living here. So much misinformation. >4) People are way too rude unnecessarily, from your information desk at the airport to your regular paani puri wala (Gol gappe, Yeah that's one too 😂) 

strange I thought Mumbai was very rude. 

but I understand your confusion in the north we talk a certain way that makes us seem rude. my client even complained to me once about this. it is is just the way we talk. > 2) Metro >> Local Trains 


My friend in bombay goes to gym by local train. Its a few staions up for him. I can imagine doing that by metro. If you could read properly and knew your geography, I mentioned ‘not as humid’ (as compared to Chennai/ Mumbai >4) People are way too rude unnecessarily, from your information desk at the airport to your regular paani puri wala (Gol gappe, Yeah that's one too 😂) 

We aren't rude, we just can't talk with BC/MC. Doesn't feel like we are talking if we don't talk like that. It's become part of our dialect. Pretty much all are true. 4) is fairly subjective. 5) is not always true but I'll give u that. True. >Metro >> Local Trains

Why are Karnataka’s schoolchildren unhappy with the mid-day meal? Iskcon’s Akshaya Patra Foundation refuses to add onion or garlic to the meals it provides even though the children crave the familiar taste,181,bvizyl,https://www.thehindu.com/society/why-are-karnatakas-schoolchildren-unhappy-with-the-mid-day-meal/article27378176.ece,126,,madamplease," Its a catch 22 situation. 

While other vendors are giving below par quality (sometimes harmful) meals to children - these people are giving good quality (because of their beliefs) but not including onions and garlic. 

Can we not have some ethical agencies which does both?

> When asked if the government was being partial to APF, Umashankar denied it. “Who is going to serve such a huge number of children if we cancel this contract?” he said. “There are logistical issues; overnight, we cannot build kitchens and hire cooks. The administration cannot function on the basis of philosophical arguments. I’ve told these activists directly — they have their heads in the clouds. I live on earth.”

If you ignore his tone here - he has a valid point. The only reason APF keeps getting contract is because they are performing well and meeting the scale. > In February 2019, NIN gave its formal nod to APF’s menu and said: “The nutritive values of menus with ingredients used in the mentioned amounts certainly meet and often exceed the prescribed energy (Kcal) and protein requirements prescribed by MHRD (Ministry of Human Resource Development) for the MDM.”

Seems like right nutritional value is met... If kids prefer meat, they could skip this meal as they do, according to the article My wedding was in a ISKCON TEMPLE.yes. ironic that I'm an athiest. But I take don't know why they don't like onion and garlic

Also their food was really good. Didn't realise that it was without onion & garlic It is what it is... APF is giving high quality food at reasonable cost with some restrictions. Onion and garlic are great but flavor can be achieved without them and iskcon Cooks do that. Seems like much Ado about nothing

I'm willing to bet that if there was another org that was serving food with meat and eggs and all that, there would have been voices saying that there's no options for vegetarians

It is difficult to reach a large scale when you try to accommodate everyone's preferences Atleast it is better quality than what they would be getting out of government run kitchens.

Is the government even prepared to provide food to so many childrens while maintaining the same standards.The answer is NO. Time for a Tadka service. An NGO that just provides onion and garlic tadka to this food and we are set. Let Iskon give their food (as they are cheap & efficient) - because that is all the state can afford.

People who are complaining can just deliver supplements to the form of beef, onion, pork etc. I have couple of questions 


Does the food have all the nutritional value recommended? 

Does the food taste good??

Is it hygienic and of good quality?

Is this the cheapest bid?

If answers to all of the above questions are yes , then I dont see any problem My question is off topic, but what happened to the people who served poisonous mid-day meal in bihar some time back? Jees what a bunch of ungrateful kids. They get really good food, fresh and nutritious food. But do these kids want to spoil  themselves. Today its onion tomorrow they may say add maggie and burgers. What's the problem with onion and garlic? Anybody can explain? It's not like they are feeding meat to vegetarians. Onion and garlic have lots of  benefits. Why would one single out two vegetables out of children's diet citing stupid reasons. Which idiot approved of this. About time children's diet at government schools should be written by dieticians and nutrition experts and not some idiot in a company who doesn't know shit about nutrition.  Some religions have traditions where they don't allow people to eat any crop that grows underground like potato/onion because it kills insects & microorganisms when they are uprooted. Doesn't every crop kills them because most of plants that grow outside are also uprooted once they are reaped? Before going into the taste of food which is quite subjective people don't realise that the places where mid day meals schemes are operated are some of the poorest regions in India. Think about it for a second, why do they need food to lure kids into these schools? I agree it should taste good too but what people don't realise is how bad food provided to these can be without regulations. 

In my state a few years ago there were multiple reports of lizards, cockroaches being found in food. Kids were admitted to hospitals coz of food poisoning. In some instances the cooks had to make do with as less as half the ration because rest was unusable. I have seen kids who had to drink just the rice water with salt and eat the rice for lunch. And they did that because that was the only meal they could get. 

APF provides food in many states of the country. I'm no fan of isckon and have heard worse things from friends and family who used to once blindly follow them without realising the amount of brainwashing they do. But sadly, they're providing these meals that are cost effective, on a large scale, cooked according to standards and nutritious value. I would been more than happy if we could have accomodated all kinds of food to suit the children's palate but we need to look at ground realities first. The food is provided free of cost coz of poverty. Unless that is tackled nothing much is going to change. APF should be thrown out. Onion, garlic, eggs and meat should be part of the children's diet. 80 percent of Karnataka has no  issues with a non vegetarian diet. Isn't this a case of minority appeasement?And this minority very likely doesn't attend the schools where mid day meals are served. Yet they decide what everyone else gets to eat. So in our desire to please imaginary gods we will keep those unhappy who are right here on earth and as close to innocence as possible (or anyone for that matter). Bhagwan ko prasad chadhayo bachche jayen bhaad mein. 

Jo sattvicta ka dhol peetthe hain vo hi zyada tamasic hote hain on imposing their choices on others. A nonvegetarian will not force others to eat non-veg, but a vegetarian sure will. What happens when religion mixes with poverty.
If Christians or Muslims enforce a diet, will India keep quiet? First, it is Hindi imposition and now they want to push their bland vegetarian food onto the Shudras and Dalits. There will be a violent reaction if BJP plays with language and food culture down south. We are a non vegetarian people. Why give Contract to these ISKCON chutiyas in the first place! If you don't see a problem APF deciding the menu, think a Christian missionary or Muslim org coming up as a vendor with their own very tasty and nutritious menu. After all, kids are made vegetarians by their parents, they will not have any problem eating rich proteins at school.

Many food delivery operators and restaurants are delivering piping-hot food in these packets. Are they food safe and what are they made of?,199,baqs43,https://i.imgur.com/wHISEzc.jpg,41,,rajeevist," Maylar is actually safe for food storage. So, no worries.

This is from University of California:
""PET or PETE (Polyethylene terephthalate) laminate pouches are excellent food containers. PETE is a food-grade plastic with no known toxicities. Sometimes they are referred to as “mylar bags”. This type of foil dramatically reduces the transmission of oxygen and moisture through the film. To store DRY food, use oxygen absorbers and a vacuum heat seal."" 
(site: http://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=18457) Yes its totally safe.  Its like tetra packaging but only thin.  It has 2 plastic layers and a aluminium layer in between Not every packet is safe only the good and reputed  restaurants are investing in packaging of food otherwise small ones are just using packs made from cheaper materials available at lower cost in market. i doubt this is mylar. just silver coloured plastic bags.  It is only the outside of the bag which has a metallic look. The inner side is white and *looks like* plastic and, *to my untrained eyes, appears to be worse* than the thicker grade transparent plastic bags they used to send food in before the plastic ban.

The ones that we get here in Pune, look like [this](https://www.amazon.in/Aluminium-Multipurpose-Packaging-Available-Quantities/dp/B07P2ND7DS). Click on the third picture to see the inside of the bag.

I have the exact same concern as the OP each time I order food. End result, I order from outside much lesser lately. It is very harmful to health - try to avoid these toxic silver coloured mylar lookalikes. I am poor but somebody give this guy a gold. This deserves it. I believe its a type of aluminium foil... It is aluminium foil. Many of the restaurants have started to use this after the recent plastic ban enforced by the govt. 

It is safe and similar to using a foil container or foil sheet to wrap the food. 

If restaurants go for other modes of packaging then it sometimes end up costing more than the food price itself. 

&#x200B; What about some of the black boxes with transparent cover? Is it safe?  I have seen restaurants asking people to get their own containers for take home food.

The hall was crowded with so many sad faces and most of these people belongs to the hard-working section of our society. It's very disheartening. I wanna do something about this, but I don't really know the root cause of the problem. Is it something about our lifestyle or food habits? What is it?",ayushagg31," Poverty doesn't grant a great lifestyle. You forget that we have a very bad hospital to population ratio. 

When there aren't enough hospitals the available ones will be crowded I think it’s a combination of air pollution, mental stress and poor dietary habits.
Kids and elders have it even worse because of lower immunity:( Pollution.  
Some 14 or 15 of the top 20 most polluted cities in the world are in India, and most of them from the north. Poor hygiene, allergens, pollution, like so many reasons! >The hall was crowded with so many sad faces

I would be sad too if I was sick and in a hospital Also a lot of young people, including I myself, wear glasses. And I don't think it is just north India; it looks like a pan-india phenomen. For instance, in Kerala, healthcare, especially in the private sector, is a thriving business and there is no dearth of patients in the near foreseeable future. Certain disease causing micro-organisms are active in Tropical climate like ours.

Too much crowding makes India's population (especially urban) ripe for contagious diseases. Living in North India there are plenty of reasons I can think so first of all , adulterated food , even fruits and vegetables have lost their previous taste and have more and more been grown with harmful pesticides and insecticides ... 

Second, would be the people's mindset , oh you got a cold ? Just lay in bed for a few days you will get better ! 
Accha 1 hafta ho gya bimaar hote hote? Le haldi Wala dudh pile !

Following this many people take harmful Indian remedies instead of just visiting a doctor. 

3rd , air pollution as you know , it causes asthma and various other lung related diseases , I myself got bronchitis as a child 

4th open gutters , lack of hygiene in some parts . 

Feel free to add on Our jobs are way too stressful.

Our lives are invested beyond sense into constantly gathering stuff for social status.

Our diet does not really change as per the seasons. It is very unhealthy.

And lastly, we are a very insecure country. Our governance, national infrastructure, business houses, jobs, education, medicine, etc. does not really give you any comfort.

This has had a very negative effect on our collective psyche, which is percolating throughout the country. 

The entire country is like an organism, which is getting more and more rotten from within. 1. Living conditions. India is a backward country. Open sewers, unfinished construction, all kinds of shit on roads, no serious regulations on food, air pollution etc. 
2. Terrible nutrition. High in carbohydrates and fats (roti, rice and ghee/oil) and extremely low in protein (the major source is dal which is always a side).
3. Lack of exercise. What is the life of an average Indian? Eat, job, sleep, repeat; and most middle class men work clerical jobs so there's not much activity. While it could be true, You are making a gross generalization of event you witnessed which wouldn't even necessarily imply what you are understanding by it bro You just have a weak immunity, or may be you had too many antibiotics in your childhood! I am from Himachal, last time i got sick was in 2015, The butter and cream I have always thought that this can be traced back to British rule in India. I could be grossly wrong, but a lot of our ancestors in those days were starved, dehydrated, etc, and those poor genes have been passed down to us over time leading to poor immunity Over reliance on medication since childhood for silly things like cold, fever, cough, ulcers.. things that a healthy immune system is more than capable of solving on its own. People eat medicines line candy and hence they never let the immune system develop.

The immune system becomes stronger over time by learning from its previous encounters with bacteria, etc and keeps correcting itself and improvises over the course of your life. We are suppressing the growth of our immune if we take hard medication and don't let it do is job. It simply never is able to learn.

Also we have terrible food and diet. Just eat simple cooked vegetables, dal, protein, etc. The obscene amount of sugar we intake is scary. I hate the new generation, we simply moved away from bars to these unhealthy fancy milkshakes and desert places. Pretty sure that obscene amount of sugar harms you a lot more than what two beers over a weekend would.

The food outside is a joke. Too much junk, too much sugar and very little nutritional value. Even at home we do the same. Parathas, gulab jamuns, etc. That's not good. Also obesity doubly slams your immunity as it's causes of plenty more problems.

Immunity is not that difficult. Eat healthy, eat simple (boiled, cooked in good healthy oils, eat proteins like soya, egg) and stop eating random non veg food. The way the chickens are grown it's not healthy anymore. Avoid chicken unless you can find some desi ass kala murga, not those fat obese ones with broken legs pumped with steroids to grow.

Also fuck this obsession with milk. You don't need milk in everything. Some things like paneer, curd are healthy but milk in itself is intended for a calf or newborn. There isn't much there for a fully grown adult.

Good doet, lesser pills, more fruits and vegetables (preferably boiled) and enough protein is plenty too keep your immunity in check.

I haven't eaten a pill in 4+ years and never gotten sick beyond the simple cold once a year or so and gone within a week. Perfectly healthy and no tummy. It's not that difficult really.

Please don't confuse this for anti vaccination. Please give your kids all the vaccination. They need it for a healthy future. But stop eating Crocin for a fever is my point. Fever hapoens because your immune system raises temperature to create an inhospitable environment for the intruders, bacteria, etc. While the higher temperatures might feel uncomfortable, they are your immune response to the threat. It's not wise to suppress it needlessly.

Same with cold, we get cough because our immunity cells and bacteria are dying trying to fight each other in a full fledged war and the cough is one way to dispose their bodies and also to create an inhospitable environment for them. Again, while uncomfortable it's your body's natural immune response and is a good sign.

Just let the immune system do it's goddamn job, lol. It tries, it usually wins and it learns from its previous encounters. Of course that's grossly oversimplifying things but our body is designed pretty well for most common problems. Don't let these money digging profit minded pharma people trick you into thinking otherwise. No, you don't need 20+ medicines for that cold. Rest and drink water and you'll be fine.

Ever wondered why Homeopathy is so popular even when it's a sham? Because it enforce strict rules which contribute to your building your immunity and the medicines are of course just water diluted in more water, lol. People who claim homeopathy worked for them don't realise that it's their immunity doing it all along. It becomes a problem when they take homeopathic treatment for things which are serious and should be cured with traditional medication as science found. Are you saying that hospitals in other parts of the country are largely empty or something? No idea why you make that assumption lol. Bullshit Our weakened immunity; Reasons being our over dependence of Pills and Tablets, fucks-up the immunity... 

Eating carbs is harmful, but thats partially true, Simple vs. Complex carbs... Our meal traditionally gives us lots of Complex Carbs, for protein vegetarians do lack certain great sources, but Pulses pound for pound are the best protein sources, when eaten with grains; they complement each other and complete the amino acid profile.

Now for Fats, certain fats are great, most of them what we eat readily are the bad ones... Momos accompanied with Mayo... Just see what Mayo is made up of... And the rampant Egg Butter main Sandwiches and such alarming quantities of so called butter, thats actually Margarine basically spreadable Vegetable oil butter... Sells for 100Rs. A kilo... clogs up arteries ...

Moderation is key... We came well off from the deadly diseases that wreaked havoc on or forefathers... But along the way we created our on diseases. Most Indians lack Vitamin D, and that's in a tropical country such as ours... 

We eat almost 10-12 teaspoons of sugar daily... Think of eating a whole sugarcane with your own teeth and feel the pain.

Seasonal Fruits that are supposed to be eaten once or twice a week, we eat almost everyday... 

Give your body a chance to repair itself... it is a complex machinery that can have certain tolerances...

Traditionally few or our food habits were excellent... Use of turmeric, peppers, cumin, tamarind, western countries are researching them and we are forgetting what our forefathers gave us. Germs can travel easy and mutate easy among so many people. It is the product of our population and bad sanitation. High population, low amount of doctors and hospitals, poor waste collection and disposal, pollution It's the water I bet. And bad hygiene. Stop eating carbs. 40% of your bodily problems will disappear in itself. Filth mostly. Poor sanitation, open sewers, open garbage dumps, too many people so communicable diseases spread quickly, antibiotic resistant bacteria",Food,2019-06-28 16:43:51

What is your opinion on cloud kitchens?,54,cbx74q,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cbx74q/what_is_your_opinion_on_cloud_kitchens/,25,"So, recently my Dad told me that a lot of the restaurants on Swiggy are actually part of Swiggy's 'Cloud Kitchen' system wherein, the restaurants aren't actually dine-in places and are maintained entirely by Swiggy. It also turns out that lot of these ""cloud kitchens"" aren't really maintained all that well and because they don't have a dine-in option, you don't really know how the quality control is.

This seems like a really bad idea and I've actually decided to stop ordering from places I haven't been to personally.

What do you guys think?",Satahdi," I have worked with swiggy .. let me tell you about my experience .. forget the cloud kitchen, 99% of restaurants are shit .. they WILL use whatever shit they can to cut the cost .. swiggy does not helps either.. they take away nearly 28% off per order .. thus to get the profit, these restaurants have degraded their foods to such an extent one can't even fathom .. now my job was to supervise the photography of food in few major cities of UP .. I myself have done over 100 shoots personally .. leaving Hyatt regency in Lucknow, I've not seen a single restaurant who would nof do such gross shit, that made me give up on eating outside or even ordering. Now coming to your question of cloud kitchen.. these are a cocktail of poor hygiene with bad economic choices .. basically these people are lured into to by let's say a thousand views or visits to their restaurant on the app in exchange of a sum of money .. sales managers get monthly target, these sales managers have a specific area in a city .. and they literally just fool owners about these ""hits""  .. these assholes would do anything to match with their targets and get incentives..  now if you just open a restaurant in an app, and then go back, it counts as a hit. More over 'allegedly', swiggy has guys back in Bangalore to complete these hit targets .. and thus little to no revenue comes out of these investments .. hence this creates a vicious cycle where only customer has to lose.. they will cut down to shitty oil, low quality or dead meat, etc... To come up with a good return per order .. I often say that this zomato and swiggy thing, has degraded quality of food so much that you can't even imagine. Also so many tom dick and harrys are now opening these cloud kitchens in remote locations solely relying on these services for profit .. I have seen shit fall onto the ground, and then they packed it up and served to a customer later on .. one cloud kitchen in gorakhpur, had literally a toilet seat in the kitchen .. when a shoot takes place, 15 to 25 items are shot .. these are then kept indefinitely until an order comes and they heat it back again and dispatch .. my personal advice, never order online from anywhere via anything .. only outlet who are genuine with their quality are domino's and other multinational chains who have to live up to the reputation. I have seen from nobody to well known outlets and all of them disgusted me. These cloud kitchens have absolutely no accountability.. when confronted, they'll show the fassai licence which can be obtained how? You may well guess. The majority of restaurants listed on swiggy are not cloud kitchens. A few seconds of research is enough to find out whether they have a dine-in option or not. Not ordering from places you've never been is completely pointless. >I've actually decided to stop ordering from places I haven't been to personally.

That's what I do.

I do check zomato for restaurant photos.

I ordered from a cloud kitchen once. Didn't like the food at all. Hence stopped ordering from cloud kitchens. i used to order a lot from freshmenu which i guess is a good example of a cloud kitchen? it was great in early days. later it was shit. i guess they grew too fast and compromised on quality. in the end, i stopped ordering online. 

now i order from a local kitchen only outlet where i have seen the kitchen, met the cooks. most of the time i do take out so i actually get the food prepared in front of my eyes. in the end, labels do not really matter. kitchens which only do take-outs or home delivery get a lot of flexibility as they do not have to spend resources on waiters and of course the dining area and such. this local guy decided to not have seating because it would have compromised rest of the operation. he is running indian, chinese and bakery from his establishment. tons of space for the cooks and baker. kitchen is accessible to you if you do take out and want a tour. friendly owners. 

it all depends upon the operator. you find a few good places. you stick with them. and you move out if they become shit. 

a restaurant does not guarantee a clean hygienic kitchen. unless it is an open kitchen which you can see from the dining area. eating out would always have the risk of food contamination. find a local small business catering to your requirement. ask them for a tour of the kitchen. and support them if they deliver on your expectations! I once ordered from a place called Midnight pizza and food, that shit was nasty as fuck. They are also huge contributors to your neighbourhood garbage dump Wholeheartedly agree.. I am never satisfied whenever I order in.. restaurants can get away with a lot of things.. things that would never be acceptable in a dine in situation.. I have received undercooked food, stale food, parathas with soil in them (literally!) and so on.. the irony is- whenever I order I want my food as soon as possible.. but my. Heart sinks after seeing the piping hot curries in flimsy plastic boxes.. some dishes are just not meant for ordering.. There’s no joy anymore in eating a special dish..  at least we had the consolation of ordering tried and tasted dishes from trusted restaurants.. this cloud thing will take away that one thing too.. there’s no accountability here.. reviews are losing their impact due to fake ones. I frequently order from a cloud kitchen, food tastes great, packaging is good. Never had any issues. I don't get food from anywhere where I can't see the food being made. Cloud kitchens are governed by the same rules that govern regular restaurants. They have to procure the same licenses, have to undergo the same kind of audits, etc. Besides, it's not just Swiggy or Zomato that have cloud kitchens. 

Cloud kitchens are a business by itself and there are a lot of third party businesses,including the likes of Future Group (that own Big Bazaar) that have their own cloud kitchens.

These kitchens are as clean (or as unclean) as any other restaurant. 

In any case, how many times do you check out the kitchen of a restaurant when you dine in? In all likelihood you could be eating at places with great ambience and a dead lizard in the kitchen. How can you be sure? so looks like a food with great taste can be sold on cloud kitchen. is it hard to make such food?",Food,2019-07-11 23:49:38

I am at a very depressing point in my life and my weight is the reason. I am 25, 6'0"" and weigh 145 KG's. That is around 300 pounds, which is the weight level people start making fun of in moves, to put it in perspective. I don't know what to do or how to reduce because any kind of diet I try, I'm unable to follow through. There are no fitness apps that are made for Indian foods and all, so I have tremendous difficulty tracking my calories. But most of all, I don't know what I'm doing.

Three years ago, I used to weigh around 110 KG's and at that point I thought it would be too difficult to reduce weight and didn't try because I felt it was futile trying to come back from that. Now, I'm going crazy thinking when I'll reach that point if I start now. I mean, if I make changes and work hard, it'll take me so much time to reach the weight which I already thought was too much to come back from.

>It’s a man-made crisis,” says Balram, advisor to the Supreme Court on right to food, in Ranchi. Until the 1960s, India had a sustainable agricultural system and natural food security, explains the act­ivist who worked closely with Jayaprakash Narayan’s movement in Bihar. People grew whatever they needed, or gathered from the surroundings—weeds, herbs, fruits, fish, livestock. The consumption of traditional coarse grains, pulses and millets, rich sources of vegetable protein with balanced amino acid profile, was exceptionally large.  
>  
>The green ­revolution changed the way people ate. A host of indigenous grains, seeds and millets disappeared.  
>  
>The landscape changed from the 1970s, in the wake of the green revolution. Focused entirely on wheat and rice, successive ­governments promoted quick adoption of technology, high-yielding grains, intensive farming, chemical fertilisers and price ­assurance. But pulses and millets, Indian diet staples and inexpensive sources of energy and protein, were ­neglected. A host of indigenous grains, seeds and millets disappeared, while production of pulses declined, as prices shot up. It led to a fundamental change in the way people ate, putting small farmers at the mercy of large ­commercial farmers, and dis­solving the idea of village community. “From around the mid-1990s, small farmer suicides and starvation deaths started getting ­reported,” Balram recalls.",Food,2019-08-22 04:00:06

I got home near my office. Gives me time to sleep more ( you can do something else).   

I don't cook on weekdays. I can but I don't, saves me the hassle of buying grocery, cleaning dishes, cooking food. I have cornflakes for breakfast, thali for lunch which has enough food to feed me twice a day, at night it's milkshake, lassi or sandwich. My food good expense is around 150-180 including take out, and other things like milk, bread, etc.  
  
Do a cost analysis of things, see what's cheaper option for you and what suits you the best.  
  
My monthly expense on food and travel to office is around 10k. I'll further reduce the cost by taking public transport.  
  
I can save 70-80% of my salary after paying rent.  
  
So it's a win win for me.  
  
If you don't like to cook, look for tiffin services in your local area.  
Instead of renting an entire house you could try shared accommodation and or pgs whatever suits you. Explore the every corner of city on your own . Don't rely on digital info. blindly. 

Save money


Make quality friends . Even some bakarchods are highly qualitative .


Do trekking , traveling ; but be frugal . 1. Buy your bakarwadi only from a chitale store.

2. Travelling by two wheeler is recommended because of unreliable public transport. I lived in Magarpatta City for 2.5 years, hands down it is the best area to live in Pune.

Look for room sharing options in Magarpatta (on sites like Olx or flats and flatmates on FB). IMO, you can easily find one for 5-6K. In Magarpatta, you can maintain a very high quality of life, if you live inside the township. There is a gym, jogging track, park, mall and plenty of eateries in Magarpatta. Plus your office will be at a walking distance from your home, so you will save plenty of time in commuting.

Have a cook, or cook yourself and eat at home, this way you will save money plus you will have healthy food.

Do you tip waiters here?,16,cf319y,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cf319y/do_you_tip_waiters_here/,20,If yes then how much?,jellybeans9198," Nope. We don't.

That is not our culture.

Those these days many owners include it in bill under 'Service Charge' and many people tip as it is a new trend in Indian society.

But mostly it is no. 10 or 20 depending the overall bill. And only if service charge is not imposed. I pay service charge. 80% of the time, there is service charge atleast added to the bill. So I don't tip extra.

Takeaways I don't tip. And most fast food prepaid places I don't tip.

I tip my waiter everyone we go to a local bars. The alcohol and food is cheap and the waiter are chilled out guys. Or in some places where I felt the waiter has actually done something extra. 

I am against automatic tipping. This has never been a culture while growing and I am not used to it. Already included in the bill as “service charge” or something. 10 Rs if the bill is more than 100Rs

Else it can go upto 40Rs depending on how classier it gets.

Also, if its high end pub, I have put in 50 to 100rs.

&#x200B;

Edit : All this, only if no service charge is included. No Most places include atleast 5% service charge, why is there is a need to tip again? Tip tip barsa paani... If you are at expensive place, read the check/bill and see if it mentions CGST and SGST. If it does then that's it, you don't need to pay anything. If they have added anything extra, ask them to get rid of it.

If you are at small restaurant serving coffee and snacks,  anything upto Rs.20 is fine. Depends. If they do a good job, then I tip them 40/50 bucks. 10 if it’s just satisfactory. No tip if they don’t care.

Tip valet guys if it’s a regular place I go to, like a coffee shop or a restaurant just because I want priority service. Give them 10/20 once in 2/3 visits. 

Our family has a regular restaurant we go to since the past 20 years, back then it was upscale, now it’s just normal. We get 10% discount here.

Non clickbait title: 8 lakh voters voted for NOTA in Bihar, the highest among all states. How do you know nota is in which no ? I voted nota here in pithoragarh how do i know which no was nota, ,,?

Really. The international chains you can try include Burger King, Mc Donald's, Pizza Hut but I think of this more in terms of unique items which are indianized veggie versions of international food - try these at any good restaurant which has it. 

Fast-food/American food/snacks:
Paneer tikka pizza,
Aaloo (potato) patty burger,
Paneer tikka steak,
Veg Pizza at a local snack shop (Desi pizza),
Roadside veg grilled sandwich,
Falooda (indian version of an ice cream sundae)

American chop Suey,

If you do decide to go there and must order veg, try the ""Paneer Makahani"" pizza.

Morons were discussing his stock market porfolio, his stock brokerage past and Rajdeep even went to say that ""Gujjus know dhando (business) and he will be good for the economy and will help revive small businesses.

They even published an article about it: [BJP chief strategist Amit Shah also a stock market genius, loves blue chips](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/bjp-chief-former-stock-broker-amit-shah-continues-penchant-for-investing-loves-blue-chips/story/352064.html)

FFS, these jokers were speaking from their arse. They think they got one exit poll right and hence people will start believing their bullshit. My thoughts:

Don't like thug/firebrand like Shah getting home, hope he  doesn't stoke the flame too much.

Also don't like that alternate medicine preacher retain the health ministry. 


Thought that Goyal would get finance but he could do good work for the railways. He did good work in the power sector.

Gadkari retaining transport is good. He maybe corrupt but he gets work done.

MP in neither LS nor RS. how ministry ? Missing rajyawardhan rathore as sports minister Jaishankar was a big surprise. Amit Shah has handled Home during Gujarat govt so this was kind of expected. Genuine Question: What is hype around Rajnath Singh? Why is he such a big leader? Can anyone highlight his previous 5 years as the home minister? What are his key contributions to the nation?

I don't have much trust in him as a DM. Why is there no mention of Suresh Prabhu? His omission is big. Having personally worked with his office, he is approachable, humble, hardworking and an intelligent man. 

The Shiv Sena angle is also good, politically speaking.

Food looks cheap as well in terms of 2500. But the restauranter is smart knowing Indians are full of idiots to fall for this scam. 2500, that's my monthly food budget. Anyways, you enjoyed it, great. You paid for experience. Great. For that price. Nope. Bhai ""super 30"" thali kab aa rahi Am I the only one tired of these stupid filmy thalis? 2500?? Barbeque Nation Zindabad! Nah. The other one looked much better. I don't think this is worth 2500, even if people can share it. Can someone explain to me why this thali is so much expensive than the one in Maharaja Bhog which cost only 500. 
Or is it the restaurant? Is this a fine dining thingy like Sanjeev Kapoor's? 2500 for this ? I would rather buy some expensive alcohol which i would never drink again . Very expensive. Man you can have same or even better thali at Sukanta, at a cost reduced by factor of 10. wtf Rs 2500? That looks worth Rs 500 at max. Even if it is 500 per person,  I can easily get a similar thali but just not extra sabji ( which you should ideally NOT require in a thali)  for around 180-200. North indian thali is known to be fulfilling and a good meal.  There is a reason why it is in every restaurant.  It attracts the working class. For pity’s sake, that Vegetarian thing costs Rs 2500?? Those sabjis on left side looks average.
Max I will pay is Rs.500 for this.

I could give a treat to 4 ppl at good restaurant with everyone eating to full belly. Even Barbecue Nation doesn’t cost this much. Seriously how the fuck is this worth 2500 ?? 500 max Overpriced af. Their menu on ZOMATO is such a cringe. Combos based on Kapil Sharma, Anjana Om Kashyap, Rekha, Yo Yo honey Singh...Narendra Modi?? etc. Wtf. Those papads look delicious af Sairat Jhala ji... ₹2500 nako re bappa!

*Translation :* Sairat happened, ₹2500 is a nope from me, dawg. Can't cough up so much for a vegetarian Indian meal. No fucking way! So, how many people usually eat this? Asking because my appetite is like a fifth of that at my best. Price is nuts. No point to consider ""taste"" Bakh BC itne me to Rajasthan wale 10 logo Ko khila de Rajdhani in Bangalore has a comparatively better and bigger than and priced around 700 bucks. 2500 is highway robbery for this kind of stuff Looks like a pile of very unappetizing and also veg food, and for 2500 rs that's a huge WTF from me.

You should have eaten the said Tiffin outside and then the box would have not been a problem.

Also, ""Intention"" does not take you that far in capitalist establishments. You see it as your tiffin, they see it as a 600 INR straight loss.

Water is allowed though. Did they store your tiffin for you till you got out? It's not illegal. It is a private property. So they can decide what you can bring to their premises. If the owner of the property lets you you can carry food. I don't think they can file a police complaint which will hold well, but they can definitely banish you from their property. Yes.

r/savedyouaclick Nothing is native to any place with everything has been originated someplace else. It's what they (the natives) make it out that's important. Indians developed those ingredients as their own and what came out was an utterly delicious extravaganza. There is simply no alternative to it in the World of food. Well it made Europeans to come here and take all of it. Yes Chilies came from South America to most of India, but I suspect they are also native to the North East and Indo-China - more research is needed - the idea that all capsicum came from the Americas is the generally accepted theory but indigenous varieties pop up all the time in the wild. Really nice article. Thanks for sharing it. I had my first ""Shradhaa"" last year due to my grandmother passing away. Eventhough it was a poignant occasion, the food was very memorable. Many of these dishes that are described in the article were made, and it was an interesting and flavourful experience. It would be pretty cool if the cuisine was made popular outside these occasions because I think they deserve it. It was initially hard for me to imagine food without the non-native ingredients, but the meal was really delicious. Had this conversation with my parents may years back, they refused to believe that potatoes or spices came to us from abroad.",Food,2019-06-10 23:26:17
How do you manage cooking Indian food each day at home?,10,butxk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/butxk2/how_do_you_manage_cooking_indian_food_each_day_at/,10,"So we have a little one who is 14 months old. We (my spouse 90% and me 10%) cook Indian food - predominantly south Indian - for each meal. The biggest problem we face is the amount of time spent on cooking and then cleaning all the dishes. 

I am not sure if this is because it is just the Indian cuisine that is hard to make? Any thoughts? how do you all manage?

We find it very difficult to manage our time as the cooking (& cleaning) and the baby sucks a lot of our time. 

Let me tell you my spouse is a stay-at-home mommy and still we feel we do not have enough time for other activities. 

Also - we have committed ourselves to trouble - like feeding the baby only home-cooked-meals and nothing from the Store etc.,

Are there easy, simple dishes that we could make? (Also healthy)",citizen_of_world," [deleted] I am no expert. But I have seen beginners struggling in managing time in cooking. With time you learn it, I have seen people cooking with ease while doing their other works. 

For best advice I think you should consult your parents. They won't ever charge you and give you to the point advice. I recently read a comment on this sub about OPOS (One Pot One Shot). I've started learning it as well and it has been life changing. 

I can cook Roti, 2 Sabjis, Dal, Chawal in like 30-45 mins. Gajar halwa in like 15 mins. 

I suggest you join OPOS school and OPOS Support Group on facebook and just insert OPOS ""recipe name"" on google to see the OPOS variation of the recipe. 

A couple of blogs I can reccommend 

[The Millet Table](https://www.millettable.com)

[Anyone Can Kock](https://anyonecankoch.wordpress.com) Relatives all have cooks or maids that help with prep. Cooking daily fresh Indian food is a full time job. I stay at home, OH works and we have a 2 year old. We don't have any help as we are outside India but we do share the house load (OH and I both cook dinner which I then have for lunch and I make veg parathas for the little one as he prefers rotis over rice and I get to sneak in veggies). Our fare is mostly South Indian and it is freshly made every day (except for the leftovers that I have for lunch). Our breakfast is always oatmeal as it's the easiest. Dinner is usually chicken with sometimes a veg curry/daal. OH also makes fish/pork curries for himself as well. The one thing that saves me a lot of time is the chapatis - I buy them instead of making them as they turn out hard on an induction hob (parathas are softer as they are mixed with mashed veggies). We also make biryani very regularly which doesn't take long at all. We have limited options to prepare as a lot of veggies/ingredients aren't available here but it works for us. We steer clear of time consuming dishes like dosa, poori etc (which needs chutney, bhaji, sambar) and these are made very rarely. Little ones are notorious for being picky eaters so I make sure we have at least few items he eats at all times like eggs, sausages, yogurt. The veg parathas are very easy to make as i just mix the mashed veggies with the flour and knead and roll out parathas immediately. We do not freeze or pre cut anything as it's not something I like to do but maybe that works for you. It's quite doable as long as you don't have expectations of cooking multiple items for each meal. Khichdi / Pongal - fill cooker with equal parts rice and (moong) dal, (some cut veggies), some jeera, pepper, chillies, (turmeric), salt, seasoning.  Steam.

It doesn't take more than 20 minutes to chop and mix. Another 20 to cook. I learnt about 5 Southern Indian dishes when I was there. In my case since I'm just cooking for myself it's easy, I'd say each dish can last me about 4-5 meals, and I usually have 2 prepared together. That means I only cook once every 3 days. Having larger vessels will help you here, though you're probably again limited by the size of your fridge - I live with 3 other people so only have access to 1/4 to 1/3 of my fridge/freezer.

I cook Moroccan, Italian, and some (adulterated) Chinese food but focusing on the southern Indian dishes the ones I do are:

\*orange/brown lentils with tomatoes, coriander

\*spiced potatoes with cauliflower and beans

\*palak paneer with ginger/garlic

\*semolina ""uppitu""

Can a skinny guy who is trying to gain weight and build muscle eat junk food (Indian)?,15,bm3n5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bm3n5v/can_a_skinny_guy_who_is_trying_to_gain_weight_and/,16,"I could have asked it on other subs like /r/Fitness but everyone will assume different types of junk foods so I'm asking here.

I'm 17 (M). I'm pretty skinny. A lot of people have told me to start working out. It also helps my mental health. But I was wondering if it would be ok to eat junk food while doing it.

And I don't mean KFC or McDonald's junk food. I mean simple Indian street foods. I don't eat them too often either. Like once or twice in two weeks.

Will it have a bad effect? 

Thanks :)",I_Watch_Turtle_Porn," Once or twice a week won’t break you, but long story short, junk food has junk macros and would be counter productive towards building muscle >gain weight

Yes

>and build muscle

Fuck no. The term you're looking for is ""Dirty Bulking"". It's a suggestion that don't it before you realise that it's too late and you're not able to control it and have that halwai physique with belly poking out and skinny hands and legs. A lot of people do it but that's the wrong way to do it. Junk food contains lots of cholesterol and salt, sugar, artificial sweeteners etc. Take simple carbs from natural foods like rice, potatoes, mangoes, corn, dairy products etc. Skinny guy trying to gain weight here. You can have them but don't make it a part of your diet (Like daily consumption). I've tried and tested a lot of stuff and now I'm sticking to healthy foods with some cheat days maybe once in 1 or 2 weeks. Healthy food (Make sure its a calorie surplus) with ample amount of protein is the way to go (1g per pound of body weight; but it seems a lot to me personally.) Junk food will most-likely abstain you from getting those sexy ass abs which are much easier to gain if you're skinny and are in your early 20's or lower. Good luck! Contrary to the popular idea, I think you should be fine with the junk food, even every day of the week. If you break them down, they are just a lot of carbs and fats so don't be afraid of them. The only bad effect could be from the type of oil that is being used (or re-used) or if stale/rotten ingredients are used. 

&#x200B;

Now this does not mean to be dependent on junk food. Try and stick close to as balanced diet as possible and always remember - the best diet (and the best exercise routine) is the one you can stick to for a long time. So if junk food brings you pleasure - don't cold turkey it, but act intelligently and adapt. heck no, only if you want to gain those belly fats. Eat low fat, moderate protein, (plant protein, stay away from animal ones), high carb, whole food plant based diet with high fiber intake, whole grains, leafy vegetables, beans, and stuffs, keep up the B-12, maybe Vit-D, and that's it. Start weight training. [deleted] E coli would like know your location Junk food has deleterious effects on one's brain too. Not recommended. In the beginning it helps in getting weight so no problem go ahead. After you gain about 5 kg start cutting out junk food. You're bulking up. Eat whatever the fuck you want. Just remember that gaining weight and gaining muscle are two different things. 

Don't worry too much about diet, technique, supplements blah blah blah. Just enjoy lifting and the knowledge will slowly trickle in. Once you get serious you'll forgo the junk food yourself",Food,2019-05-08 18:37:30
Bubble Milk Tea? Not for Indians,23,c9xutj,https://english.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=1755?utm_source=forum_reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=forum_reddit,26,,snowblue83," Bubble milk tea is cold. It is yummy but it contains tapioca which is sago. I imagine it’ll take some getting used to for Indians like me who like to dip a biscuit into a hot tea especially when the weather is nice. 

Indians just want a small cup of hot tea in most cases. Just a different palette. Many tea startups fail in India because they just don’t offer the low cost and simplified experience of a roadside chai stall.

Last but not the least, tea with a straw just seems non intuitive. I read it as Butter Milk Tea initially... was so terrified of the possibility of it.. [deleted] Problem with bringing any food to India, you make it too international standards and taste, you fail. I've never been to another country where authentic foreign food doesn't do well(withstanding middle eastern). If the concept is not from India then how can you expect it to be moulded like Indian tea? Ekh. Bubble Tea isn’t even that great. I’ve had it thrice now and there’s honestly nothing fancy about it at all. Overly sweet milk with tapioca pearls sunk in the bottom which taste sour always. It’s literally such an Instagram gimmick

Not my cup of tea Not sure about the Indian aspects but in the USA it is a huge hit among Indians, Americand and everyone in general. I love boba, I have it like thrice a week not sure where the hate is coming from in this thread Oh thanks for sharing this, i came across this bubble tea over YouTube, & thought that we didn't had any bubble tea sellers. I'm surprised to hear that we had them already, coming to the point of its failure, i doubt if any of the factors are major affecting the business. First and most important thing is there was no advertisement, how are ppl supposed to know about this product. For reference nobody knew Oreo here ,but with viral ads like ""twist karo dunk karo"" , it is quite well know all over india Yeah, not for us because we have a much better version of Boba Tea i.e. Falooda.",Food,2019-07-07 03:54:35
24M Canadian going to India from August to September. Any tips/recommendation?,14,ca8jhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ca8jhi/24m_canadian_going_to_india_from_august_to/,30,"Hey Indians of reddit. I'm going to India from August to September 15th. I wanna take a 200h yoga course and also visit ancient temples and possibly spend a week or so on the coast/beach to relax and enjoy myself.


I'm puzzled between going to Rishikesh, or Goa for my yoga training.? Any recommandations? I heard the weather is bad at that time of the year. Is it that bad? Anywhere else to recommend?

I'm also landing in Delhi and possibly staying there for a few days. What's there to do in Delhi? Is there a cool bar/ club scene? 

Should I use airbnb or hostels?  Tuk Tuk or uber? 


Also any tips or recommandations for a solo traveller would be appreciated",Marcools," Not sure about Rishikesh and/or Goa but I would recommend Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute, Pune for wholesome and holistic yoga lessons. Drink only bottled water. 

Zomato/TripAdvisor for food recommendations- don't try random street food stalls for the Indian experience.

Download offline maps for the states you expect to stay.


If you're looking at Yoga, Goa has retreats but is a party destination as well. Purple Valley is a good place. Goa is also close to Mysore which is another center for yoga in the world, particularly Ashtanga. Goa is also close to Hampi which is basically ruins of an ancient temple city - you'll find lots of fellow yoga enthusiasts there too!

I don't have much idea about the quality of yoga retreats and courses in Rishikesh but it will be much cooler and closer to nature. Being in the mountain helps. Also, finding non vegetarian food in Rishikesh is going to be very tough.

Tuk tuks (called auto rickshaws here) will try to fleece you. Insist on going by meter if there's no other choice.

Goa and Rishikesh both have good hostel scenes. Check out Zostel (a chain of hostels) or any decently rated hostel on booking.com should be fine.


Be prepared for people staring at you - some might even come up and ask for selfies. Uber For Travelling, stay in good hotels and Goa it is. If you are on a trip to devbhoomi, don't forget to visit the Queen of Hills, mussorie. Less hot and humid(Rishikesh is fairly hot even in monsoons).Being a Canadian, Mussorie should suit you better. dude, thats like 2/3rds of all Canadians, who will run things around here? August - September is a monsoon time in India. Late September there'll be less frequent rains.

For beaches, Goa definitely is the way to go. There are a lot of old temples in South India, however not many close to Goa. Closest that I can think of are Gokarna, Hampi (Hindu temple ruins), Ajanta and Ellora caves (no temples per se, but ancient caves with Hindu and Buddhist religious imagery). However each of these places will be around nearly 10 hrs journey by road or rail. 

Rishikesh will be a very different story. There are lots of fun stuff to do like rafting, but you need to check if it's open in rains. I doubt it. Weather will be a bit cold, cloudy and wet. There's a lot of places to visit nearby. Mussoorie and Dehradun are pretty close. Nainital is around 4-5 hours away. And it's all hills. Pretty good place to relax as well. >Goa or Rishikesh?

Rishikesh has more yoga camps and you’ll find more yoga enthusiasts there.

If it rains there(not sure about the forecasts) during that time all the water adventure sports will be closed.

There are yoga camps in Goa but it’s more for partying and enjoying beaches rather than Yoga.

&#x200B;

>I'm also landing in Delhi and possibly staying there for a few days. What's there to do in Delhi? Is there a cool bar/ club scene?

You can find a lot of nightclubs in Delhi, you can go to connaught place or hauz khas.

&#x200B;

>Should I use airbnb or hostels? Tuk Tuk or uber?

You can try both. In hostels you can find other bagpackers. In goa i'll recommend [Jungle hostel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/in/jungle-hostel.en-gb.html?aid=356980;label=gog235jc-1DCAsobEINanVuZ2xlLWhvc3RlbEgzWANobIgBAZgBCbgBB8gBDNgBA-gBAYgCAagCA7gC_5GJ6QXAAgE;sid=f2fb745eaa535deb61b0ff36a90fb8f9;dist=0&keep_landing=1&sb_price_type=total&type=total&). Prefer uber or ola instead of tuk tuk so that you don't have to do unnecessary bargains. In places where there is no cab availability you can use tuk tuk or you can rent a scooter to roam around . If you go to goa then you should rent a scooter to roam around(make sure you don't drink and drive).

&#x200B;

>Also any tips or recommendations for a solo traveller would be appreciated

Make sure you have a power bank for charging your phone when you're out. Get a sim card from Airport. For a college project I interviewed few foreigners who came here to visit. The problem they all faced was selfie. Different is exciting and you're different than us so people surely wanna take a selfie with you. Handle it properly, with smile and show your discomfort when so many ask you. Tuk tuk is very fine but you also get uber auto option on uber app itself which is very cheap and you don't have to bargain. Clubs are good, enjoyable but they are same as Canada, you aren't gonna find any difference there. Apart from one guy everyone of them were having good experience with hostels and they were enjoying it too because of fellow bagpackers. Now, I'm too lazy to type more. Lol [deleted] [deleted] Interested in wildlife? Just FYI, I don’t think I’ve ever heard them being called tuk tuks in India, it’s usually auto rickshaw, or just auto for short. It will be raining cats and dogs in Goa

I have about 9 cats I feed, 2 kittens. For the kittens plz keep the food to soft till they are about 6 monts.

You get Meow packets, various flavours. But make sure the packets says 'kitten'.

For the adult cats you can get a 2 or 4 kg dry food packet and feed when possible.

I use Minimo and Pure pet. They are decent and not very expensive. >But I am confused which cat food to buy because there are few different kind of cat food on amazon and flipkart and I dont know which one do they like/prefer.

Any of them would be fine. Meow is the best. They have dry as well as wet. Like give them dry food and once in a while give them wet food.

ALso please do a favor neuter them. Contact your nearest animal related ngo and neuter them.

A single kitten as early as 6 months can produce upto 80 cats in a years. But most of them die due to accidents, fights starvation. Purepet is cheap too, if you can find it. All of my cats have had good health. Cats are generally carnivores. I would recommend some meat or egg instead of cat food, i have read that the quality of pet food is not good. Milk. Cats do like it. Do not feed them. They are hunters, you will make them lose their hunting instincts.

Haven't flown Air India in a while. Has this always been a thing - not serving meat on domestic flights? Such a weird thing to do.,104,boeep3,https://i.redd.it/rtdo8g1nz3y21.png,145,,jeep_effort," Yes, they announced a while back something like this for 'cost cutting'

i am unable to find the news source so i can be wrong. It’s been like this [since 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/world/asia/india-vegetarian-airline-food-uproar.html) and was touted as a cost-saving measure but of course the so-called majoritarian aspect of it is hard to miss (‘so-called’ because many states are [significantly *not* majority-vegetarian](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-diet-indian-palate-non-vegetarian-vegetarianism-3099363/)). 

Ironically the article quotes a tweet about the national anthem before flights ... while that never happened, Air India staff are now required to [say *Jai Hind* “with much fervour”](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/air-india-jai-hind-flight-announcement-1470303-2019-03-04) as part of their preflight announcements. 

India’s politicians’ capacity for tokenism never ceases to amaze me. Imagine you would have to keep 2 different meal types aka 110 veg and 110 non veg, would cause wastage and logistics issues, so just keep 180 Veg meals, also their food is fucking awesome Not always. This is one of the many moronic diktats of this government. Less choice means they need to carry less variety on board. Otherwise, they _have_ to carry a lot more because you dont know ahead of time how many vegetarians/ non-vegetarians on board, and it leads to food wastage too. 

Do you really care that you don't get a little meat in that one flight? Just land at your destination and get yourself the chicken you are craving. Completely normal thing to do, other airlines cut cost by serving not serving meals, these guys do it by serving 1 type of food only I flew air India recently and had an amazing vegan meal. It was better than the vegetarian one as they seemed to put more effort into it, so if you can choose I’d suggest trying it


Edit: why the downvotes guys, if you are unhappy with having a veg meal I was just suggesting a nicer alternative to plain veg Politically motivated or whatever but i commend actions like these.

  


Don't start with saying ""freedom of...."" so and so. We aren't predatory animals by nature. Humans have the option and luxury of eating vegetables and food, so don't kill just because we like the taste. Even the predatory animals don't kill for fun.

  


Sadly I'm a non-vegetarian myself but I'm cutting my meat consumption every day. I think this was one of their cost cutting measures. Are we becoming Americans now? Complaining for each and everything. I think if you fly their widebodies domestically you get non veg meals. One of the only airlines to serve free hot meals in India. Other than Vistara maybe. Weird yes but I still like them the most of all airlines. Good vegetarian food too btw. Best food imo amongst all airlines. JET/Vistara food is pretty crap. $ Saving measure. Interesting discussion. Did not realise it would kick up a minor storm.

The measure does seem legit for cost cutting. I remember Delta's story of saving millions by reducing one olive in each meal. What inspired it is of less interest to me. It is government owned so its their call and biases can always creep in.

I would, however, say that this is a bit like missing the woods for the trees. Given the situation the airline is in, the logical thing to do is cut down on non-productive functions while retaining or improving customer delight functions. That's what Singapore Airlines did in their turn around. I guess the realities of politics, unions and the trade-off between immediate job retention vs long term job creation forces everyone to make suboptimal decisions.

More than anything I found it funny to state that upfront. But seeing the discussion here, clearly the right thing to do 🤣

Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,51,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,24,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends.",JaJH," You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. 

Quite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.

Having said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.

The real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. 

Eating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.

Regarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.

  


I also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad!",Food,2019-04-18 22:43:12

sorry  for bad English. # I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK   /s Back in college days, I recall a roommate of mine taking in a puppy out of passionate affection he felt for it. In doing so, he removed it from the street it was familiar with. Six months later, he realized he hadn't the time to afford constant care for the pet, and he took it far away from the place we were in - about 10 kms away to some woods and dumped him there. He was regretful of his actions, but it doesn't alter the fact that he changed the course of life of another sentient being. 

If you don't have the time to commit yourself to the care and affection pets require from an owner, better to leave them to their own environment, and let nature train them. If you do have the time, good on you! Take only if you are going to care as if it is your own child. Else don't bother. Don’t. Their mother is probably nearby or out hunting for food. Don’t deny the little babies their mom just because you think they’re cute.  Sure. But be sure to check with your astrologer first. 'Yin and yang puppies' is a much better description than the '69ing interracial puppies' I would have gone with I guess.  Take them, take them all... you should take them. Our native breeds are very low maintenance and less demanding. I have only adopted native breeds, and one of them lived a long 17 years before succumbing to old age. My second dog is almost 6 years old and still not have any serious issues other than some problems related to discipline. Meanwhile, who else noticed the ‘Chutki’ wrapper?

Note: there are no spaces between the word Chutki. So did you take them home or decision pending?  Take only if you can take good care of both of them, provide proper food,shelter and medicines, take them out for walks, be ready to spend a really good amount of money for their vet checkups and buying them food, toys to keep them happy. Dogs can get depressed if they don't get enough attention. 

So if you are going to adopt them please never ignore them, a dog needs 24/7 attention I know a bunch of people who adopt dogs and just get tired of it because dogs are hyper and always needs to play or because the vet exams are expensive.  I got a pet dog at home recently. 
My mom and dad like to play with it, feed it and care for it.
In doing so.. they have forgotten about pestering me for marriage.
Mission Accomplished xD Breaks my heart's seeing them like that. Sure, take them in. But be sure to neuter them, microchip than and train them. I saw somewhere that you are vegan? Don't give the dogs human food. Especially during the puppy stages as they need a whole lot of protein. Stick to pedigree (Wet food is better). Also, remember, dogs are social animals and belong indoors. Give them my love.  If you're going to adopt and care well for them, you'll have an enviable sibling couple of black and white.  More pictures please We need regular updates op Please take them and constrain yourself to adopt them but only if you can , 
If you take them do get them vaccinated and get a vet card ( which will have the name of dog and the vaccination dates with stamps ) , be sure to get them megavac 6 type vaccine so that they stay healthy and immune to common dog diseases 
 Take them , if you can handle the responsibility ,or take them to a shelter or some place safe .. Yes yes yes, they need you, you need them 😊 No its spring season their momma left to get some fod for them, take them only if their momma doesn't come back in a few hours. #YES. T A K E Watch out for the morbid mom... Would you name them ying and yang? As long as their mother doesn’t mind you doing so Man how dirty our country is so often, with construction and tobacco mess everywhere and often a defeated broom as well. Sad, just hope it really is for the ""better tomorrow"" the posters always claim they're for. 
 India has a serious problem of stray dogs everywhere and yup it also contributes to garbage and dirt and liter all over the landscape  Please take them in and give them a better life Take them to a vet first and then take them with you given that you can take care of them if you cannot then sell them to someone  reliable. By the way they're cute Not joking but check if they are not bitten anywhere, I have heard rabies cases spreading this way. You should but please take full care of them and support them whenever needed. Dogs will only love you but you have to give them equal love back. Does all of India look like a construction site? Just kidding 😆 Yes.  Please spay/neuter them and give them their shots at the vet. Yes There are shelters who care for them, if you can adopt then that will be best else give them to any good care center so that they have a better life and are looked after :) Not indian but OF COURSE
 Very sweet!!!!!!!!!

There's something really suspicious about how it's made.. can't drink or smell it. masal pao Nutella. 

Itne paise me kitna sara sugar aur palm oil aa jayega. Doesn't even taste good after knowing the truth.

Same for Cornetto. Its just extremely sweetened, hydrogenated vegetable fats. Basically flavoured dalda. They don't even call it an icecream, its 'frozen dessert'. Ginger/cardamom tea. I hate both of those spices. And life was absolute hell when I visited Delhi for a month during winters, where neither coffee nor plain tea was available avial  Poha 

## can't stand the sight of it. Upma/Sweet Potato Sohan papdi Mushrooms:  Too squishy , also soggy,gooey when cooked. Green tea. 

All my friends love it, but I seriously can't stand it. It doesn't have a great taste, doesn't refresh me like a regular tea. Momos...fuck that shit. Milkshakes

Lactose intolerance ftw Bangan Rajma Chawal.

(If you disagree, upvote) Raddish Kheer. Hilsa fish. Apparently a Bengali delicacy. Never liked it. Still don't. I wonder if I'll ever be disowned as a Bengali. Biryani or pulao with whole spices like black pepper, cloves and stuff. Use fucking powders Naan.



just putting it out there, yahan koi agar biryani mention karta hai uske saath mera katti. Veg biryani.

Coz it's not real.  Chicken and meat

I do eat them for their protein content(especially when I am lifting at gym) but it's feels very ruberry to me and find it quite difficult to chew.I just prefer something soft in my comfort food. Kachori  Mushroom  Any Fish dish. Smells so pungent. Ironic that I am Bong. Fuck dhokla tbh BeganBharta / Jalebi / upma/ Dal makhani [removed] Anything ghee.

The thought itself makes me puke. Poha, Dhokla, Idli Dhokla  Baingan! Anything with it and I’ll vomit.  Curd  Bread gulab jamun, jalebi, kheer, halwa.. Finally! Everyone seems to always have a half onion with lunch or dinner and I just never got the appeal. choor-choor naan. Looks like vomit but tastes great. Desi Ghee. Whenever I eat it, my stomach becomes upset. some kind of allergic for me. Tried homemade ghee and readymade also. When I smell it, I feel like vomiting. I hate rotis. Dry shiz. Rice for the win. 

Also HATE RABDI.  Rice I find the looks of Kerala beef fry highly unappetizing. For consumption it's either donuts or seaweed salad.  Desi Chinese 

Sweets like Jalebi, Rasgulla  Biryani Same as you OP. Can't stand raw onions.  momos. all varieties. Shrikhand  I'm surprised no one else has said paneer yet. I can't stand paneer. What's worse is that most people treat it like it's nuggets of gold or something. I just barely tolerate cheese.. having cooked cottage cheese in curry is just a big no for me.  dal baati - BC stone age food. Momos Plain curd. The taste perplexes my mind.  curd rice Hyderabadi Biryani.

Just take awesome Awadhi / Bengali biryani, and add a buttload of mirch masala, and you get Hyderabadi Biryani. No aroma of rice. No flavours of meat. Bas mirch masala khao. At the risk of offending a majority of the population, I'd say butter chicken.

I just hate it. There is nothing good about it imo. I've given it many chances in India and abroad. I've even had many ""authentic"" butter chicken and I still can't even seem to like it, love is a very far off emotion. Jackfruit. I can't stand the smell of it.  Hey, Check the video i have made.

"Hunger in Chennai (Madras), India, 1876",2401,b3el73,https://i.redd.it/mazqqxqi3bn21.jpg,292,,Abhi3626," Holy shit. I think the biggest achievement of independent India is that we've never had famines of this scale since 1947, food sufficiency has been achieved. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1876–1878

According to this article , the famine killed around 5 million and Viceroy Lytton still exported crops . This is exactly like bengal famine during WWII . But since we are already overpopulated , these death tolls don't matter on the world stage.  Colonization = genocide. So horrific how the murderers are held up as heros. British tevdiyas 

Just hate how they destroyed us  That is horrifying  One of many topics which they do not teach in schools. [deleted] This hits so hard. I feel like I'm gonna see this in my head everytime I'm about to leave a little food on my plate. Can't wait for Brexit. Loving independent Ireland already. [removed] To teach Indian freedom fighters a lesson (uprising of 1875) British ruthlessly burnt fields. Later the bengal Famine was also created by British, who deliberately banned grains to get indigo cultivation for the clothing industry. 
But hey - they were the benevolent colonizers who ‘gave us’ railways, civil services, vision of modern India shared by Jinnah and Nehru. 
Fuck Brits!! Believe it or not but the water crisis is going to hit us hard the same way as the photo shows starvation. During the same time, Lord Lytton organised the luxurious Delhi Darbar of 1877 for the Queen to proclaim her as the ""Empress of India"".

 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Durbar#Durbar_of_1877


(From Wiki) The durbar would later be seen as controversial because it directed funds away from the Great Famine of 1876–78.


While the country was going through one of the worst famines in the history, and these mother fuckers were celebrating in Delhi.
 [removed] Sad and tragic photo

Famines have also been an intriguing part of recent history in India. Unfortunately, they do not attract much attention, no doubt  due to the public discourse here which has made people ignore the horrors of British imperialism, while focussing their energies entirely on the Mughal rule.

[Millions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36339524) of Indians died in famines.

 Over [4 million](https://yourstory.com/2017/08/british-raj-famines) died as recently as 1943! 

There were more than 31 famines in 120 years during the British rule, compared to about 17 in the [previous 2000 years](https://yourstory.com/2017/08/british-raj-famines)!

Famines were a regular feature of life in India in the [19th century](http://www.environmentandsociety.org/exhibitions/famines-india/timeline/famines-india-timeline), to which the British rulers turned a convenient [blind eye](https://www.thoughtco.com/famine-in-india-nineteenth-century-195148).

There is so little documentation of the lives of these people by the English-speaking Indian elite of the time and the British masters, that it is tough to know the true stories of the sufferers.

For systematically bleeding India, for the deaths of millions of Indians and for ruining the economy - the effects of which India is still recovering from - the British owe not just an apology, they owe [full reparations](https://youtu.be/2bkQmgNru5I).

But in the same vein, we must also remember that even after Independence, tribal regions of [Orissa, Jharkhand and Bihar](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/death-by-starvation-31046) have continued to suffer famines on a larger scale; while chronic malnutrition, hunger and starvation deaths plague all regions of the country, irrespective of state or party in power.
 [Kalahandi](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/special-report/story/19850731-orissa-drought-famine-force-women-in-kalahandi-to-abandon-and-sell-their-children-770267-2013-12-27) district of Orissa had remained synonymous with hunger and poverty for decades after Independence.

Deaths due to starvation [continue to occur](https://www.ucanews.com/news/starvation-deaths-haunt-india-despite-economic-growth/82968), even in [New Delhi](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/starvation-deaths-in-delhi-india-is-great-but-we-indians-are-definitely-not).

On the first day of 2019, a [woman died](https://thewire.in/rights/jharkhand-starvation-deaths-government-welfare-schemes) of starvation in India!

[Hunger continues](https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/death-by-hunger-is-india-s-tragic-reality/story-5lNVR6Q2LXXjEsQrnIeGdL.html)  to be the stark reality for millions of Indians.

However, because of the huge stigma attached to starvation deaths, these data are [forged by local authorities](https://sabrangindia.in/article/death-hunger-activists-protest-government-inaction-over-starvation-deaths) to make them appear as deaths due infectious diseases.

India seems to be sharply divided along political ideologies, yet no political party can claim to have eliminated starvation and malnutrition. 

Even in the recent few years, [upto 56 deaths](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/2-brothers-starve-to-death-in-up-revealing-a-torn-social-security-net-118102300187_1.html) have been reported due to hunger.

The [fight against hunger](http://www.bhookh.com/hunger_facts.php) and [starvation](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/starvation-index-larger-than-that-of-hunger-in-india-development-communication-n/310797) must continue in India, inspite  of the mainstream media being obsessed with bullet trains and fighter jets. 


'The government can't get away with large scale famine, but it can get away with chronic hunger. It has become an accepted part of life in India.' Jean Dreze, economist.

 Churchill was a scumbag

*change my mind* Naanka famine of 1866 in odisha lasted for two years and caused one million deaths which was a third of the population. There is evidence of revenue officers underestimating the need for food grains. 

A story goes that revenue officials saw women wearing bronze Bangles and thought that it was gold, therefore they underestimated how poor the people were and food prices were kept high.

I don't know how true the story actually is, it was told by my grandma. Saddest pic I've seen...

It goes to show how far we have come since Independence Can't see this....... It's so sad......tears rolled out within 10 secs........       Man! And people say older times were better. Isn't this the Bengal famine? what are the chance at least one of them survived the famine? Never forget what the British did to us.  Fuck the British  \*churchill laughs in the corner Such things happen when when you consider some group of people as subhumans. The British colonists didn't think that Indians were human beings too. Such assholes even exist today as one of their descends massacred Muslims in Christchurch. There are many such people in India too who would be happy to do such horrible crime against some other group of human beings. Holocaust - plain and simple. /r/London or /r/BritishSuccess should see such things. Yup. British rule definitely was better wasn't it. Simon come back!!

Amirite Fuck brits.. fuck those assholes.. fuck.. fuck.. fuck them... Thanx Britain  Chennai guy here, sad reality is you can still find some people in Chennai who are still starving to this extent even now  [deleted] This is disturbing to watch was this during a great famine or something Pretty sad to even look at it. We can't even imagine how did they survive.   There has never been any answer from the British for the actions of Lord Lytton, and many like him. And we will never know the pain of an India where 55 lakh human beings starved to death. u/Abhi3626 could you provide the source for this photo. Am interested in seeing more work by this photographer. Damn! I feel sad seeing the pic only! TIL.. my goodness, this looks terrible. We should value the resources that we have, farmers does so much hard work to get the food to our tables. Britishers seem to have exploited us too any extent they could. Till the time man is there he will oppress his weaker  neighbour or get oppressed by a stronger one. 

This is the TRUTH. Unless we evolve into something greater. 

How do we do that. 
Take a FULL PAGE PRINTOUT of that image. Paste it onto your walls. Be it phone pc fb WhatsApp bathroom or your bedroom. 
Everytime you look at it think how you'll honor their memory. 
Not by blaming the whities or the brown collaborators or marwari profiteers. Or by discussing shitposting assigning blame on Reddit. 
You can only do so by ignoring all the above mentioned actions and devote a certain part of your time and other tangible or intangible resources to  see to it that not another human (not Indian) shall die for the simple lack of nutritious food. 

And no sirs and madams of the internet world, you don't have a right to assign blame or demand apologies unless and until we make ourselves free of blame. 
So stop whining and get to work helping instead of masturbating on Reddit like me. 

Oh btw Brits have gone long back but we still are having cases of starvation deaths. Not only in the north East chai bagans but sometimes in heart of the city like calcutta too. Recently heard of a case where the doctor reduced to penury died of starvation along with his aged sister and both didn't have any successors or any savings left. Now don't go about blaming modi Nehru ghandy or momuta. 

The stone hearted society is at fault. Those imbeciles are just a representation of who we are. These politicians represent us and not some foreign or extremely rural concept. They represent the society and it's mentality. Till we ourselves won't change they won't and mor will the so-called outrages against humanity.  This picture should be published in british textbooks. Fuck Winston Churchill. Probably healthier than India is today lol  I saw the post in /r/pics and the title was ""A man guards his family from cannibals during the Madras famine"". Brought tears to my eyes.  This used to be the norm.

**Haber Bosch process** changed it. Fertilizers increased food production and increased carrying-capacity.

We will return to this norm as extraction of Natural Gas, which is a crucial ingredient in Haber-Bosch process, dwindles. Thanks Churchill.

People routinely do this in Starbucks. Helps when you have a common name. Orders tend to get mixed this way as the restaurants call out the delivery guys name. I booked Uber in Jaipur. Back then there was the option to call the driver directly instead of following the call through a call centre. I called him and True Caller showed his name as ""Shaktimaan"". If I were a swiggy guy, I'd probably do the same thing..
Instead of Bright Future, I'd name myself ' 15 lakh '.

"Going to India, specifically Ahmedabad, for the 1st time to attend a wedding. What can I do around there if I have two weeks?",34,c82hr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c82hr0/going_to_india_specifically_ahmedabad_for_the_1st/,25,"My initial thought is to fly in to Ahmedabad and flyout to Mumbai. Hopefully that would be enough time to explore both places including the 3 day wedding (crazy!).

&#x200B;

FYI I'll be there around end of Dec to early January 2020.",TheGoldenHorde," You will need a liquor permit to purchase and drink alcohol legally in Ahmedabad. I think your passport should be good enough for the permit. Food:

1. Jay Bhavani Vadapav 
2. Food trucks opposite Karnavati club for dinner. Also Manek Chowk.
3. Early morning poha at vastrapur lake or parimal garden (all vendors taste pretty much same)
4. Early morning muska bun chai at VS hospital
5. Late night chai/coffee at Nescafe on the road running parallel to riverfront on Dufnala side
6. Late night trip to Ashok Pan Parlor for a quick smoke. The shop is AC btw!
7. Sev Khamani for breakfast
8. Fafda Jalebi at Iscon 
9. Khetlapa chai in kulhad
10. Gordhan Thaal for Gujarati thali (Fuck Patang, its overrated)
11. Checkout everything on the menu at Swati snacks on C.G.road (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
12. Coffee with local art at Zen cafe opposite L.D. College of engineering.
13. Ambika daal vada with fried mirchi.

Places to visit:

1. Day trip to Dholaveera
2. Relief road. This is the old city, checkout pols (old houses) here. Its a UNESCO world heritage site! While you are there enjoy some veg puff at Pinki pizza.
3. Hatheesinh ni vadi
4. Adalaj ni vav
5. Akshardham 
6. Kankaria Lake
7. Thol lake (HIGHLY RECOMMEND)
8. Sabarmati riverfront in morning and night
9. Sabarmati Ashram

&#x200B;

Please take some pictures and share after you are done with the trip. You will enjoy the city more if you have access to a two wheeler. Hope you enjoy your stay! And of course, let me know if you need any other help.

&#x200B;

Where are you coming from btw? Food Recommendations in AHmedabad:

* Farki near Delhi Darwaja for shrikhand and lassi
* Rajvadu at Vejlapur (go in the evening around post 7. THey don't accept reservations) for some traditional dance and also get royal servings of thali
* Patang Hotel near ashram road - revolving hotel with ok food, but more for the view of the city
* Manek chowk for the late night food stalls

&#x200B;

Tourism in and around ahmedabad:

* Kankaria zoo followed by eating local street food at the kankaria lake
* Swamirayan temple along with their guided tour
* Vintage car museum
* ethnic and street wear shopping in the evening at law garden. Haggling is encouraged
* adalaj step well
* gujarat science city
* lothal if you're an archaeology buff
* evening walks around the river front
* gandhi ashram
* There are many water parks in and around ahmedabad 
* nal sarovar lake for bird watching

&#x200B;

Tourism places in gujarat but not in ahmedabad:

* Gir lion santuary
* Dwarka temple, somnath temple
* Katchh desert I issued it from the metropole hotel. Near sabarmati  bridge. Go to Go, skip Mumbai. Mumbai will be very bad in rainy season. Ahmedabad has a sprawling textile industry.

You'll get premier quality for dirt cheap. 

And then there's Sabarmati Riverfront 
The street food. If you plan to get drinks, use your passport. Only drink in the confines of a house, not public.


I would suggest going to other areas around Ahmedabad. 

Check out statue of unity, if you get time. You can visit Sabarmati Riverfront, Gandhi Ashram, Mahatma Mandir, Gift city in Gandhinagar, Manek Chowk (Midnight Food Market), Try Gujarati Thali @ Gordhan Thal & Vishala or dine at Revolving Patang Hotel (360° view of Ahmedabad), Buy some Khakra from Induben or Falguniben.

It doesn't even mention the name of the paper. 

Like one doctor says in the article, basing conclusions only on food is wrong. Other factors should be considered. For example, what if the genetic trait responsible for lactose intolerance is also more prone to diabetes? The study has found that eating calorie-rich food like sugar and honey increases the risk of diabetes while addition of protein-rich food and dairy products in a meal can help reduce the risk of diabetes.  

 The study also found that eating protein-rich food such as pulses and nuts decreased chances of diabetes. Similarly, states where people ate more dairy products had low prevalence of diabetes 

Its more common in states like West Bengal and Kerala where people consume more non-vegetarian food than the States where diet is predominantly vegetarian.

Also, diabetes was found to be more common in males than females.  The prevalence of disease was found to be more in districts which are close to coastal areas Cries in vegan",Food,2019-07-17 11:46:41

What are some unique and simple things which future generations might not know of but would be enviromental friendly?

Today most of us cry over use of plastic bags, environment change or such but actually we going deeper into being more environmental unfriendly than before. 

For example : As a kid, I used to go with my grand parents with a lunch box or a can to get break fast or lunch from a local hotel. A decade later, my dad used to bring food in newspaper packets placed on banana leaves wrapped by a thread and cans for liquids. Then it was plastic packets and now it is plastic boxes.

Similarly beverages. We used to drink aerated fluids in those lovely glass goli soda bottles but now the plastic mini or big bottles. 

What other daily life objects went more environmentally unfriendly?

Ps : I feel so nostalgic thinking of those goli soda bottles and how awesome and simple they are.

I actually think that we might see a return to this, with plastic becoming an increasingly unsustainable option. There's shop in my my hometown which still sells Bants for Rs 5. Whenever we used to go to my cousin's house, his mother used to ask him to bring banta for us :D
It has been a long time since I have had it. Lattu I still remember those banana leaf and paper wrapped food packages from restaurants.

For comparison, I ordered in through Swiggy yesterday and I have a bunch of plastic containers and packets I have to throw away now. 

Recyclable or not, ordering Swiggy or Zomato is really a downer for me recently because of the massive amounts of plastic containers the food comes in and I feel very guilty. Hmmm.

I'll take those odds. Agreed. Just finished a diarrhea bout. The day was too hot, had a sugar cane juice. Liked it and had at 5 different places in over a week. Sort of asked for it.

Then please start issuing certificates to the stalls where it is safe to drink the juice! Like it's gonna stop anyone here. The surprising news is that nearly 20% is actually safe for consumption.

Daya kuch toh gadbad hai? I always ensure that I drink juices from the remaining 19% stalls Well... Doesn't change my mind Another Day in India. People still buy these stuff? 

Yuck... There is an important difference. With roadside juices, the worst that can happen is diarrhea the next day. However with bottled drinks like pepsi and coke, the effects are long term like obesity, diabetics. Roadside juices are definitely healthy but may not be hygienic. Bottled ones are hygienic but not healthy. IMHO you try once and  if it doesn't affect you, keep drinking.

For people with longer hair strands, losing them may be more noticeable.

It all depends on how prevalant this is. If this is just some group o friends and occours rarely. It's not a big deal. But if there are so many students who increase the visitors percentage by significant number . It is actually bad for wedding organizers.
 If there was ever a question of the influence of Bollywood in our country.  Then provide better food in the hostel mess! Gate Crashing banned  This is on my bucket list. Went with a friend to someones marriage from his church, who even he didn't know, but I don't that would count. 

ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ Don't blame the college. Blame the media for their incredible headlines.

""NIT Kurukshetra techie steals food from peaceful wedding"" Students who enter any wedding/party without an invitation should be considered freeloaders, it's okay if they're only a few but not when they come as a horde, could mess the whole budget.  I remember a story from a friend.
Friend's friends had a hostel near marriage hall.
initially they gatecrashed weddings well dressed.
after getting habitual and lazy they didnt care about their dress.
Imagine attending wedddings in pajamas. u/DudeWheresThePorn One of my acquaintance in NIT Jalandhar does the same with his friends. He says not only the food but also the thrill and experience is worth it.  It is really interesting/funny/hilarious/amusing to see people making the best use of their thesaurus.   Well, what if they wanted to do a science experiment to test out a new battery? 3 idiots dekh ke pahuch gaye! 🤣 Occasionally even hostel wardens do something we can agree with.  How are they supposed to sustain themselves? Mess food?  If they catch you, tell em that you saw it in a movie. Cringey text. Does the Chief Warden also speak like this? r/nottheonion I was cool with the gatecrashers wanting food at my wedding, I wasn't cool with the gatecrashers wanting selfies with me.

There's no space between type and of  Lol! My school. #Proud People in this thread try to understand that this is wrong. Don’t justify it by saying they’re young, fun loving or short in money. Rich or not, nobody likes an uninvited guest. Good that no one made a Chowkidaar comment this time around.  That's preposterous and dictatorial. Its right of every student to gatecrash wedding who suffers from deadly mess food everyday. My friend is from NIT Kurukshetra, She said that college rents out campus ground for weddings on holidays and students gate crash it to have free food. Lol how do they know for certain that NIT Kurukshetra students gatecrash weddings?! Proof dikhao bsdk Haha, this is the most weird notification I have come across.  oh those quora conquests by the storyteller, i will miss you ! Lol time to pack me bags Reminds me of 3 Idiots.

And my college days... Gate crashing is a ritual in MCC!  You guys dont get invitation on behalf of science? /S Taking inspiration from *Band baaja baarat*  I see When u take movies like 3 idiots seriously... It was prevalent when I was in college (before 3 idiots came out). But it was a small group of people who used to do this frequently. And they used to create a ruckus when caught. Nobody wanted a scene in the function and they would get out scot-free.   There is no way any institute in India can enforce any such rule. Unless they have campus accommodation and need to provide invitation to a party as proof to leave the campus. 
 Anything short of that is meaningless wastage of paper.
If  any gatecrashers are caught, then the organizers may call the police, [criminal trespass](http://www.legalservicesindia.com/article/449/Trespass.html) under sec. 441 of the I.P.C. is an offence that can attract imprisonment upto 3 months. Lol we used to do this every weekend during wedding season in November and December. Best days man. Is that guy a programmer? LoL he's written typeof with no space. 😂😂😂 Aah...I wouldn't expect anything less from one of the top institutes of India. You boys make me proud  when the hostel food is way too bad As a Chauhan my signature is very similar lol Ham science ki taraf se hai.  ""Desist away""
*Laughs in poor English* Wo Science ki tarf se hai 😂 I don't blame the students. The food in the NIT hostel mess must be bad.  I have seen this happening.  Somehow people find it cool.   Modern problems require modern solutions.  I have done this so many times. It should not be banned.  Actually, in smaller towns and villages, people will be have happy to have guests. Primarily because they don't pay for food on a per plate basis like in cities. They just cook targetting a certain number of people, which includes a buffer to be on the safer side. Do you think 3 idiots is kind of responsible for this? What students do in their private life is their choice. The college shouldn’t have any say in what happens off campus grounds as long as all on campus rules are followed.   Funny thing is, they crased the Warden's daughter wedding. lol...guys take snapshot n ask what font is use in fonts.com And what all does the ""Institute rules"" include? #Thank you 3 idiots, very cool! 3 idiots live action. We were a small group of 4 students, who used to crash weddings. The biggest problem was keeping it a secret from everybody else in the hostel, as we did not want others to join in, and get us caught.

Needless to say, this post brought back a lot of memories. No one will be there to represent science in those weddings? what a shame!  If only the hostel food was edible. *3 Idiots music intensifies* What's better nit kurukshetra or Pec?  Kummanadi is illegal!  Apun to phir bhi jaenga Now this is literally Moral Police. ""in the city""

Why is it your fucking business? Not saying the students are right but this smells of totalitarian big brother type hegemony. Chaliye gate crashing ko vanakkam Maybe it is time for the NIT kurukshetra management to provide good food in the first place  What are their options with the quality of food they get in hostel? Not a big deal during our college days from KU my many batch mates ,seniors and classmates always keep the coat and pant ready to gatecrash marriage usually the venue chosen was always big fat wedding specially in big palaces ,banquet hall etc and people really do not bother boys having food even some times they know the regular offenders but things turn messy when ppl drink and dance and also get involved in eve teasing and brawl. 

&#x200B; Moral policing by govt college is not a good sign.
 Inspired by 3idiots BC fir acha khana aur achi daroo kahan se milegi This notice is like modi's speech 

If it would have been like press conference like ward asking students why they crash at  weddings, is it bad food or something.  I've doin it for past 9-10 years. This is not cool. First PUBG and now this. We need to fight for our rights. Im self proclaimed inspector who needs to build up karma in comment section in order to post.

Amazed to see such an honest shop at airport. Check the food/beverage rates.,237,at0cs2,https://i.redd.it/c8ioiniljvh21.jpg,56,,blurtingman," Yeah but the taste is horrible. I too was excited about the rates but the cup of tea was quite bad. So shops are allowed to sell at normal rates. I was under the impression that they are somehow obligated to charge exorbitant prices. Location? patna. I was surprised too. Although the airport is in bad state. too much crowd in tiny space. people have to stand as sitting space is less compared to people. Tangential to the point that is trying to be made, but there's nothing honest about selling a product at a low price. It's not inherently dishonest to sell at a high price. What would be dishonest would be to charge prices that are different from that on the  menu or not provide a receipt. why this airport looks worse than railway station ? Amazed to not be able to see anything. Noticed this in Coimbatore Airport too. Low cost counter of sorts which sold food at decent prices.  At Mumbai International airport, there is this shop called Cutting Chai and the cutting chai is like 90 Rupees. That's not honest. That's just cheap. Just because a shop is expensive, doesn't mean it's dishonest.  Which airport is this ?  Ah, Patna airport^(is terrible)
 Where does the staircase lead to? Hidden marketing agenda!! Shop name checkout. Which airport ColdDrinks on MRP is nice... Rarely get to see that anywhere even in malls, theatres  I think the reason food is so costly at airport because of all the tax/rent they have to pay to have a shop there.

If it is cheap, it won't be good. Fortunately the rates are not in $ (US).  [deleted] 20 rupees for tea is considered cheap now?",Food,2019-02-21 15:31:01

I hate it when people waste food,15,bktdsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bktdsl/i_hate_it_when_people_waste_food/,12,"Moved out to another city for work last year for the first time, since then I have been to many outings for food. And the thing that connects most of these outings is the the sacred practice of leaving food behind for holy dustbins. 

I truly detest these people (well it usually lasts 5 -10 minutes). I used to tell people around me to finish their food, but people usually do not care. Because by most their understanding they paid for it so it's their right to decide the foods fate. I stopped ""bugging"" them as this was ""annoying"".

When I think, why I get so annoyed by people  who waste food, I think it's because of my mom. She always used to tell me to not  waste a single grain and how much hard work and time is put into growing that single grain ( when I visit my village for minuscule amount of time and do insignificant amount of labor work, so I can sort of understand  ), so I obliged (although my sibling still leave food sometimes)  and it sometimes leads to overeating.

Now when I see people leave food, the above mentioned points do not come into my mind, its just infuriates me. Hope I will get used to it or the people will change.

Hope you don't leave food on you plate, or do you?",harinan," Oh boy! You must visit a wedding to see what real wastage of food is. People stuff their plates with free stuff, have one spoon each and dump the rest so as to not look ""greedy"".  

As a person who regularly does the dishes, another breed of people I hate are those who think the sink is a garbage dump and the leftovers will magically disappear. No, assholes, they don't. In my place of work, if I complete the food in my plate; people make fun of me saying that there is no use of cleaning my plate. I can instead give it to someone who enters the cafeteria at that time. 
>not  waste a single grain and how much hard work and time is put into growing that single grain ( when I visit my village for minuscule amount of time and do insignificant amount of labor work, so I can sort of understand  )

Here is a thought that may help you come to terms with it.
People who do all that hard work to grow that single grain don't do so for altruistic reasons and to put food on your table. They grow it so they can exchange that grain for money.

Now, wastage or not, they are getting their money. In fact, I think the wastage would make more sales, would it not? My mom has indoctrinated similar principles in me. I never waste food because I know there are several people in our country who don't have the privilege of eating meals. I try hard not to waste food. Try because sometimes specially in social functions people serve way too much and I can't finish. But that's rare because I tell them upfront that I can't eat this much and I don't like to waste food. I even try to cook in limited quantity so as to not have leftovers. For outings, we always pack up the extra leftovers and bring home. There should be no shame in doing that. ( Best is to carry your own dabba to pack leftovers). 

Saving food, water, resources is a good thing. Though becoming angry doesn't serve any purpose. Tell your friends once in a positive matter of fact way, ""yaar khana waste nahi hona chahiye."" Moral policing will be a put off. So don't do that. Sometimes the food tastes horrible. Sometimes they put/give more quantity than I can eat. In these cases, I'll definitely leave food on my plate. ""Ek ek dane ko tarso ge ek din"" Father always lauds Op, instead of bugging people to finish their food, why don’t you instead ask to take as much they need in another plate. And then if there are leftovers they can take it home or give it to someone in need. 

Otherwise the food that’s dumped in a person is far more harmful than being dumped in the dustbin. I do waste food sometimes. If the quantity given to me at a restaurant is too much, I will eat as much as I need and leave the rest. I'm not gonna overeat after I'm full. My body is not a garbage bin where I just dump food. It'll just make me fat.

Again, this is only in cases where I can't control the quantity served to me.",Food,2019-05-05 11:35:45

There were bones all over two tables, the seats, and the floors. I mean what the fuck. After about 15 min, the sight made me nauseous. Mini Punjab, linking road.

They do not use fresh vegetables & meat and I've had stomach upsets on my last 2 visits. There was a gap of more than a year between both the visits and in my experience just shows how they have done nothing to improve their sub standard ingredients. There's this Snow Lion Thai restaurant in Matthikere, Bengaluru. I went there last week and ordered some pan fried noodles. As I was waiting bfor my noodles, a cockroach ran across the fucking table. I felt absolutely sick, but I stayed due to sunk cost. The food came and I started eating it, it was decent. Halfway through, the fucking cockroach decides to run across my table again. I felt like puking, got up, paid the bill and left. Felt horrible for the rest of the night. 🤮 Veena Store, MTR near Lalbagh and Vidyarthi Bhavan in Bangalore.

If you put food in there, just write on the packaging the date by which it should be consumed. Who is responsible if someone put bad food?

Delivery man never delivered my food and UberEats is ignoring it.,68,b55z3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b55z3w/delivery_man_never_delivered_my_food_and_ubereats/,27,"Happened yesterday. I had called for lunch like I've always done. It usually takes half an hour and I pick up from the vehicle itself. Once the delivery man arrives,  he gives a call and I usually collect the food. 

Yesterday,  the guy doesn't call. Given the terrible state of the app in Bengaluru, updates on the order do not show in my notifications tab. A minute after the delivery time,  I check that my order has been delivered. I cannot contact the driver cos only their name is displayed once the delivery is done and customer support seems to not even give a damn. An automated message is all that I received. No refund and not even a half assed apology. 

Given the general lack of professionalism in people hired by Uber (taxi drivers refusing to switch on the ac, constantly asking for a 5 star rating) it comes as no surprise. Anything else that I can do to take the issue further? Uber doesn't seem to have a customer helpline number and all complaints are usually through their app. ",minty27," I'm surprised that you kept taking services from a company that you term unprofessional. Why would you do that?  Honestly, I personally don't feel like these services are worth the hassle they can be sometimes. I know a lot of these are isolated incidents but it's always easier to do things by myself, even if it's a little more work because I can trust myself to do it right rather than get annoyed if these guys mess up. 

I understand it isn't feasible for everyone for different reasons but that's just how I see it. 

You could try their social media pages to try and get a response from them but I wouldn't expect too much. Hopefully it'll work though. 

 Delivery guy for UberEATS calls me and say that the order (Ice Cream scoops from Frozen Bottle) will melt by the time he reaches my home (~10 mins away). I tell him that I regularly order from there using swiggy and have never faced an issue and ask him (nicely) that they deliver it, even if it is melted. 

The guy hangs up, my order switches to 'Picked-Up' and then, within a minute, it shows 'delivered'. Multiple calls to the number go unanswered. Uber support also couldn't help me. After talking with them for 30 mins, I finally got to someone who could process a refund for the amount deducted from my wallet. 

Observations:

1. I could have waled to the store in the meantime and picked the ice-cream up personally
1. The delivery guy probably had the ice-cream himself
1. I lost the 50%-Off coupon I got through CRED
1. I'd rather walk than order using uberEATS again There is a customer service number. 
Go to help section in your order and follow the messages.  Happened to me too but good thing it was a cod and i let go of it never used it again UBER is the worst when it comes to customer service.

It takes forever to find customer care no.

On top of that you have to wait for like 20 mins on hold.

Then they say that they cannot do anything. Had a similar experi nice with uber eats, deleted the app soon after. I use all the food delivery apps regularly except UberEats ( They charged me thrice for one food order over the course of 3 days. They refused to acknowledge the mistake and brushed me away even after providing them photo proofs of my paytm deductions.) Uber's customer care absolutely sucks balls. I have faced this frequently in foodpanda. I usually order just from Swiggy but after OLA acquisition, I decided to give foodpanda another try because of the offers.

&#x200B;

I ordered 3 times from them and 2 times they cancelled the order after 1 hour of placing it. 3rd time the guy picked up the order but didn't deliver it(but it said delivered). So 100% of the times, I did not get the food I ordered. I did not follow up, if I got a refund or not for 3rd time but I suspect I didn't get refund because according to foodpanda, they delivered it. NCH INGRAM uber eats is shit

i personally only use Zomato and Swiggy Uber Eats won't even accept my card as a payment method. App says it's already added but doesn't display it as an option and they have no UPI so I just stopped ordering from there. Their loss, I guess. I had a bad experience with UberEats a few days ago . I dropped a review on their Facebook post and they replied instantly . I had to bicker with them for an hour but I got my refund. THey reply. Just wait or tag them on twitter.

1) Less picky with food. Most vegetables used to trigger my gag reflex. Not the case anymore. This has probably something to do with eating in moderation/deficit than weight itself. 

2) How my body handles temperatures. This one's double edged sword. I used to handle cold like a champ when I was 90 kgs but hot weather used to be a nightmare. Now I can handle heat a lot better but absolutely can't endure cold. I would say it's a good trade off. Unbearable cold lasts like two weeks at best. 

3) Don't feel light headed when I suddenly stand up or sit from resting position.

4) No more random ass joint pains

5) I don't sweat a lot anymore. Helped with oily skin too. Clothes and undergarments stay fresh for longer time. There are lot of upsides to not sweating from every single fold and crack the moment you move a muscle.

6) Easier to naturally breathe with nose. When I was 90 kgs I would occasionally mouth breathe. 

7) No more acidity problems. That is obvious given that I don't eat like a pig now. Even my so called ""cheat days"" consist of less food than my regular meals from 90 kgs days.

8) I can get by without eating junk food every single day. I used to always buy packet of lays chips, soda, pani puri etc etc. I still eat junk food but I naturally made a switch to quality from quantity. 

9) Quality over quantity - This change happened naturally, not something I actively pursued. When it comes to food, quantity for the said price was always important. My priority used to be cheap and decent enough so I literally fill my belly. 

Take samosas for example, I like them very much and had them almost three to four time a week. So I didn't care for quality as long as they were edible enough (Rs 20 for two). Now I try to find best Samosa I can. My current favourites are Rs 90 per plate from nearby hotel that makes them from scratch every time you order. I don't live in tier 1 city so Rs 90 is lot for Samosas. They taste very fresh and there is lot more to masala instead of just aloo. Now I eat Samosas like once or twice a month instead of every other day yet I like them even better.

You see what I am trying to say?? Before quantity was very important to me. Now whenever I eat junk food I make sure it's worth it. I do this with everything not just Samosa. Whatever I eat, I make sure food's worth its caloriess.

10) Reduced carbon footprint and pollution. I walk a lot more now instead of taking a vehicle every time I step out of house. Reduced plastic waste a lot too. I used to buy Lays chips or random haldiram product every single day, that's a lot of plastic from one person. 

That's all just top of my head. Of course there is lot more stuff like looks and whatever.

BTW I used a simple CICO (calories in, calories out) method to lose weight. No special diet like paleo or keto. I tried keto and paleo but they were very hard to stick to.

Just simple CICO and counting calories worked for me because it asked me to do just one thing - Stick to my calorie budget. My calorie budget is 1600 calories per day. Ate just regular Indian foods. When you limit your calories intake, you will naturally gravitate towards healthier options. All your energy goes towards a single task of staying under calorie budget. That makes it a lot easier to stay on track.",Poo_C," Don't forget chaffing, and walking with little more pace That's some good work! Congrats on the progress I've gone down from 108 to 89 and I've experienced the opposite of the first point. If I'm gonna spend my calories, it's gonna be on vegetables that I like and are beneficial to my health. When I was 108 I would literally stuff everything in my face. I have gotten a lot more picky at 89. Kind of off topic : I breath through mouth naturally. I have to manually breath through nose. Any tips to naturally breath through nose?. Any habits to try? My nose is in kind of a weird shape if looked closely. Thanks
Edit: Aight guys. Going to visit a doctor. Thanks y’all. For everyone planning on losing weight, I recommend intermittent fasting. It works if one sticks to it for a reasonable period of time. 

It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle. 16:8 is the easiest to follow but you can take it farther for faster results. 

r/intermittentfasting for details. How long it took you to lose weight Same here for a 6"" person. Used to weigh upto 95 kilos a year back. Now have consistently brought it down to 79 kilos. 2, 3 & 5 is happening with me too. Initially stopped eating evening snacks and food made of refined flour. Last few months have been doing push-ups, pull-ups, etc and the muscles have toned a bit. Still long way to go to get ripped as it only becomes touger ahead. All these tall people on this thread losing 10-12 kg surprises me. I used to weigh something between 75 to 80 kg before enrolling in a weightlifting programme and putting on muscle mass. My current weight is 95 kg, but I still fit into the same pants. I need bigger shirts though.

I weigh far more, but I eat more or less the same. Quality of life has improved by miles.

Stop focussing on weight. Muscle and bone is denser than fat. Work on getting stronger, not thinner. I was at 104 kgs and i was depressed. I Didn't join any gym or any yoga class. Learned about managing my diet from Youtube and used apps like MyFitnessPal and Homeworkout. It's been a year and now I'm at 63 Kgs. 

Pros:
1. People respect me now and everywhere i go they just look at me and say ""Tum itne patle kese hogai"".

2. I can finally wear a t shirt.

3. I am motived to do anything now.

4. I feel smarter. 

5. I am happier.

Cons:

1. Loose skin 

2. Stretch marks

3. My old clothes which are too big for me

4. Shoe size, from 10 to 7.

5. Muscle loss.

Overall, it changed my life. My first war that i had to fight alone and i won. I have few questions :

1. How did you keep a calorie count? I mean from Indian context - Roti, sabzi etc how do you calculate calorie?

2. Did you follow any exercise routine? or you just started exercise after you reached 74 kgs? What routine do you follow? Dont forget to mention head turns from women. Congrats Man!!

6 ft guy here, with weight fluctuating between 106-113kgs since few years..BMI 32+ smh. 


Every point you wrote felt like I was writing it. Spot on!

I tried CICO but I loose my will power in between and go back to old ways easily.

Mainly evening snacks...I can't tell you the absolute craving my soul has to eat something spicy or cheesy in evening. How to stop that??? How to curb your cravings???

My goal weight is 80kg... 


Again, congratulations what you did is awesome. I do still feel light headed when I suddenly stand up and also have fainted many of times. When I was overweight this wasn't an issue. What do you think i'm doing wrong over here ? 102 kg -> 78 kg reporting in (6 ft 1).  Had to buy a whole new wardrobe. 10) lulli looks bigger after you lose weight. 💪 Well done buddy! I  wish you the very best for the future! 😊 Congratulations. As somebody who's also lost a lot of weight some years ago I'd say that points 3 and 4 are not related to your weight loss and may come back depending on other factors. Other than that thanks for reminding me what I also used to go through when I was overweight. Food is no longer an important factor in my life now, it's something I have to do for survival so I simply try to eat what is healthy or easily available and never eat snacks etc but only two full meals a day, morning and afternoon. Went from 104 to 67kg. The best effect it had was on my mental health. I'm now more confident and less anxious than ever before. But I can't eat outside coz in the past people used to judge me so I still need to work on that Hey, may be I missed it but how much time it took loosing all 15kgs? Dude most of your problems apply to me too,i am skinny,hoping to gain weight.I hope to have them resolved by gaining weight and healthy food habits too. Heavy breathing intensifies > 4) No more random ass joint pains

What the fuck are *ass joints*? Thanks.  A very helpful post. 👍 Congratulations Very very congrats!! I know how hard weight loss is. And I salute you for this. You have shown tremendous dedication and achieved a wonderful thing

Btw guide everyone about what exercise you did. This is awesome OP! Congrats to the new you! How long did it take? Amazing and motivating. All the best mate. I lost 10kgs myself and I have better mental health than ever, I walk with confidence and have an actual social life. It's great. Congrats! Lost about 25kgs (17M , 6') from 100 to 75. One of the most important changes was my mentality, I used to be a, what you could call, ""A Negative Person"", after losing weight, I feel positive about everything because losing weight is hard and comes under those long-term plans for which we get/need advice and tips, which kinda give a vibe that we can't do it, especially when you've been overweight your entire conscious life.

&#x200B;

When I accomplished this ""long-term goal"", I felt I could do other things as well, things which seemed impossible before, now seemed a lot easier, I improved my grades, killed off my bad habits because I just felt I could ""anything"" because of my new positive mentality.

Also, you didn't mention pain endurance. It is easier for me to endure pain after losing weight. 3 years ago I went from 97 to 81 kgs. The feeling when you sleep well and feel rested in morning is amazing. CICO is the most effective way to lose weight. 
It will surprise you how little you actually need to eat to lose weight. 
You don't even need to exercise much if you change your eating habits. 

You can exercise later after you've achieved your weight goals. This is because, if you exercise and reduce your food intake at the same time, it's hard to continue because you get more hungry due to the exercise. If you're 91kgs you're 91kgs! OP has the best username ever Congrats bro..you should be proud. I too lost a lot of weight. And have noticed all the changes that you mentioned.Except, I still get light headed when I stand up at times and my  body aches like shit all the time. Plus, I thought my limbs wont get numb if I lose weight. But, I still get numb legs or arms when I sit or sleep in an awkward position for a prolonged period of time. One thing that I absolutely love is that when  I go out, I can eat anything as much I want without being afraid of getting diabetes. It feels so great,you know. The constant worry because your uncle is  diabetic and if you keep eating like shit, you will develop diabetes too. Gone. Getting fit is more  of  a lifestyle change. It changes the very core of your being. I would never get fat again. Ever.

&#x200B;

And my advice to other is that it isn't as hard as it looks. Just start counting calories and you see improvements in a month. You absolutely dont need to go to the gym even once if you wanna lose weight. But, exercise is healthy, though.

&#x200B;

To OP, keep on losing bro.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Another negative. My natural cushoning is gone. So, I cant sit for long on hard surfaces. It hurts like hell if I sit on the floor. Maybe I will get used to it as time progresses.

&#x200B;

It's nice to see that losing weight has helped people mentally. I am still the same. Someday, maybe. I have been trying to lose weight too (6', 92kg).  
Intermittent fasting is okay for me in terms of time slot (10 am to 6 pm) but I haven't been able to reduce my calorie intake.  
My concern is that I tend to lose focus while working when I don't have enough filling food during lunch. What do you recommend that I try out as a snack that doesn't add much in terms of calories, but can keep me feeling full? i sweat more when after I lose weight Lost 23 kgs. From 110kgs to 87 kgs. (I am only 5""8'). Was obese my entire life. Was born overweight. Still have to get in 70-80 kgs range. The best thing happened to me was that I discovered Olympic weightlifting routines. That has transformed my body so much. My body was always flexible. So to people trying to loose weight, don't try to become a bodybuilder. First try to move max weight possible as much. Olympic weightlifting routines require explosive strength, which is much more beneficial. People get in awe when I clean and jerk 90-100 kgs. And the last Calories In vs Calories out as the OP said. And try to replace water with food. We think we are hungry, but it's just our thirst for water. Also the main thing is people treat you differently - for me I noticed that people approach me a lot now.

  


Also public transit in a place like Mumbai becomes less cumbersome! Weight loss is not that important, tell us your body fat percentage. Thats a better indicator of health",Food,2019-04-19 12:21:43
"Enjoying great Indian food (dosa and Thali) in Indian bar, in Tel Aviv, Israel. My favorite food, the best food, I feel happy now :)",481,ac97pf,https://i.redd.it/rehw4a1pf9821.jpg,122,,Bloomberg1512," An Indian place doesn't look legit until food is served in stainless steel plate. Beer with dosa lol. That’s like beer with pancakes or omelettes.  Wow .. the dosa looks authentic ..  Dosa with Spoon!  
Wondering how OP actually ate it 🤔 That looks legit. Cheers! Glad you’re enjoying it :) hope you had a great time!  What all did you have? I think I am going to try this combination today- Dosa and Beer. There might be something here. How was the taste? Good to know you like Dosa. Now pass couple of Sabich this way! I'm mind blown. There are indian restaurants like literally everywhere! 

&#x200B; It's looking delicious. Seems like a very good place. 👍 Shalom  Damn - now I want dosa! : / Dosa and idli is my all time fav. breakfast. Idk if OP will see this but I know there are some Indian Jewish People in Israel. Do you know any personally? How do they like identify as Indian-Israelis  But the face says a different story :D Enjoy that lovely city! Was this taken at the Tandoori restaurant in Herzliya? Masala dosa is my favorite too. I never knew, you could eat dosa with beer :/ Harry Potter and Ron Weasley don't look too happy with what they're having.  Crispy dosa and coconut chutney Dosa with Beer.

Now why did I not think about this before? Why you making him eat it. His face clearly says "" why you doing this to me?"" 😂😇 This reminds me of a tamil movie, where the hero mixes idli and beer in the opening scene [deleted] [deleted] Indian food is great mate but Dosa isn't the greatest Indian food. :p Wouldn't it have been something new and nicer if you tried the food of Israel, rather than going all the way to Tel Aviv to eat Dosa? It’s one of my pet peeves. Indians go on vacation around the world and want to eat Indian Food everywhere they go. 

And then the first thing that they talk about is the quality of the food.

God, visiting new places is not about taking selfies around the world.

Edit: Just realised OP was Israeli.

i do some exercise 50 push ups (2reps) and 50 crunches(2reps) since last week ive been trying to do pull ups about 3 i can do.",Kshatriya71," There's no need to get into supplementation. Eat good food and workout. You will develop muscle size with time regardless of taking supplemental sources of protein.
Rome wasn't built in a day. Give it time. 


 Through normal food, target 1-1.3g of protein per Kg body weight per day. 
Cut out fried food and excess sugar. 
Depending on dietary preferences and availability, regular cow's milk / paneer / yogurt , soya and it's derivatives , pulses and legumes, and eggs are the best sources of protein for vegetarians. I'd also look into quinoa and Raggi as alternates to rice and wheat flour. 

Source: Am a nutritionist. Soya chunks. Whey A lot of really poor advice on this thread. Here's what I'd suggest. 

First, find a good workout program. Not just your arms but your whole body. Otherwise you'll end up with good arms and chicken legs. Body weight workouts are okay but nothing can beat a good compound workout. Squats, deadlifts, bench, military presses. The second best alternative is dumbbells.

Focus on strength and mass and hypertrophy will come with good diet. I'd strongly recommend something like [Strong Lifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) or [All Pros Beginner Routine](https://allpro-sbr.fandom.com/wiki/AllPro_Simple_Beginners_Routine_Wiki).

You should really focus on being consistent and not half-assing it. And you need to be dedicated. A good workout program is only effective if you can get through it, regularly. I'd say pick something and sick to it 3x/week. I'd also add some cardio 1-2x a week for your cardiovascular health and endurance.

Two, focus on your diet. Let's say you're 5'7 and 55 kg. That puts you at ~1800 calories a day. For you to gain weight, let's say you need an additional 500 calories a day. That's ~2300 calories per day. 

In terms of macros, let's say you do 50% carbs, 30% protein, and 20% fat. That puts you at ~290g carbs, ~170g protein, and ~50g fat. 

I'd suggest eating a bit less on non-workout days, but keeping the same ratio. That would be 225g carbs, 135g protein, and 40g fat. The simple math is that a gram of carbs and protein have 4 calories and a gram of fat has 9 calories.

What does this mean in terms of actual diet? Well, a cup of rice is 45g of carbs (that's an actual measuring cup). A chappati is 15g of carbs. 

A large egg has 6.3g of protein. A glass of milk has 8g of protein. Unfortunately, milk and eggs also have fat and carbs so realistically, unless you're really eating nothing but eggs and milk, there's no way you're getting all your protein from these two sources.

So your alternative is either eating meat, or getting something like whey. A scoop of whey typically has 20-24g of protein and around 120 calories. So, you can eat around 2-3 scoops 2-3 times a day and then supplement it with regular food. I'd also suggest getting vitamin b complex supplement (since vegetarians tend to have a deficiency) and fish oil. 

Ideally, a combination of some eggs and milk for breakfast, some whey and veggies for lunch, and a regular dinner with more eggs and more whey would be ideal. Nothing beats real food when it comes to nutrition.

Following a good regimen for a few months will go a long way towards making a difference. I'm not advocating tracking every calorie, but I think it's generally helpful to understand your diet and where the shortcomings are. Typically, Indian diets, particularly vegetarian diets, tend to be very high in carbs and fat but dismally low in protein.

Personally, I do a combination of things. I lift, run, and climb. Previously, I used to swim a lot (almost everyday). In terms of diet, I eat a lot of veggies and salads, fake meat, and drink protein shakes. I do eat meat, but I limit it to good cuts (e.g., a good steak vs. a burger). Indian food is my indulgence but I limit eating a lot of carbs to maybe 1-2x a week.

[I'm sure you'd like to know who you're getting advice from, so I'll leave this here as proof that it works for me. ](https://i.imgur.com/NadNPxj.jpg) Curd and eggs are good, unless you are pure veg, but yes whey makes it much easier. Take care of your diet, have 5-6 meals a day and lift heavy weights. Please don't just buy whey protein thinking that it will give you strong arms. Its called a ""supplement"" and it won't work unless you get to work! (lift weights)  
Fix your diet first, eat clean sources of carbs, get an adequate amount of protein(1g per kg of body weight to start with and then later you can increase it to 1.5) and fats too.  
Veg protein sources: milk, paneer, yogurt, soya, lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans, peanut butter, almonds.  
Get a gym membership and get on a training plan. You can check the fitness subreddit wiki for recommended training programs.  
After you make lifting weights a habit for 2-3 months, maybe then you can increase your protein intake with a supplement. Pull ups are the way to go. Also check out r/bodyweightfitness Correct me if i'm wrong but a lot of body builders in India are vegetarian - so being a vegetarian should not really get in the way of getting a fit body (i'm talking 'fit', not muscular). There are plenty of vegetarian foods that can provide your daily requirements effectively. No excuse for lack of protein on a veg diet.

Eat - Nut/Seed butters, Paneer, Cheese, Daal and Soy.

If you eat eggs even better. You've got to earn your supplements. Work out hard you'll see gains. Once you plateau it's about the right time to starting taking whey. My advice start exercising and at the same time make minor changes in your diet, like trying to eat more paneer, eating an extra katori of daal etc. Don't straight away jump to major changes irrespective of how motivated you feel right now because that's just not going to be sustainable. As for being a vegetarian, you can have a great body despite being a vegetarian, case in point - John Abraham. There's a youtube channel named Fit tuber where an indian guy uploads videos on diet and bodybuilding. He has uploaded videos for budget diet plan and vegetarian diet as well. You can try checking it out. Read r/gainit wiki Eat more times per day. I easily gained 13 kg by having 5-6 times meals per day. You can easily consume when you gets the hunger for it. Soya, grams (chana), peas and peanuts are good sources of protein. Maybe also take vitamin supplement for the vitamin B12.

&#x200B;

Note that protein is overrated for bodybuilding and taking it excessively puts load on your kidneys and liver [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-protein\_diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-protein_diet)

&#x200B;

Also doing same exercise everyday will not help you gain muscles. You have to allow it to heal back (gain). Do crunch (12×4) once every three days, Arms/upper body the next day and legs on the third. Hello friendo, are you pure vegetarian or are you ok with eggs? I’d recommend adding eggs to your diet, but if you can’t have them thats fine too. You can get protein from pulses, kidney beans, paneer, broccoli, soya beans, green beans etc.

You have plenty of options, you may also consider protein supplements but please note supplements are no magic pill, it will be a long grind to build muscle but if you stick to your routine you will see progress eventually. I recommend joining a gym, a good trainer will not only help you develop a good workout routine but also help you with your diet plan. You need to lift weights. Or if you don't want to, you need to do proper bodyweight exercises. Peanut butter, cheap and best vegan source of protein. You can have it with whole-wheat bread, chapati, or just by itself after a workout. Hope you aren't allergic. Eat almonds throughout the day. 100g (about 90-100 almonds) has 21g of protein and about 600 calories.",Food,2019-06-13 20:08:17
What are some things that Indians who live abroad often say that is demeaning/ stupid?,66,bl8vdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bl8vdv/what_are_some_things_that_indians_who_live_abroad/,123,Need this for a comedy sketch I'm making. Please let me know in the comments.,omrikon1," Buzzfeed should stop mooching off reddit! ;) Refering to African and Oriental people as Kallu or Chapte. It's degrading and shameful, especially coming from a group that's near the bottom of every measureable human development index. ""Indians living in India have no creativity. Just ask others for ideas to use in their own comedy sketch"" I've found that Indians who move to the US for education or job or w/e, are super racist towards black people, so they talk about them in Hindi, saying things like ""kaale log X karte hai and waise hote hai"".

I've also noticed how for Indians, Americans=white. For instance, some Indian guy here at my college is with a black girl, so everyone says ""Arre woh toh black ladki ko date kar raha hai"". Some other guy is apparently with a white girl and people say that he's dating an American. 

All of this makes me super angry. Vegetarian Indian colleague:   
>How do you eat that, that's disgusting     
    
(looking at a Chinese colleague while eating Malatang).  
    
Indian Director to a Japanese Agency guy:    
>Indian music is the best music.    
    
These are just few of my cringe worthy experiences. A wonderful not friend of mine.. Why do all Indians message the firangs for nudes and shit!!

&#x200B;

The bobs and vagene shit.. No not every one in India does that stupid shit.. 

And you just left this country 2 weeks ago! Dry heaving when faced with foreign food. People outside India eat beef and pork, and because of the large number of other immigrants you we get say, authentic Chinese food which won't be like the Indian ""Chinese"" they are used to it. *Get over it*

It's ok if it is not to your preference but if there aren't any Indian restaurants around you just gotta eat. I've legit known people who'd rather go hungry for hours than eat another culture's food.

Also, funny enough I've had more conversations about caste from British Indians than I've had with Indians in India. No I don't know my caste nor do I care cause I wasn't brought up that way. Sorry. Complaining about Lack of spices (especially chillies/heat)  on food that was never meant to be spicy. Eg: certain authentic Chinese and Italian dishes. Bonus point if done in the middle of dinner/restaurant that someone took you to . ( My MIL dies this constantly - makes ne irrationally angry )

Classifying all westerns girls as ""easy"" /lose/randi and getting even more toxic when rejected for being creep.

Declaring cultural superiority (internally of course ) and being tone deaf to local customs . One of my friends started whining  to me about how Americans are rude because a random lady scolded him -. Why ? She held a door open for him , and shezade shaib walked through without thank you or not even acknowledging her. This same guy also orders subordinates and secretaries around without any please excuse me or thank you.also talks in Hindi /Urdu even when English speaking are part of the group. Thankfully after getting scolded by more than one person and official complaint to his boss he has started to improve . ""Since 2014, world has begun to respect us. Even when I go for my morning walk these days, people see I'm Indian and they look at me with respect.""

While they get a permanent citizenship abroad and don't even come to India to exercise their vote I remember going to India and asking what my cousin meant by ""turning the geezer on"" lol hahaha. The typical reaction of young Indian/Indian origin people born and brought up abroad when they come to know we have most western brands and something they might not have.   


""Wait, you have (Insert brand here) there too?"" I bear a name which makes it hard to guess which part of India I am from. I have heard both North and South Indians insist to me that Americans (read white people) like them more and consider the other very odd. Never met an American who could distinguish a North Indian from a South Indian though. Boarding a flight wearing a suit and a tie.

Bringing back tshirts and stuff purchased from thrift stores and acting like it's a very expensive material. Racism. Have spent my whole life in different parts of the US except for 4 years of engineering. I'm back here now.

Everywhere, the Indian diaspora is racist towards blacks. Not everyone of course, such a broad generalization would be unfair. But there are many who don't consider them ""Americans"" per se. Ironical. Indians who get citizenship , PR etc of a country they migrated to suddenly become racist towards others, specially desis,  who are moving there in search for better opportunities. Whatever they say in a foreign accent after spending around a month there. Trust me, there is no need to change your accent. Getting offended if some criticizes India, cast system, religion, food, pollution etc. Can't handle criticism about India. Also, considering cultural difference as superiority of Indian culture. People that visit India, visit a beautiful, or nicely organised space, and say “Wow! Doesn’t feel like I’m in India!”

Well you are, dumbass! It’s not all a shithole. BJP is the saviour, Congress is going to sell our country to Dawood Ibrahim (yes, said by one of my very own relatives).

Motherforker do you even live here? Shut the fork up! Demeaning other people's food. We get it, you don't eat non vegetarian food. But why not keep your 'looks disgusting to me' remark to yourself while someone else is eating it. lol this got me thinking, I do kinda bitch about how there are just like way too many people and how chaotic it gets in India when someone asks me whether I'd want to go back :/ dunno if thats demeaning or stupid per se but yeah do feel that i'll be overwhelmed at the sight of the number of people say near a local train station if I were to come back Hey guys thanks so much for the feedback.

&#x200B;

First off, their 'deals' are usually a scam. Many of their restaurants list their menu prices on Swiggy while calling it a discount. It is their duty as an aggregator to correct this behaviour - which they do nothing about.

&#x200B;

Further, theres a higher than 50% chance I will get the wrong order. 

&#x200B;

My worst experience was when there were numerous items missing from my order and they did not refund or replace but issued a coupon for 1/5th the value of the food. That is called THEFT.

&#x200B;

They claim that 'missing items/wrong items is the restaurants fault'. Hey, idiots, I am paying YOU not the restaurant. It is YOUR FAULT and YOU are responsible.

The worst is their 'customer support team' aka 'bunch of baboons at a keyboard'.

All they do is copy paste apologies, saying 'we assure you this will not happen again', and then it ALWAYS happens again.

&#x200B;

Asked how I can speak to a manager, and the last SIX executives I spoke to kept ignoring the question, replying with irrelevant nonsense, then closing the chat.

&#x200B;

This cesspool of a disgusting, charlatan company should be boycotted completely.

Incidentally, are other food aggregators in our country like this? ",nitaant," It depends upon area to area mate. My experience with swiggy over the past few months has been amazing. Only one time they goofed up and delivered the wrong product. They couldnt replace it so they refunded the full amount in form of a coupon. Thats it.  I have been using Zomato for over a year now, i have not faced any problem till now, i got compensated few times for the late deliveries but nothing much and i have around 40-50 orders from Zomato and haven't face any major issue in any of them. I have been using Swiggy regularly for the last 7 months. I have had issues with them, but they are very quick to solve it (compared to Zomato). Swiggy has messed up my orders (in terms of spillage, missing items, delays) maybe 10 times or so in the 7 month period. I almost exclusively use Zomato. They have the money to give deep discounts and I've never faced an issue with their delivery, except once where I was delivered the wrong McD order and mine went somewhere else. Zomato CC actually made a new order instead of sending me that old pack since the fries would be ruined. I'll give Zomato a 9/10, one deduction because there map service doesn't always give their delivery guys the correct route and they end up calling 1 or 2 times.  Which area are you experiencing this? I've been using Swiggy for almost an year now (2 accounts). Never have I had an issue with them. Sure there have been delays but that's about it. I am not sure about the problem you're having with their deals . I've placed at least 15 orders from Jan-Mar, and I have been able to get Rs. 70 off using their SWIGGYIT code. The code coupled with restaurant offers and SWIGGY SUPER saves me anywhere from Rs. 70 to Rs. 150 per order. And sometimes when I use GPay or Amazon Pay, I get cashbacks 4 days after the transaction. Oh wow, for me it’s the exact opposite. Swiggy is a godsend while Zomato is a travesty. I live in a really nice area of Hyderabad so that probably has something to do with it. I’ve heard swiggy isn’t as good in other cities as it is here. 
Edit: I’ve never used Uber eats in India, but it was terrible in the US so never bothered with it here. Upvoted for the emotions and pain in this post.  Zomato FTW. Been using it religiously for the past 6 months. Always had good offers and the reps were competent and quick in solving any issues, which happened rarely. And when it's some issue with a late delivery or a restaurant closing after taking my order, they've refunded the money and also gifted Zomato credits as a friendly gesture. Uber Eats is not bad either Used to use it fairly frequently two years ago. Was alright Happy Eats Sir ! Using swiggy to order food regularly. Have 0 issues so far.  >Asked how I can speak to a manager, and the last SIX executives I spoke to kept ignoring the question, replying with irrelevant nonsense, then closing the chat.

Happened to me as well, I ended up on call for more than an hour(executive said he is transferring the call) and executive finally disconnected. On contrary I always had good experience with swiggy. Only one time I had spilled food delivered. Other than that if my food is ever more than 10 mins late, they have refunded my money promptly.

They give decent discounts through their coupons. Customer service is good. Just sometimes I had issue with delivery guy because his bike had flat tire or something, but other than that I had good experience with swiggy.

And also once they gave me wrong order but I was glad because instead of pasta they had delivered 8 brownies and 8 pastries. I tried calling the restaurant but since it was late at night (1am) they didn't pick up and customer service was unavailable. I can't help but think that I got some poor soul party order. Well next day I had party of my own with all the free food. So go swiggy 🤣 I have been using Swiggy for over a year and the experience has been amazing so far. They have fucked up the order couple of times but they have either refunded the whole amount or delivered the correct order.  I've been using Swiggy for almost a year now and I'm quite satisfied (talking about Mumbai, don't know about other cities). It was just once that I received a wrong order, customer care was quick to help. Got to keep the order I received as well as the original order which was sent later. Very interesting, maybe it's the city. I have been using Swiggy for the last 3 years with almost zero issues till date. Maybe a misplaced order or two but really insignificant. Mostly on time or before deliveries and I love their app. Zomato has been decent as well, Food Panda on the other hand ... Dude i got 4 Onion rings in the dish called Onion Rings with fries for Rs 96.

Also I got Rs 30 Off.

I wonder if the off has anything to do with it.

I can post the photo if needed. Swiggy and Zomato are more or less the same. One sucks sometimes, and the other sometimes. They're both equals. I've both used them equally from two years and have the same experience.

Foodpanda is the worst of them all. Just sucks. As plain as it can be. They don't have a proper tracking system. Their executives suck big time. I don't know how the company is still alive.

UberEATS is great. Excellent menu, custom menus from restaurants, great offers, excellent tracking system, lots of good executives. But one of the most disappointing downs is cancelation of orders. Once you've ordered, canceling it is very difficult. First they show *Confirming Order*, then it goes to *Preparing your order* in just seconds. After this, there's no option to cancel. You gotta call em up, wait for a lot of time, talk and ask them to cancel. Many a times, their numbers don't work. Either cancel before they start preparing or call and waste your time.

I live in Hyderabad. Here, I think UberEATS > Swiggy ~ Zomato >>>>>>> Foodpanda  The only reason I use swiggy is because they deliver from Meghana Foods.  Pretty much every online service in India is pathetic.

Be it fucking IRCTC, FNP.com or even Amazon.com for that matter.

I recently ordered flowers and greeting card for my father in law as he got retired recently. The quality of flowers and greeting card was so cheap. I am just pissed off.

Regarding Amazon, bloody hell, I ordered a keyboard pad on 5th Jan and it's still yet to be delivered. Today, finally it gave me the option to request a refund. On Amazon, you cant even easily give reviews unless you qualify their so called Ts and Cs.

Irctc, I dont even need to explain. Getting anything done or even the most trivial thing is a big time headache in India. Scootsy and Uber eats are now under swiggy. Zomato is worse... I have bad experience from all of them. They all are same. zomato is god awful in my area. Swiggy barely a hiccup  I had almost similar experience with Zomato. Their customer care don't even bother to reply and acknowledge the issue, forget about solving it. Then, switched to Swiggy. Great service, but food is overpriced. Far less offers too. Now, on Uber Eats. It's almost been a month since I'm getting 50% off on every order. Far less number of Restaurants though. No issues so far.  I used to order from swiggy quite freqently about an year ago, it was great until transaction failure rate reached about 50% and other issues that you mentioned, deleted the app, installed zomato and never looked back. I always use Zomato. Have anywhere from 50-70 orders. Never had a bad experience. They're generally helpful in case of some delay or something. 

Swiggy just feels useless. Zomato is the premier restaurant finder, why will I switch into another app to place an order when Zomato provides an option right there.  Had similar experience with Zomato, fuck these startups. Only occasionally use Swiggy; stopped ordering from them after being charged twice (used online banking to pay instead of cash). Bank says Swiggy has to refund & Swiggy says issue is with bank. 2 months of back & forth so far. Majority of Indian startups and companies fail because they don't value the customer.  Does nothing to solve your problem, but Swiggy has been good to me so far in the past year that I have used it. Once there was a missing item, and they issued me some coupon/offer (I don't remember clearly) in lieu of that. But there hasn't been any major issues and hopefully it continues to be good. I would also say that it probably depends on your area. One time Pizza Hut missed a custom topping, and since I ordered via Swiggy, I asked then if I can just get a partial refund (the topping cost Rs50/-), because the rest of the pizza was quite fine. 

They actually sent an entire replacement pizza free of cost, this time with the correct toppings of course.  Between some Amazon discounts and this, I basically ate two pizzas for 100 bucks that day My experience with swiggy has been pretty good. Prices might be higher but the service is good. Never had any problems with wrong deliveries. Once the quality of the food wasn't good so they refunded me. So I'm overall happy with them.  I have been using Swiggy and Zomato for Lunch / Dinner for past 2 months in Bangalore.

Both have managed to provide a good experience. I have made around 35 orders from each Zomato as well as Swiggy and 4-5 via UberEats.

Zomato with the TASTY coupon (50% off) is pleasing but their customer service is not so good when compared to Swiggy.

Swiggy used to give good amount discounts via ""Swiggit"" coupon, but that has been retracted or lowered now, but their customer service is quite quick and fast. Most of the times they have given me instant full refund for even small issues like a little spillage/missing cutlery. Also, buying Swiggy Super cut short the delivery charges.

Uber Eats I haven't used much cause of no discounts. Most of the restaurants are available on Swiggy and UberEats both so, I usually order them. Uber Eats website and app is almost government-quality.  Dude if you find Swiggy rubbish, you're in for a hell of a ride with Foodpanda and Zomato. Both are primitive when compared to Swiggy when it comes to quality of service and the software. 

But mainly also depends on the region. I speak for Bangalore. In Bangalore Swiggy provides the best service.

To me ...

> My worst experience was when there were numerous items missing from my order and they did not refund or replace but issued a coupon for 1/5th the value of the food. That is called THEFT.

... this has never happened and I have always got a refund within 5 mins of chatting.  As others have said, depends a lot on the area you live in. Haven't had much problems with Swiggy, twice they didn't deliver soft drink eventhough it was a part of the combo but gave a coupon of ₹50 one time and ₹75 the other time. 

Zomato is good too, I keep switching between the two based on what I want to eat. If they both have the restaurant listed with them I just order from the one who's total is less at checkout.  [removed]",Food,2019-03-05 16:05:23
On a street in Bangalore,377,b0j516,https://i.imgur.com/Dvd38JZ.jpg,366,,comsrt," Veganism is growing quickly in Hyderabad, and there are a few Vegan-only restaurants in Hyd and Bangalore. It's great if they aren't preaching, like in the west. Otherwise, it's seems like show off or attention seeking. From some comments here it seems that many randians don't know what veganism is. Neither vegans nor vegetarians eat meat. However, while vegetarians tend to consume dairy products and eggs, a vegan avoids all animal products, including eggs and dairy, and often inedible animal-based products, such as leather, wool, and silk. Vegetarianism is usually a diet, while veganism is a lifestyle. Vegetarians often choose their diet based on its reported health benefits or for religious or political reasons. In general, vegans have much stronger political beliefs regarding their diet, with some believing animals should be protected under many of the same laws that humans are. Veganism is for the rich, who can substitute their deficiencies from expensive vegan supplements  [removed] Guys if you are vegetarian by ethical and moral reasons, then veganism is the natural extension to this. There is so much suffering in the dairy industry it's crazy. ""Gai mata"" is a myth propagated to us so that we never look into what goes in that inhumane industry of ours. 

Look at this documentary if you want to see dairy practices in India:
[Deadly dairy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z33J6TDEv9I) Damn I wish someone did something about that pile of trash in the corner  *none Why no mosquitos? They are the most killed animals by humans. :D cannot unsee the muck lying around... we are so conditioned to it by now [removed] Surprised nobody's pee'd on the wall yet.. runny paint is a great sight! [removed] [removed] [removed] WTF,  
Vegans are the weakest people...  
Medically speaking,  
Vitamins like B-12 can only be obtained from meat.

&#x200B; So no anti bacterial medicine? Veganism is especially dumb in a high agriculture country like India because literally every single crop grown in the country, uses copious amounts of fertilizers, and insecticides, which obviously kill insects, worms and anything small that lives in the field.

If you want to eat stuff that doesnt hurt animals, you'd have to starve, because even rock salt manufacturing kills plankton.

And don't even get me started on the ""organic"" fad bullshit. Most organic food is just normal food with a shiny label and a higher price tag, grown exactly the same way. I don't see plants in there. Why so much bias against them?  You never escape animal use. And the premise of the animal rights movement is much more insidious. They are for the abolition of domestic animals. Which also means euthanasia. Yep. The biggest AR organization here lobbies against animal ownership. And they euthanize over 90% of animals dropped off at their facilities. Perfectly healthy, but life as a domestic animal is worse than death. 

If you take medicine, use any personal products like soap or household cleaners, eaten commercially grown produce, you’ve benefitted from animal use. The list is exhaustive and you’d have to go by individual species we use but in ways other than direct consumption we use animals all the time in our day to day lives. Even if you’re vegetarian. 

The trick is, providing animals with humane conditions. I’m all for lab grown meat. But we aren’t there yet. But even then it will not relieve us entirely of having to grow and slaughter animals. 

Veganism is for people who are rich and misguided.  Does this mean plants are non-living? A cat and a dog. Do vegans really think non-vegetarians eat cats and dogs?  Even plants have life. Don’t eat them vegans Of course, chicken/fish/cow/goat deserve to live.

That is why I wait for them to die before I eat them :) [deleted] Woah hold on a sec... What is a dog doing there..... People don't eat dogs intentionally.... Right? Right? ┬──┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ) This stupidity spreading to India.  Then why vegan only? Why not vegetarian? ",Food,2019-03-13 15:24:36
