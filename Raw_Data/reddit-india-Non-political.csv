Navroz Mubarak! Fun fact - Zoroastrians in India celebrate New Year 200 days after the Persian New Year (March 21) because they follow the Shahenshahi calendar that doesn’t take into account leap years. Happy Navroz Baba log Happy Navroz everyone. I worked with a colleague named Navroz for 2 years. Never knew it meant New year! I have a friend named Navroze! Lol!

Translation: Prime Time With Ravish Kumar, April 24, 2019 | Non-Political Prime Time with Ravish Kumar..

Edit:

Ravish Kumar systematically takes down the PM's interview with Akshay Kumar using satire and mangoes effectively.

""Today I want to talk about non-political things. I do not want to talk politically. I am bored of political talk. I thought I would do something non-political. Do something in which there is no politics. The election is too long. Reporters are also tired. Some reporters did not get a hold of Modi-Modi from the outside and returned. The reporters bent their heads when the editor asked for the budget.""

""Then another reporter was sent. They placed their ear to the ground. Listened to the under-current. This is the change in 2019. The current is underground. Instead of waves there are under-currents now. Underneath the ripple has come. Lou runs above, the undercurrent runs below. So thought that when politics is not happening in the season of politics, then in this season we get out of politics. To do something different.""

Subash Chandra founder of Essel group which includes Zee News, is a MP from Haryana with support from BJP in Rajya sabha. I respect people like Kher more than Amitabh Bachchan, at least we know where their loyalty lies.

Amitabh has been a Cong MP in 80s.

Then was close to Amar Singh and SP in later 90s and early 200s. Wife is still SP MP.

Became close to Modi when he started to rise.

Now hearing he's going back to cong as we speak.

 Ambani bhool gaye Sudhir Chaudhary - Zee TV. Prakash Raj - Congress  Prannoy Roy, Barkha Dutt, Rajdeep Sardesai and Sagarika Ghose - all Congress  i have been curious about this. most americans openly identify with one of the two (mostly) political parties... i wonder if it means that they are officially a member of that party or they just prefer them over others... it would have been nice if this was the case here as well. would have been easier to decide who to avoid and who not to looking at how things are here in this country.  Many people on here seem to misunderstand the word ""bias"". Opposing a current govt is *not* bias. Refusing to sing praises of the present govt is *not* bias. Bringing to attention where a govt has fallen short is *not* bias.

In fact, it's the job of the media to keep the ruling party in check. To remind the public that all is not well. To maintain transparency. To expose the liars.

Things that *do* constitute bias: false equivalency, what-aboutery, lying to the audience (whether outright or by omission).

Also, people are allowed to have opinions. Vishal Dadlani is not someone who needs to be neutral; he's not a public servant or a newsman. The question of bias is not relevant here at all. Randeep Hooda, Virender Sehwag - BJP Me What is this for? End purpose? Mohandas Pai, former CFO of Infosys is a rabid BJP supporter, just like most bigots in India. A-grade hypocrite too.

[Non-political] A/c train queue system implemented by people on their own,1595,8gwqi3,https://imgur.com/x2S75mL,207,,imacrazydude," Isnt this a given thing at delhi metro stations now? Bas kar pagle,rulayega kya ? [removed] All those people who are amused by it this is what happens when you give them some infrastructure.  

With Air conditioned trains the doors are closed and open only when the train actually stops.  So you have to wait anyway. 

With other locals I have seen even auntys  board the train before it actually stops so that they can grab a seat.  No way they will wait for the train to stop because some other aunty would have grabbed the seat by then. 

Now if you really want to ensure people queue up start installing platform screening doors.  But that's expensive and I don't have any expectations from Indian railways.   Fake fake fake! OP paid the people to stand in a line! Only if this was followed for every other train too, every morning is a fight to get into a Churchgate bound train Wtf is happening? In which alternate universe is this borivali station located? Propaganda. Next thing you know they will tell that first people will be allowed to get off the train and then people will board the train. Nonsense. Wonder how this happened? Was there constant messaging to nudge people to do this? How did you manage to travel to a parallel universe? History time. When I was growing up in Mumbai in  late '80s every bus stop south of Sion used to have an orderly line to board the bus. It was very similar to this [video](https://youtu.be/ats8Y1yzgPI?t=182). Somehow the suburbs were always unruly. 

Cars waiting at red light was also very common and so was crossing street only when walk signal was on.

But there was always mad rush to board the trains. This is very refreshing.

 Queue!? ab ye kaunsi nayi western concept laye ho?

Hamare sanskriti mai koi queue nahi hota.Kabhi sunna hai pushpak viman mai chadte waqt log queue mai kadhe the?  If I were first in line, I'd just be terrified that the entire line will push forward at anytime even before the train arrives.  I recently made a trip to europe and I was amused to see how the locals were civil to other people. If there's something that Indians need to badly improve - its being civil to others. That huge fan though. People of Mumbai always surprise. The roads are crowded but flow is always smooth Its because its an A/C TRAIN. CIVILISED PEOPLE USE IT. JUST SAYIN  Yay, Mumbai! But there should be markers so that people can queue up on either side of the door and let people alight properly first. After looking this picture I am crying from inside.  Wait there are AC trains on the local lines? I catch a train from andheri in the evening everyday and this is a common sight only in the women's compartment though.. great to watch.

Also, andheri station is jam-packed in the morning and people had to literally fight for climbing up. The last two months have seen a major change and Now everyone stands in a proper queue Wow, this is the India I want to see.  Haath pe chapti maar re. Oh wait...... that's central line. Don't know when central line will become decent. Good to see some positive story since  ages This can only happen in non-rush hours in Mumbai Locals. 

If people start queuing at rush hour the line will stretch for 2 kms outside the station.  Aaja Bhai Tu Bhi Line Mein This is a very interesting experiment in Indian behaviour.

1. If you somehow project the idea of discipline onto people, 95% of them will follow. 50% of these will be rowdy and lawless while taking a local train but will suddenly stand in line because there's a line expected or being formed in front of them in the metro [I've seen this happen IRL].

 And while the line collapses pretty soon, it is still an attempt at order which partially succeeds in two ways - people can alight without battling through a wave of incoming bodies, and folks who are right in the front of these lines get assured seating/standing of their choice.

2. You will see people blatantly flouting rules, throwing their garbage on the floor etc. on normal train platforms. But our metro stations? They're some of the cleanest places in India. Just look at the difference in India's metros - be it Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai... The cities is filthy, the metro system is clean as a whistle.

3. The security system works. Not for its intended role, but it keeps loose food and drink outside the metro system.

I believe civic planners and govt officials can learn some lessons here. *Rechecks*

Then when the streets are clean the cops will stop beating and extorting street vendors and the poor.  Then that will have a snowball effect, and the road workers will start repairing roads with enthusiasm.  Traffic will move smoother and people will be in a better mood, they'll stop going out at night to rape innocent women and children.

(non-political)",17,8ius6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ius6e/rant_do_we_deserve_what_we_have_or_do_we_have/,8,"Ok, so my classmate from school got a new Mercedes S class. She or her parents didn't buy it, her fiancé gifted it to her. **What does he do?** He acted in a flop movie, his dad owns businesses. **What does she do?** She is jobless since her graduation. Her dad is a lawyer I think, (not sure). But I wouldn't say her family income is significantly greater than mine. For all I know, it might be lesser. At every point in time, I worked my ass off. She, not so much. She's got some rich dude now, and suddenly her life has upgraded a million times.

After a very ugly breakup 4-5 years ago, I extremely hated every female on the planet. It took me months to come out of such unreasoned hatred. But this is the 3rd time one of my childhood friends is marrying a rich dude. I know it is not wrong, but it totally kills off any motivation for doing better in life. This unfair advantage girls have over guys is reinforcing my reasons to hate girls.

I know not all girls are like that. My ex bought a Honda Amaze on her own, by working her ass off and paying EMIs. My friend from university bought a Tesla. But every day, you hear one of your friends say things about girls which only reinforces the belief that girls are gold-diggers. Are they really that pretty? some are but not all. But despite working so hard in almost every aspect of life, a girl from next bench who hasn't worked at all is getting everything I desired. Then why did I work hard? Why should I from now on? What can I say, I'll marry a girl and would be able to afford a vada-pav may be?",killerdrama," There are guys who marry for job/wealth and stuff as well. Life is unfair if you compare yourself with others. You gotta do what you gotta do. Idk who even told you life is fair. Hardwork leads to success. But hard work isn't the only way to success.

You're totally disregarding the fact that guys get dowry. My neighbor works at a bank as a Junior Officer on Contract. He gets 20k per month and his job isn't even permanent. But he lives in a house that costs a crore and a half, drives a car that costs close to a crore and has a bike that costs 20 lakhs!

And he's not an outlier, the dowry given over here are huge and its there everywhere. My mother's friends boast off about how their son got acres of land , houses and expensive watches in dowry. All their sons are average engineering folks from a tier 3 college working for an IT company. :3 Bhai do you have any idea how much guys get in dowry? Their whole life revolves around getting a good job so their family can extort good dowry from girl's family. They get inherited bunglows, cars, fridge, TV, washing machine, expensive gifts etc you name it, and this is out of compulsion. What your friend got was a gift, she didn't ask for it. This way, men are bigger gold diggers. Stop acting like the world owes you anything. Life isn't supposed to be served on a silver platter. You're making excuses for your own incompetence. Life is unfair, dude. That's the simplest way to look at it. I feel like you quite a lot, but then what makes me stop thinking this way is when I see daily wage laborers or these people who do odd jobs, no matter how hard they work, they will never have a comfortable life. I start to think, how would they feel when they look at us.

I'm not undermining what you are feeling by saying the last thing. Like I said, I feel the same way, but yeah. Life is unfair. Hi.

I feel you.

I really do.
An ex of mine left me for a richer dude. It shattered me to pieces. I was devastated. There was no motivation for a good while. I was cutting myself ( I hate people who do it, it achieves nothing, just like suicide).

I know what you're going through.

I find solace in the fact that no one can point at me and say ' Baap ka paisa'. 

I made myself. You'll too. 

Men want just one thing dude. And that one thing is disgusting. Men just want Man Samman.

Its all that will ever matter.

I hope this helped. Life is different for everybody and in every aspect. Why wasting time and mindfulness on comparing yourself to someone else. What do you want? What will you have to do to achieve it? Fuck rest of the world and work on that.

And yes, please change the scale which you use to measure happiness. A Mercedes is happiness for 2 days. Inner satisfaction is the key. Get their. Life doesn’t owe you anything. Life doesn’t have to be fair, life doesn’t have to be unfair. It is what it is. There is no logic or rewards systems with life. Sometimes you get what you deserve and other times you don’t, this can either be good or bad. 

All you can do is, put in your best and hope you don’t get a hot pile of shit in return. C’est la vie. ",Non-political,2018-05-12 16:32:19

Ban Whatsapp forwarding of a message which has been already forwarded by 'n' people unless it is inspected by the company/police to be not fake news or not an attempt of instigating the mob (This will be easy to implement as people never edit the message and just keep forwarding it.)

2. If possible ban the internet for 'uneducated' (debatable) people and only allow them internet when they are properly educated about the norms and ethics of being on internet (Why not under a national program like Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas; This type of **""Vikas""** is in dire need)",sangar-happy," > Ban Whatsapp forwarding of a message

Thats such an Indian way to deal with anything, end all solution - ban, though it may not be effective.

> which has been already forwarded by 'n' people unless it is inspected by the company/police to be not fake news or not an attempt of instigating the mob

This would also require Whatsapp, the organization to track each and every message being shared on their app. At the moment, it has end-to-end encryption.

> If possible ban the internet for 'uneducated' (debatable) people

Last month there was a series of deductions from my balance amount for the so called VAS, none for which I have requested. Activation of VAS went on for 3 weeks in which.I lost amount 5 to 9 rupees and each happens on a day to day basis. I was refunded the first two times. But, as it started happening on a daily basis, I was denied access to  their customer  care dept.( It was denied because, i was able to connect them through other Vodafone numbers)

 I took resort in Twitter and contacted them . They did reply instantly with a message that their executive will be calling as soon as possible. None of those people called. ( I continued pestering them for two days, still those hyprocrites were in connivance).
Only after emailing and doing MNP message , i got calls from Vodafone to ask why i did the MNP messages.( they wanted to know what made me to port from their network [and after all these calls and tweets] SMH).  They did refund ,but only after 2 emails, 10 tweets, and 3 calls from another number.

So , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.

Has anyone got any idea why those hypocrites are doing this to me. Is there any way I can sue them for my hassles? 

",finalbeer," Send the Port message. They will immediately call you. I had this problem a lot. I was skeptical at first but it turned out that it was an App that had ads which would get activated even though I didn't tap on them. It was Boost For Reddit in my case. Now I avoid using it. Are you using any app that has ads at the bottom?  I am in the same boat as you, except I have postpaid. I emailed them and  threatened to not pay the bill and threatened to go to their competitiors if they continue the nonsense of adding VAS charges (which they added 366 rupees this month when my usual bill is 360 Rupees!). They said they will credit the same in the next bill cycle. I suspect they are lying. So I shot back an email saying I want it done for the bill I am about to pay this month. It looks like they have obliged. But, I won't be sticking around with them anymore. They do it all the time. Register a written complaint via email, it works everytime, also it means that those who cannot send email and are not assertive enough (read most of the people) will not get there balance back and will have to way to stop further wrongful deductions. I think this is deliberate and standard operating procedure of the telcos. They do it all the time.

Need a similar thread to collect data on dick and tit size of randians with proof ofc. Nice job OP but 100 isn't a good enough number to get a proper sample. Most people with average or below average height aren't likely to say it, so the average isn't necessarily an 'average'. Just wanted to add that caveat. Nice job otherwise!  How did you know my state? Garbage in garbage out. Iam a midget in my own country 😢 Jesus.... This wasn't about penile length. No need to lie for this one. The problem is most people overestimate their height. It's a common phenomenon. Most of my friends initially would say that they are 5'10 or 6 feet but they were quite shocked when actual measurement (using a stadiometer) showed that they overestimated their height by 2-3 inches their entire lives. Using a measuring tape to measure height might be prone to errors unless you are making sure that the tape is exactly perpendicular to ground. Even a slight difference in degree of inclination would result in overestimation by 1-2 inches. Therefore my tip would be to actually get measured guys. You'll be shocked !!

To reply to all of you -
1. The sample size is, of course, minuscule compared to our overall population of 1.3 Billion people. Actually it is just 0.0000001% of the entire population. So take the visualization with a *chutki bhar namak*.

2. The thread from which this data off of was not a proper survey. So, if you all are interested in a such visualizations, we can have short surveys using Google Forms.

3. I will be making more of such visualizations, since we don't have a dearth of data regarding India. You can check our own initiative here- [Data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/)

4. The data visualization software that I have used is Tableau Public, where you can visualize any data the way you want for FREE.

I don't think I've ever seen cars being towed or asked to move off any road here.   Just curious, what is that place on the right where they have a shitload of cabs? I used to live in that neighbourhood 4 years ago. There were zero normal cabs. The times, they change! Why does it say Indra Nagar near Jakkur? Better than Uber I think, got an Alto 800 today in Uber. I'm 5'9"", my colleagues are 6'2"" and 6'. It felt like solitary confinement in there. [removed] And despite the shit load of cabs present, there is not a single TFS cab.

It's always the case, the 6 Rs/Km cab is a myth. that's what is called a cluster fuck I really, really, really like this image.  You're lucky that a cab is in your area. My area is quite away from the main city and most of the time there are no cabs in the area. One time I had to go to the station and I couldn't find one, Uber saved the day (but with 1.4x price surge). It could be entirely possible that most of them are on their way somewhere else and hence showing on the map?  The Ola Centipede Now I know why traffic is so bad in Bangalore.  Seen something like this on BTM last Saturday morning around 11 AM. It was still 1.5 times, waited for some more time it became 1.3. Then i saw TFS car and booked it immediately without any surge pricing. 

I use OLA a lot, have been to cars couple of times when driver said it is their first day in OLA.

[Non-Political][Serious]: What's your thoughts on GST now?,36,6izxwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6izxwj/nonpoliticalserious_whats_your_thoughts_on_gst_now/,10,"1st of all; I'm not looking for political circle-jerking. I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I’m wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn’t solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn’t pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It’s far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. “Given the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.
",Responsbile_Indian," I actually welcome the One Nation; One Tax system. But with GST, this primary objective is defeated when we have multiple tax rates. But there is hope the rates will be made homogeneous over a period of time.

GST is taunted  as a measure to reduce the paper work and complexity of businesses. But the government failed to address where WE the consumers are in the equation. It was advocated that the less procedures and simplicity in tax returns would increase the efficiency and would result in reduction of cost which will ultimately benefit the consumers.
However, with the raise of key services like banking, insurance, etc from the existing 15% service tax to 18% GST, the consumer interest takes back seat. For service industry I believe they should have atleast kept in a similar rates since there is no visible benefit when you are going to higher tax for the same shitty services.

The governments preparedness with systems is questionable since there were reports that the implementation dates should be postponed due to this. But the government is firm on implementing from July 1st, as with demonetization they are not bothered with the consequences. But this will ultimately affect the businesses and result in lower growth.

As you mentioned, registration with multiple states and filing returns would defeat the primary purpose of GST. Also for inter-state transactions, the government advised the business to continue using the existing forms, so the state border checkposts will remain.

Yes in longer run probably 3 - 5 years the system will mature and we may even have one single rate for all commodities in the future.

  To tell you the truth OP I still don't understand what the GST does . I mean I get the gist of it like all indirect taxes will be abolished , different tax rates by different states will now be the same but other than it I still don't know what it is going to do I think a lot of us cheered its passage, but in hindsight, I really think the BJP should have waited until securing its own majority in the Rajya Sabha instead. As you, OP, point out, they ended up having to make too many mini concessions to get everyone on board, and the effect was just replacing 28 different complicated, bureaucratic AF tax systems to one big one. 

But it's a step in the right direction. In hindsight a lot of Modi bhakts (myself included) naively supposed this was going to be a quick shot, overnight process - I think successive governments will keep tweaking it. Hopefully. Why would inflation rise? [deleted]",Non-political,2017-06-23 16:32:19

He works as a wedding photographer and an animator. I believe that there has been a lull in the level of talent that has been appearing on the indie scene much of it due to a lack of exposure. This guy does it all, he can play the ukelele, sing different genres ( he sang young the giant, he rapped, and he sang raggae), and most of all he knew how to work the crowd. I am genuinely happy that such talent exists in our country. ",AnirD,,Non-political,2018-02-19 16:38:08

Commited suicide on train tracks after getting disowned by his parents for wanting to be a DJ and not an engineer.

Fell in with a bad crowd while at Coimbatore, went on a spiral of drugs and alcohol before his untimely demise.

Mom and dad tried their level best to get his parents to reconcile with their child, but they only woke up when he was gone. His older brother went mad with grief and had to be placed under permanent psychiatric care. The first boy in the class, everyone thought he will be a doctor or an IITian. Went and got a MA in english, now teaching in some college, has a grillfriend and enjoying life. Meanwhile I'm toiling away 9-5 in an IT company. [deleted] went to IIT, i went to another *IT

he went onto MIT, i was jobless

he has some patents, ted talks to his name; I'm here on reddit talking about him :) I was the second last in class. My mom always compared me to the first in class. Let's call her C. C fell in love and married a guy in her first year of engineering at IIT. Promptly stopped her studies. Right now, her husband became an alcoholic because of some financial liabilities. 

She has two kids, recently met her in a supermarket. The girl I talked to not more a dozen times in our 12 years of studying together recognised me and talked to me. 

She lost her bubbly personality and have this calm and measured demeanour. I just wish she does well in her life. 

On a side note, I got a fb request from her today. 
 My mom and dad wanted me to be like neighbour's *beta!* or the first, second or third boy in the class. 

Sadly I used to be in the top 2 of the class, yet they always compared me with others. :( [deleted] Really lucky my folks never compared me to anyone or asked to be like 'someone else'. Did an M.Tech from IIT, worked at Intel for a few years and now doing MBA from IIM Ahmedabad.

Man that guy rocks. One scored AIR 40 in AIIMS entrance, but cutoff was 39. He's doing MBBS in KEM Bombay and has won several international competitions.


The other guy graduated from IIT, is earning fabulously in Goldman Sachs.

(Not that kid but an elder relative) The third is Additional  Secretary, Government of Gujarat.

Though, he's happy with my status In Jail for rape. in some college in chennai, heard he was going to us of a for a MS program. the other grill i was comapred to, took SAT and doing undergrad in the hell down under. the final one is in a local college back home and he hasn't been placed yet in his final year. There is always one dude to whom I get compared all the time.  One of them is doing his masters at Columbia. The rest aren't doing anything special.  Engineer. My mom wants me to do MS .But i know i'm never good at studies .
i'm now having the dream job that i always wanted .

When the topics comes i'll just escape the conversation.

That trick will stop working one day and that day is near No fucking clue. I was one of those kids :( I have been compared to every guy/ girl in class even the dhobi walas kids on hard they study.

Basically, I will have my own website and write content, and promote products. Most of my traffic will come from outside India. I'll get commissions from the US company Amazon, in the form of cheque payments. Am I liable for both income tax and GST? And what else? Do I need to register myself somewhere?",jk1121," Yes you will fall right along with freelancers
You need to pay gst then file for a refund  Payments in any foreign currency will come under export category on which IGST is applicable even for Rs 100 so you will have to register for GST  Our CA told me that we could fetch a bank guarantee and that would allow us to not file and pay every month. That can be an annual process. So that's what I'm in the process of doing right now. 

I would say talk to your CA. I don't do affiliate marketing, but I get my payments in USD to my bank account, it's a similar situation. You definitely have to pay income tax. I don't know about GST sorry.

Edit: Likely scenario is that if you sell via Amazon India, then Amazon will handle GST for you. If you sell via Amazon International then may be GST does not apply. Best to check with a CA - though most of them are as of now confused and don't have clarity on it either. I am in the exact same position as yours.. I haven't sorted the GST thing... How do you do your income tax returns.  How did you become an affiliate? Check with a CA dont pay tax directly and ask for refund. CA knows this better.  [deleted] in same train :p

This just feels weird.

It was ok at first but now it feels forced. Tanmay Butt if you're reading this, tu sannyas le bhai.  World is coming closer to Black Mirror day by day!

I don't mind the hashtag, but the event and all is stretching it. It just sounds kinda stupid and weak to me. Bhaiyya toh kya samjhe ki youtube pe intellectuals milenge?  Unsubscribed from AIB's channel a long time ago, quiet happy. [deleted] I'll happily debate anyone who says PyarEkDhokhaHai

Because I've experienced the opposite What does PyaarEkDhokhaHai  even mean?? Mediocrity sells and AIB are doing a good job at it . Guess now they are the Salman Khan of YouTube. Never followed them or such. They are for urban teenagers who don't have a sense of humour and don't know words beyond bhencho.

 Exactly! It’s just silly IMO  I was thinking this while going through their Instagram story as well. Kinda seems like an exercise in futility.  Please tell me it is just a joke and not an actual event that people are attending.  If someone provides the translation I can also decide to outrage.  To Be Honest, The whole bashing of couples and the Valentine's Day/Week was fine until a certain point. Making light-hearted memes, cracking poor jokes was fine. But this whole hashtag and the upcoming events planned by AIB and others is meaningless and capitalises on the frustration of singles who can't get into a relationship despite desperately wanting to! I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this but I think it's a very clever marketing strategy. At the and end of the day AIB is a brand and they seem to have figured out a viral branding technique cashing in on the large pool of single people who are active on social media.    
   
I'd also like to ask everyone calling them the personification of mediocrity to give me some examples of good Indian brands in the content space.  Can anyone fill me in on what it's about?


Also ,fuck AIB, mediocrity personified. They're finally living up to their name, in a literal way. they have sponsors. Don't take this shit seriously Can we stop having self derogatory memes until a point people seriously start believing it and trouble/judge others if they talk about having a better experience?   

I mean, I have never dated hell I am shy as fuck if I need to approach a girl but I know it will work if I want it to work and try to make myself a decent human being. I don't even get it. Is it supposed to be ironical? Sarcastic? Commentary on regressive society? AIB is still a thing? Finally somebody said it!! Hosting an entire event on that is just too ridiculous.

We text daily - memes, study stuffs etc. She shares her secrets to me so she actually trusts me. I love talking to her but the thing is I’m quite a shy guy so my talks and texts are very “friendish” and not like the ones our college studs do and get gfs so fast.  I ask her about her day, make her laugh, help her out but all this seems to have put in the friend zone.

I understand she’ll need some time but what can I do to make her look at me not just as a friend?  Can’t really ask her to go on a date or something because we both are day scholars and this is a town in india we’re talking about.

3. i was a shy boy: check
4. i am assuming she ll fall in love with me someday: check
5. i was her tampon: check

exactly, thats what you'll be: a tampon, learnt that the hard way, quit her in 2015 after getting tired of her back and forth bullshit and uncertainty, she ll keep you locked but she wont say say, fuck that shit man, no one s got time for that... She sees you as a friend and has made it clear that she is not interested in you for anything intimate. It's best for you to use your emotions somewhere else. If you don't believe me then ask her clearly, saying hey <her name>, do you think we two could be together as a couple. She will give you a straight no. Start flirting with her. Take it slowly but definitely let her get the hint that you are interested in being more than just friends with her. You have hidden your intentions so far out of fear and maintaining this act is not going to help you. Some Chad might come into her life and take her away from you. If you don't tell her she'll never know. She also might have feelings for you that you don't know about. Be brave and tell her that you like her, but be subtle about it. See how she responds and then take it from there. Itna sudhra hua na Bano ki saamne vaale ko lage ki asexual ho Stop being her gay BFF and ask her out already. Otherwise, like the other guy said, emotional tampon bane reh jaoge. She will use your shoulder to cry on and find some other guy's dick to ride on.

I know it sounds rude, but its just the way the world works. Always better to learn the lesson early in life. Tell her your feelings either she says yes or friendship ends. Or she knows and keeps the friendship which is painful. And everyone knows.

"[Non-political] North Indians, what's your honest opinion of South Indians? And vice-versa.",16,2a2css,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2a2css/nonpolitical_north_indians_whats_your_honest/,104,"Probably my first thread. I'm a north Indian but I've been in and around chennai/bangalore for past few years. Overall, I've come across plenty of people holding onto a rather extreme image of the ""north/south people"" on both sides. 
In my personal biased opinion, chennai had been a bad experience on that front. Bangalore and pondicherry have been rather good comparably. I want to see what your views are...",TimeStopsInside," [deleted] My parents are Malayalees, I was born & raised in Bhopal. I can't write/speak Malayalam & I think I am more like north Indians than south Indians.

- North Indians are disproportionately *proud* of their culture, their history, their food & their language. OK, those things are not so bad, but FFS, stop assuming everyone else's religion/culture/history/food/language is worse than yours & stop trying to expect everyone else to put up with it.

- South Indians think they are more their  religion/culture/history/food/language is the best, they won't impose it on you, because think non-South Indians are not intelligent/cultured enough to appreciate it. i was born and broughtup in Jammu (can't go a lot more north than that) and am currently in Bangalore for an internship, have visited chennai, mumbai and stayed in Goa for a month for another internship last year.

I honestly don't see any difference apart from language, i am not being politically correct but people are exactly the same everywhere, Rajasthan, UP, Punjab, Delhi, etc.

if you understand their language and the different customs there is no difference. btata -> alu or po-tae-too -> po-taa-too As a northie, southies for me are:

1) Mostly Polite.

2) Less likely to take pride in being an ass.

3) Peculiar/curious habits regarding food. Like having rice for breakfast. is impossible for me. 

4) Disgusting porn. Most Indian porn is shit anyway.



I haven't lived in any southern state and impression is from various people I've met till now.

 What are people from Goa, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Assam? North Indians or south Indians? My North-South experience is mostly shaped by me being a NRI Guju who had South Indian roommates and friends at my American university

- South Indians are very humble and polite. Even the Southie party types are somehow modest about it, lol. I knew of exactly one douchebag Southie in college. All the pompous irresponsible d-bags were North Indian.
- At the same time, certain South Indians can be extremely arrogant about their perceived superiority. This was the case with my main roommate, A Tamilian, who considered everything outside the very South to be ""North India"". He thought North Indians were scum for their eagerness to be ""white"". He thought of North Indians as white people basically while South Indians are the true Indians who came directly from Africa. He hated North Indians for their lighter skin, big noses and considered South Indians' darkness to be a virtue.
- I actually agree with some of those thoughts. I think North India is inferior in many respects (education, morality, proportional advances made for India). I do think North Indians are excessively obsessed with being seen as modern by the West. *Grabs popcorn* Northeast feels neglected again.  Disconnect happens when one is too stringent with their own customs and language. 

If you are making effort to learn about each other, one does not see disconnect just the varying of degrees/levels of customs. 

I'm from the east... Have friends from J&K to Kanyakumari and Arunachal Pradesh to Gujarat. Few are lurking here right now.

Sorry about your bad experience in Chennai the language barrier does bring in some ugly side of the city but trust me it is in general a lovely place if you discount the heat. Basic Tamil (Tamizl) is easy to pick up. get that under your belt and you will see the difference.

Bangalore has always been multicultural. It was a retirement destination of Army guys. Damn cultured though deteriorating now. Tempers are down because of the weather unlike Chennai :)

Love both the places for different reasons.   Bring on the hate Where is /u/maderchodlungibaaz? i find northies cool. i just dont understand why they dont wear lungi I had a big rant. But after reading what I had written I think it's better I don't post it :( I realize that I haven't interacted on a personal level with any North Indian before to make any kind of call.

But an interesting incident happened to my parents. They had gone to Punjab (forget which city) and asked around for a place to stay. Immediately the Sikh maama invited my parents to stay in their home. More like forcefully insisted. My parents were really touched. Except for one niggle. Apparently the family had this little servant-girl they constantly shouted at. People in TN at least are very vocal about their rights and the servants here brook no disrespect. My parents, on returning to Chennai, sent the Punjabi family a Kancheepuram silk dress. Jerks gonna be jerks; there ain't no north-south divide for that.  I was once Driving in Himachal and was overtaking on a single lane road. a guy hanging from a tempo coming from opposite side yelled .. ""Delhi vall hai Delhi valla""  Apparently he could pick up where I was from  even thought I was driving a car with Himachal no plate, just buy watching my driving style( which I am not now very proud of now) I figure highly insulated/inbred northie or southie tend to run into issues. 
Some exposure and mental acceptance makes either much better to be around. 
That said, you are more likely to meet an insular northie, than corresponding southie simply due to force of numbers.  Weekly Paratha-Butter Chicken vs Idly-Sambhar thread.

Weekly Big B vs Thalaiva thread. I am north indian, who has many south indian ""friends"". I have many other friends from various parts of the country, mainly because I lived in a hostel, which had people from all over the country. While I know, many north indians, tend to have some stereotypical image of south indians, and vice versa, I for one, always avoided acting on any such impulses, and tried my best treating everyone, for who they are. But boy, i was wrong!!. I dont want to be diplomatic here, But really, south indians hate north indians. They dont even want to make an effort to move out and socialise with people from other places. Language is a barrier, but I can cut them some slack there, because they say they are most comfortable in their own languages. But really, in my current group, i am the only north indian, with a group of kannada people. And they cant stop trying to put me down, at any instance possible. This is not a unique experience. They are unobjective, and they think their values are the ones that should be abided by everyone else. They refuse to make a slightest change in their understanding in trying to understand a different person.

The only south indian good friends that I have, are the ones, who for the most part, havent lived there. I know you can say the same about north indians as well. But well, I am just ranting about my experience here, Well, I can't figure out why there are almost no northie guys getting roles as heroes but almost every other heroines are of northern origin in southern movies. Why?  Naan prod Punjabi Kannadiga saar.  I think South Indians are too meek. But they are polite too. 

Other than that they are as much jerks as all Indians.

OP you should have started with your experiences. As an ABCD, I just find all of this so ridiculous and hilarious. Here in the States, I consider my Indian friends as ""Indian"" and don't look at their last names, what states they are from, etc. This is probably one of the biggest reasons there's so much of a disconnect in the country between different people.

EDIT: I should clarify that i'm commenting on the negative comments below on this thread that are being blatantly rude. They have been heavily downvoted and the language they speak in is rather repulsive. i'm commenting on that..I should have been more clear about that so i'm sorry. However, I'm also bringing in my justification of the understanding I have about all this in the chain of responses. I hate your food. Sorry but everytime I try a Dosa I can't have any more than one bite. Even Chicken Chettinad doesn't go down well. And your papad is just weird.

That sums up my opinion of the southern cultures [removed] On behalf of my telugu friend-north indians are very selfish except punjabis. Chennai sux, most of the south indian cities suck. I can vouch for it.


PS: I am a south indian by birth shish :| Raised for several years in Delhi, people genetically 'South Indian' but brought up there are 'North Indian' in every way apart from color and maybe genetic propensity to different diseases. 

At a high level South Indians are more risk averse and prudent. North Indians especially those who come from regions which have seen lot of war in past ( Punjab, Kashmir) have much higher propensity for taking risk. This actually defines lot of other behavior you see and sterotypes you have about either.  Black color ; nariyal waley. They mix all their food on a leaf and eat with their hands. The same hands that they scratched their balls with.  Cmon when u mix sambar rasam chutney together then how can u enjoy the taste of each.rofl. 

To be honest; there black complexion is a turn off for fairness crazed north. I feel this is wrong as north indians are also not true white in compared to european. But defintly far fairer than a madrasi.

Ah south of goa is all madras. We dont know tamil telugu mallu kanada ltte etc. All are madrasis who wear lungi and have fat actors dancing there bellies.

I know they are brainy but are considered as untouchables due to there color here in north and lack of hindi. No one gives a fuck for brain. Its all brawn for northies. I saw my neoghbour boastfuly saying that he will never allow a south india touch his car as a cleaner because it will becpme dirty...i was like wtf!!

I might sound rude; but that is the general perception .  

And wait lack of hindi is considered them to be lack of nationalism. I know for sure; the madrasi coming north will have a hell of a time here than vice versa. God forbid' if his car touches someones car on bisy delhi road....khallass!!",Non-political,2014-07-08 01:33:23

Need guidance from those who have been in interviews before.",3,610xfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/610xfr/nonpolitical_hi_randia_im_a_std_12_student_who/,3,"The title is too TL;DR. I'm a South Indian male in Maharashtra and I have applied to Christ College in Banglore (which happens to be my native place, sort of) for a triple major programme (BA PSEng and PSEco) and my interview is on the 13th of May. Now, this is the only place where I applied, so not getting in will be difficult even though I'm quite confident that I'll get in.

I come from a reputed school and junior college (Smt. Sulochanadevi Singhania School) with what I consider sub-par marks (64% average in 11th, which is the marksheet I had to submit) and I need some help with this interview, especially from someone who has hopefully gone through the same process before.

Now I don't know anything at all about interviews and I have many questions (how ironic) and I'll be very grateful to have them answered. My questions mainly revolve around a general interview and not ""what questions do they ask"" or something like that. The things that I am sure I have covered are my attire and myself. However, there are things that I doubt very largely.

.


What am I supposed to bring to this sort of interview?

.


If I'm supposed to bring a Portfolio, what should that contain? In what format? I'm absolutely clueless.

.


On a scale of 1 to 10, how much can I ""brag""? 1 being ""I am educated"" and 10 being listing all my talents, anything I have ever achieved in life, proficiency in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, etc.

.


How do I convey that I am more than that piece of paper? How much should I keep to myself?

.


I'm not too artsy, so how fancy should my portfolio look? Is a simple, plain, printed text sheet enough? (I'm really good at editing though, so I can handle digital stuff well)

.


How much weightage do my board marks carry? I scored well in 10th and stayed afloat in 11th and 12th. I'm hoping that my 12th boards will be reflective of my intellectual value, so I'd also like to know which standard is looked at more specifically or if it's looked at as a learning curve.

.


I might ask more questions later, so I'd love it if you could answer. Nonetheless, thank you so much for reading this anyway.",DaPompousWiz," * The application form should contain the list of documents you should be carrying.
* Don't brag. Instead, showcase all your skills and talents. Your job is to show how an admission in their college will help you hone your talents and help you towards your goals. So, show off your best Photoshop/Premiere artworks/designs
* As fancy as you can defend in front of the panel
* No idea, but they might overlook if your application & interview are strong",Non-political,2017-03-23 17:55:10

"The forgotten promise of 1949: The RSS wrote a non-political role for itself as part of an undertaking it gave Sardar Patel. The overt political role it has assumed in 2013 is a breach of that agreement and its own constitution, Oct-2013",162,8e198n,http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-forgotten-promise-of-1949/article5211026.ece,10,,bliss_tree," > The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s constitution explicitly states that it will stay clear of politics. **The constitution itself was written, in 1949, because Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel would have it no other way**.

> ... The unstated part of the BJP-RSS relationship was that the Sangh chief, Sarsanghchalak in RSS parlance, himself would not show his hand. **The behind-the-scenes role for the minder was necessitated both by the 1949 undertaking to Patel and to overcome the strong political opposition to Hindutva. The governments of 1977-1979 and 1998-2004 became possible only because the RSS agreed to keep out of sight**.

> ... **Cut to 1949 and the RSS’s undertaking to Patel to write a constitution, which, among other things, would specify that the Sangh had “no politics” and would remain “devoted purely to cultural work” (Article 4(b) of the RSS constitution; D.R. Goyal, 1979). The written constitution was Patel’s pre-condition for lifting the ban imposed on the RSS in the wake of Mahatma Gandhi’s January 30, 1948 assassination**.

> ... On November 14, 1948, the Home Ministry held by Patel issued a press note which said Golwalkar wanted the ban lifted without agreeing to the government’s demand that the RSS reform itself. Further, the note quoted information received from the provincial governments, which showed “**that the activities carried on in various forms and ways by the people associated with the RSS tend to be anti-national and often subversive and violent and that persistent attempts are being made by the RSS to revive an atmosphere in the country which was productive of such disastrous consequences in the past…**”

> ... The letter of September 11, 1948, was to Golwalkar himself. In this Patel lauded the RSS for its service to Hindu society even as he outlined the “**objectionable part**” which “**arose when they, burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmaans …” Further, “As a final result of the (communal) poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of Gandhiji …**” Patel said people’s opposition to the RSS grew when “**the RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji’s death.**” Well. Power corrupts. And absolute power corrupts absolutely.  (Don’t remember who said that, but it fits here) Any lawyers around? Is it possible for a court to cast out the leadership of RSS and give control of the organization to an external administration? If an organization is clearly in breach of its charter and principles, and the current governance structure takes no notice.. surely that’s grounds for dismissing the leadership? So, complain to Sardar Patel? ;)

Update :D",Vickythiside," You could probably keep its kitty litter outside and hope it comes back. Put flyers outside may be. I grew up with a cat who lived for 25 years, and have also had neighbors who have had, and have cats. So I'm assuming I know a thing or two about cats.

Firstly you cat give zero fucks about your neighbor and might have wanted to GTFO from their home as soon as you left it there. You basically put it outside it's comfort zone. So kitteh dear would not want to be there. Cats are also hunters, so kitteh might be hunting and roaming the neighborhood for a few days.

The key here is that you need to be back home, and kitteh needs to know that it's slave (yeah cats own you) us back and it's territory is no more blocked.

I wish you luck. And all I can say is that your meow will be back. Also depends where you stay. If it is some busy tier 1 city, your meow might be a kabab right now. Don't leave your pussy with neighbors man !  If it's a male cat, they are notoriously difficult to keep them at home once they reach puberty. He is gonna be out trying to score some pussy.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.


",unfitforoffice," Wow. TLDR? Wow what a nice read. But there was no mention of famines or partitions. Were they not back-breaking for the economy? [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. 
 >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. 

I'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice ""peaceful."" Have read the whole thing.
The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Personally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. 

Both Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor's British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because ""he is one of us"". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the ""it"" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because ""they stand for Hindu values"" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife's) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.

It is really simplistic to claim Britain ""looted"" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India's wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor's fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he's going to use this wave of false patriotism that's been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is ""overall a good thing"" even if it did help turn someone's life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

As I've been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides, accepting English IS decolonization. Glad to see an academic agree. I can drink his urine straight from source Brilliant.

I understand that there is a huge caste/religion problem in India but tbh i have never seen anyone being treated badly because of it.

I have been in Kerala and Mumbai most of my life in India so idk about other places I wonder why people downvoted this ? I have seen people being ill-treated. It is a shame. 
That actually changed me to other way... Now i support reservation that is caste based. People still suffer. High income, upper class elite have no idea about that and continue to support economy based reservation.  I grew up in a Bramhin family, and was always judged for having Egg or any sort of meat. All those buggers having meat and everything else with flesh and blood will start judging and remind me I am not supposed to consume any of it. ",Non-political,2016-06-24 22:34:53
India's first lesbian ad. [Non political],151,39e6ni,https://youtu.be/Ef27m5ocK6Q,106,,neoasr," Fuck them, still not installing their stupid app. Its a pain to browse stuff it that and it takes an unusually long time to load.  What is this supposed to be an advertisement for? What is so special about anouk that makes it especially suited for this or any couple?

A Zomato lesbian ad could have been much better.

""It's your turn to cook today""

""But I cooked yesterday!""

""Fuck it, let's just eat out.""

Cue *Bow chicka bow wow* Nope, still not downloading the Myntra app If they r lesbians, which one gets dowry? This isn't an ad.. this is a short movie.  This is absolutely disgusting. What the fuck is happening to our culture? How can we allow this? Why the fuck is she is marrying a north Indian? 

Edit: Holy shit, my fourth gold in the last two months! Thank you /u/robojunkie for this gilding Kudos! Although I guess the first one was by fastrack : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmk9D53G6F8 Couldn't take this shit. The Tamil was horrendous.  The kurthas were *meh*.. Good thing Myntra does not have a offline store 😜  Seriously impressed!

Would love to see this and other ads like this air on national television. When more and more kids start seeing these things on TV, the more ""normal"" it becomes for them. What is this ~~ad~~ short movie about? It just shows two people in a relationship where one person is waiting for her parents to show up. I felt that the advt. was more focused on showing the relationship than the kurta! Ads can be lesbian too. TIL. Plot twist. The girl in blue is actually dying of cancer and is breaking the news to her parents.  Good job. LGBT rights are an important contemporary issue and there is an urgent need for a public conversation in this regard. Sensitizing the public about different sexualities is a very welcome initiative. 

That said, corporate appropriation of a social cause is ALWAYS meant for profiteering, and any positive effect is merely incidental, not at all a stated aim. **A good example is how the Tobacco companies targetted women by making cigarettes a symbol women's liberation**.  [A stanford study on this issue](http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2012/stanford-researchers%E2%80%99-cigarette-ad-collection-reveals-how-big-tobacco-targets-women-and)

Basically, if you feel shitty about Myntra, this ad should not be a reason for you to change your mind.  But Wtf is the ad even about?  I like the clockwork orange poster, tho Soooooo... Who ate Chow mein amongst them? As a South Indian, I am impressed that recent movies / ads are casting super hot girls as South Indians.

         I always wondered why companies think they are in the business of giving gyaan to the people on social things in life. 

Sell your products right, without increasing price and adding discount later. Does that require being bold? I dont think so. Uh why are most comments talking about the Myntra app?

Met my GF for the second time at a restaurant. We were warming up to each other when a text came to my cell and she read it. It was from my ""back-up"" long distance GF. Long story short, kissy toh huwa nahi, break up ho gaya. :(

First time it happened ->

Fast forward two years. Same girl. Same city. Different restaurant. We sat at the corner table, hidden from rest of the restaurant. She goes ""Jaldi se kissy karlo. Koi aa jayega"". :P I cupped her face and kissed. :) See Abhijeet defending Salman on Twitter. ek number ka chutiya insaan

I'm awkward with guys more than girls lel. I don't talk to a lot of people though. Plz to Advice : 

Why is it necessary for guys (specially me) to keep on initiating the conversations. When i am just looking at being friends. Why do girls do that? If you arent believing in having friendship with a  guy say me, the fuck do you be a chatterbox once i initiate the conversation.

Experience holders and girls plz to advice . Honestly i am not hitting on them then also they do it like this. Kya hai bhenchod 

I hate it when people throw their fits over me, and then fucking turn off your cellphones and disappear. This just because they assumed something about me? And didn't listen to me?

 1. Indian consumers dont care about quality.

2. As someone who travels frequently for work in India and abroad, I have observed enough times to know that Indian tourists and travelers are, in one word - impolite - to travel with. And this is true for all sorts of transport. 

There will always be exceptions to this but they're few. Almost negligible. 

 Indian girls are the worst for dating and fucking. Like they are confused between wanting a boyfriend and a husband and an ATM.

Somehow if you are a lady, you automatically get some privileges. And if you protest, people think you are a rapist or a molester.

Religion needs to be stopped from turning us back into 5th century. Slam poetry in India is shit and serves no purpose whatsoever. Upbringing of indian kids have gone shit these days. 

The amount of shitty responses you get on r/india just confirms my suspicion.

Would they be banned immediately considering such a declaration would undermine the sovereignty of India?,Saalieri," Indian government would probably laugh at those organizations for purporting to represent Indian Muslims. Ban and throw them in jail. No form of extremism/separatism, be it Hindu or Muslim or Naxal should be spared.  A practicing Muslim can not be disloyal to Caliphate/Umma. 

In fact, many [Islamic Scholars](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Nationalism+is+haram&ie) consider Nationalism to be _haram_ 


>One of these poisonous concepts that stigmatises the Prophet's (saws) Ummah is Nationalism. It is a dangerous concept that has become the emotional basis for the state of the Ummah today and one, which visibly fortifies the division among those who profess to believe in the same ideology. Furthermore, the Muslims identify themselves as Turkish, Arab, African and Pakistani. If this is not enough, Muslims are further sub-divided within each country or continent. For example, in Pakistan people are classed as Punjabis, Sindhis, Balauchis and Pathans. This fragmentation continues to gain momentum amongst the Muslims. 

 Certainly there would be people who would accept that considering we have likes of Indian mujahideen, SIMI functional in india. 

Muslim religion is made such that it is intolerant of all other religions and all other systems, for obvious reasons .
A muslim who wants to stay muslim will have to accept caliphate because he cannot be disloyal to his religion.

This certainly is an important issue and any such attempt need to be squashed. Good Question.  Ask Asaduddin owaisi... ",Non-political,2014-06-19 13:00:02

You can find the source by copy pasting some text from below and googling.

> I am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluation..there are few things u must know...
> 
> 1. GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.
> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..
> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.
> 
> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....
> 
> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.
> 
> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....

> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....

I have seen my friends getting A/S Grade after applying for revaluation..in the end they pay 750rs per paper(Original exam fese) + 700rs(Revaluation fess) Any inside stories from VTU? Eh? isn't this common knowledge? 

in AP, Telangana both 10th,11th and 12th papers are corrected by lecturers coming from schools and other districts and they are paid according to number of answer scripts they check. like 8rs per paper. so, to make money, they end up rushing. 

even OU and jntu engineering papers are corrected this way. 

also, since they come from other districts, if you give latest relevant examples on your answers, theyll cut marks since that example is different from your text book Subjective exams in India , ah the good old days In my Medical Sciences University, we enacted wide ranging examination reforms. 
We tried to make all our examinations objective (see: OSCE / OSPE ) However, the Medical Council of India had mandated essay and short answer type questions and we could only impose objectivised examinations for the formative stage. 

For summative however, we did this:

One Evaluator will evaluate ONE answer for all the students who appeared in the exam. His bias will be distributed equally to all the students. Also, we do post-examination analysis to see if the answermarks form a bell curve. Camel humps and shifts to right and left will make us blacklist the examiner. 

In post graduate exams, the same answersheet is evaluated independently by three examiners, blinded to other's marks. If the discrepancy between the three is greater than 25%, a fourth examiner is bought in and the average of all the four is taken as marks awarded.

It is possible to study the problem and introduce corrective steps, but most of our universities are archaic and very slow to change anything.  It happened to me in my first semester at College of Engineering Guindy, Chennai.   
The lecturer was miffed with our batch and decided to fail random students.   
She awarded F for first, middle and last 6 of students with even roll numbers.   
  
I fell in one of those even roll number and failed, despite having scored S grade in all my internals, and it was my favourite paper.   
Failing first time academically was hard on me, and I was crying in my lecture hall for the whole day (cringe).   
I had to apply for reevaluation to clear it.   
   
That episode was a turning point in my student life, and went on to score few more arrears in the following semesters, and didn't give a flying fuck.   
  
   
Our rating systems are a joke. Being an Ex - IPU student.... I'm not even surprised.  Happened to me in 12th Board.

Used to always score 90+ in maths, was expecting atlesst 95. Got 40!

And guys this is not the first time. Last month they did the same thing and they didn't even text/inform me! I realized that after a couple of months when I saw Game of Thrones airing on TV. 

After calling up their customer care, they inform me that they did so after calling me up and taking my consent?!? 
I wrote them an email stating my complains and they didn't even bother to reply.

What do you guys suggest I should do now? How do I hold them accountable for their lies and stealing?

Eventually the system will sort itself out, but the credit will keep coming. Enjoy! (Did this with Airtel and Tata DOCOMO)  Myself tatasky subscriber since 3 years.
Once, I found almost all channels except the HD ones active. I thought something fishy out there because i never got any call or msg regarding this activation. I immediately checked my online account if my current pack had any modification. No, nothing was modified, no extra charges were deducted till then. I waited for a day, channels still active. Now, I made up my mind that to escalate thus issue if in case they happen to deduct any extra amount in the monthly billing. 
To my surprise, the extra channels stopped after a week automatically leaving the previous pack behind.
Monthly charges were still intact. #इसको लगा डाला तो लाइफ झिंगालाला Stop using them. Switch to your local area. I did same two years back, best decision ever!  I thought i was the only one, my package magically increased from 350 per month to 480 p.m when i called their call centre they said they informed me but no such information was given, when i complained to thier email address no one bothers to reply, when i stop to think, they must be pulling this scam on almost all of their customers and since so fews of us complain, Tata Sky must be raking in the moolah http://core.nic.in/ Escalate the issue and use email to talk to them. Phone calls can be iffy. 

I had problems with the website, where my subscriber ID and password would login to a different person's account. It happened a few years back, maybe there was a backend error? and worst part, these packs also have time validity,

That was the day I stopped giving anything to beggars. This was in Noida by the way. No money. Give away eatables or clothes [deleted] Reading through the comments the correct plan of action could be :
1. Offer food or to buy food
2. If beggar accepts food then offer money if you want to.

Edit : rip formatting -_- Once me and my mom were distributing khichdi outside a temple along 5 rs coins.. And 30/50 ""beggars"" threw away the food in front of me while pocketing the coins.. Thats the day i became a cynical.. 
Ps - and those included ur handicapped and old grandmas even Don't I don't usually pay beggars, because most of the times they are ""managed"" by mafia who uses them to make money.

I live in a small town and there are some mentally ill people living on the streets. Before I damaged my knees, I used to be pretty active and jogged daily. Those people on the street were often hungry, so I used to take a loaf of bread with me every morning and distribute it among them. Never ever give any beggar money.  I don't pay any of these:

* beggars - no matter how disabled or poor they look  
* Eunuchs  
* Smartly dressed person who speaks in English and says they just lost the wallet and needs money for the bus  

Mankind is smart enough to find a way out of their situations without having to beg. Yes.
10 rupees.

Not because I want to give to give him or because he may misuse it.

But because I know people who have been in those situations.

More than 50% of the beggar operate as a group, and may be a part of scandal.

But the other 50% are not a part of scandal yet, If I give them  Burger , they won't join the scandal , at least that day.



ITT: If you don't have a source about the beggars being racket , then GTFO My funda is simple. I give irrespective of handicap/age/gender as my intent is towards doing my bit. Whether they are deserving of it or not is their deal. I give it to children atleast. If I'm eating some road side fast food and a kid comes and asks money I rather ask him to eat for which I pay. I am a big believer in Karma ( not just reddit's, real life too :P). you do good thing. good things happen to you. that has been my experience so far.
                                                For ex. During Diwali my ticket was in waitlist. So I had booked a sleeper ticket from  counter as well just in case. fortunately my ticket in AC got cleared and I had to get my sleeper ticket cancelled on the same day of my journey. I got to the railway station only 40 minutes before the departure time. For me to get my ticket cancelled  I had to take a token from this machine that reads your hand prints and punches out a token with no on it. It was 685. I went inside the  station and the current no that was beeping on the display board 435. No way I could get my ticket cancelled on time. But I decided to fill the ticket cancellation form anyways. While I was filling it a dude came to me and said ""I dont need my token, do you want it?"" Obviously I took it . I dont remember the exact token no he gave me but it was in early 500s, like 510 or 520 . Thanks to him I had my ticket cancelled on time. I know things like these probably end up in /r/thathappened but I like to believe that I received that token maybe because of something good I did to someone else in past. There has been many times where I was in trouble not only financial wise but physically as well but I came out just fine. 

You do good things. you feel good. good things happen to you. If dont feel comfortable in giving money to a beggar may be you could feed him or give someone clothes in winter.  I always pay if the beggar is a child or someone obviously incapable of otherwise earning a livelihood. Maybe they're lying about their miseries, but there is a very high likelihood that the little money you give them will bring more happiness to them than it will to you.",Non-political,2016-01-17 16:06:13
[Non Political][Serious]To all Indian women: What do you think of an Indian guy who has payed for sex? Would you marry him?,37,4cdae5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4cdae5/non_politicalseriousto_all_indian_women_what_do/,288,I know this is a re-post of the question. I accidentally deleted the question. I am not trying to troll anyone. I am genuinely looking for opinions. ,Indiandude_throwaway," Hahahahahahahah you actually think there are women on Randia?

And if they are, they'd risk replying to you? DAILY SAXX THREAD strangely all males are answering this question which has been addressed for females specifically payed....?? [deleted] I honestly find it a bit sad. No, I wouldn't date or marry him.  I would marry a girl who is a prostitute if I love her. There is your answer.

And paying for sex doesn't make you any different from a normal guy, if a girl is turned off by this, she is too narrow minded don't marry her. It's a societal jinx, the catch 22/ Pandora's box.

When we are young we are brash and we do things which we wouldn't otherwise, no one should hold that against you.  High quality Red Pill stuff and quite cliche as well.. But I shall still repeat: 'Men use love to get sex and women use sex for getting love'. 

I don't think women would mind her guy indulging into emotionless sex.. Its the romantic involvement of men with other women which pisses her off.. But again, its not a thumb rule. Over possessive women can create a tantrum and ruin it. 

 [deleted] well women can have sex if they want it.Finding a partner is no big deal but for a guy it is. Its not that easy.    I think it's disgusting, so no. Can't marry someone whose morals don't match yours.  girl here..It would be a huge turn off. It is a sign that he is not able to attract women. It is an almost deal breaker Do you really think marrying means you're not paying for sex? Nice try lol When a girl/boy is blindly in love, it doesn't what the partner has done in the past. She/he will even put up with his carelessness, brash attitude etc., all in the name of love.       This type of question arises partly because of the ""arranged married"" background where a lot of ""judging"" happens before two people actually gets to know each other. 

Perhaps if 'arranged marriages' never happened in India, this question would be like 'do you knowingly date a guy who has paid for sex before'. Which is again an individual choice, but since you wouldn't know if a person has done that or not without getting to know that person a lot, you will be better placed to make a good call knowing all aspects of that person (rather than if they are X cast, gothra, and how strong/week is their family and what not). Dude if you want a genuine answer, ask this question on Quora and not Reddit. 

 [deleted] i'd say the context is important.  i can't say one way or another until i know more details.  in the end, if it is all in the past and the baggage is lost, one may perhaps be persuaded to move on.  

i'd also be interested to know what the guy feels about marrying a woman who has received money to have sex.  A friend of mine(he says the story was about a friend, but he knows too many details). A close friend of mine told me he lost his virginity this way. I am actually quite proud of him. If the urge is too strong, go pay someone and do it consentually. 

And if you want to know, yes I do find him attractive.  Having had a chat with many women about this subject, let me offer a perspective. 

The responses you will get will be most likely be negative. Said guy is a loser, etc or on the SJW side - oppression of women and what not.

However, the deeper reason for this is defensive feelings which arise from the fact that prostitution simply puts a price on pussy, and takes away all the enigma and value from it. 

Men chase women and jump through hoops for them and put up with a lot of their bullshit with the ultimate goal of sleeping with them at some point or continuing to sleep with them. Acting as gatekeepers of sex is the 'power' that women have in a male dominated society, and to every woman, in her head, to get sex from her a man must be 'worthy' of it and must do things to remain worthy. 

Now what if, men suddenly stopped caring, and just bought their way into pussy anywhere from 3000 - 20000 bucks a pop? It completely negates the power they have, and hence they feel defensive and would want to dismiss/discredit such men in any way possible. [deleted] [deleted] If the roles are reserved, then no. If a girl has to pay for sex, then either she is too ugly to get any dick or too slutty, not getting enough dicks. Either case, not worth it.

And if a guy fucks a pros, I don't think it is a problem unless you get STDs or something. People falling in love with prostitutes is not that common, as bollywood makes you believe. Girl here. I have a friend who's paid for sex before, does it occasionally.   
  
Answering this would be tough for anyone because the industry is largely exploitative, but without customers those women don't have an income and are left more vulnerable to exploitation and poverty. The job and its income gives (some) women (some sort of) financial independence.   
  
I'd want to know why the guy paid for sex, who the woman was, how they interacted, and what he thought of the experience. If he chose to have unprotected sex, seemed to disrespect the woman (or sex workers in general), and was sexually/physically abusive, I wouldn't want to date him. If he treated it like any other service transaction and dealt with the service provider with dignity, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.   Are you thinking of getting a tatto kya - 'Paid for sex' :) ",Non-political,2016-03-29 09:31:01

Edit: support for **meat** ban. Not only *beef*.


**edit**:

People think its religious and all. It may be religious to some people. But those people are more cruel than those who eat meat. Because they are trying to ban because their religious law contradict but not because to save them. Without this **compassion** how can one religion can be stated as good religion??

Live and let live!

It tastes good doesn't mean you should eat it. I have heard, human meat also tastes good!

Shubh ratri!",redditttuser," People defending beef ban cos it's hurting life is very very subjective and limited. To our own understanding of things. 

I can easily argue not to kill germs, pests, mosquito's, bugs, cos they are all life as well,.  U wont think twice about killing a. Snake the moment u find it in ur house even though it's considered holy in a certain religion,   My reason is simple, everyone should have a right to eat whatever he wants to. Be it beef or be it a dog, I don't care. ban is not solution to anything in life Will you support compulsory burkha for every woman in this country ? Then only you should support the beef ban on the basis that it hurts Hindu feelings . If you argue  animal cruelty , then don't forget we've survived on that , I don't have a problem with consumption of any animal which is not endangered .  [deleted] [deleted]  Well, I do not want to sound judgmental but Op you should seriously consider looking it from others (non-vegetarians and beef consumers) point of view.
> It tastes good doesn't mean you should eat it. I have heard, human meat also tastes good!

Op you certainly cannot compare non vegetarians and cannibals.
(That is taking it too far op)

""Ban"" directly opposes free will, which is more important than choice of food. Certain things that harm the society as 'murder', 'robbery' and your general crimes cannot come under the same purview, as these crimes are detrimental to society no matter what one believes. Again coming to topic of beef ban, if someone wishes to eat beef and this act doesn't harm the society, then we certainly should not ban it. 
Now you might draw an indirect relation between beef consumption and harm to society by saying that certain religious groups are offended. Why do something that offends certain groups/sect in the society.  Well certainly, all sects must try and practice this but imposing a 'ban' is against the notion of tolerance. If the one group imposes laws on the other, this certainly is a recipe for unrest and chaos. 'Revolutions sneak up on you, one step at a time'. 

Now coming to co relation between compassion and consumption of type of food. There might be something to investigate there, compassion at insignificant levels, e.g not killing a mosquito that buzzes around you, could translate to compassion on a larger scale, e.g. giving away your money to charity etc. Nonetheless, there a lot of factors that go into making one compassionate. By your logic the entire western world and most of the indian world is not compassionate. A lot of people who are non vegetarians have done a lot more than vegetarians ever did. An example to contradict your point would be Bill Gates v KM Birla. Being compassionate is to try and understand others suffering, empathize with them. 

The rant above sounds a like a bunch of liberal, enlightened nonsense, and certainly only a few human beings are worthy of speaking such words , hence to compensate by rant  OP you are a   intolerant, dogmatic, bigoted CHUTIYA. and yes OP I am being civil, certainly more civil than what you deserve. You could have asked for support for beef ban in a much 'compassionate manner'.
Note: I assume you are a jain, and I am one too. I have and always will be a strict vegetarian. Try and be tolerant , and people will be tolerant to your beliefs.  

edit : Wait, was this post a ruse?, is OP just a karma whore?, certainly redditors cannot be so narrow minded. 
 I oppose *beef* ban. I support beef ban because what happens is bound to happen. First of all let me get this point clear- the Ban on Beef was non-sensical. I totally agree. But i completely support it. People have long taken Hindus for granted. If we want to be taken seriously then people should respect us where we are majority. Did u know that Hyderabad( Relative Muslim majority region) government is spending 5 cr for Ramazan preparations. TELL ME WHAT THE FUCK THAT IS. Clearly politicians have done many thing to appease the majority and i believe many more things need to be done to appease the normal hindu. Lol. You sound like an illiterate dumb person.

But, unfortunately a couple of emergencies later the husband was pressed for time and couldn't complete the booking and now they both are sitting at home (they had applied for leave a month back). Now my friend is pretty smart, independent and had a bit of time on her hands. But she didn't do the bookings simply because the trip was to be financed by him and she couldn't afford it on her own salary. Now, the thing is they desperately wanted to make this trip, but couldn't and I fail to understand why she couldn't make the bookings herself and got me thinking - do all couples keep their finances apart? I ask because there are a couple of other red flags in their relationship like he doesn't let her travel anywhere alone or mingle with people freely; especially his friends.   ",tea_cup_cake," Not married. But I recommend the following:


Creating a joint account wherein you transfer an equal amount from your salary for budgeted monthly expenditures. Use this for all day to day expenses. If there is a significant difference in your income levels, you can choose to pool funds proportionately.


Another joint account wherein you transfer an amount that is proportional to your respective incomes for common goals (like an upcoming vacation or down payment for a house and/or servicing EMIs. This account can also be used for pooling investable surpluses.


Keep the rest in your own individual accounts. In our house we both earn, but don't necessarily keep the finances separate. In a situation like you described, I would have gone ahead and done the booking. It entirely depends on the kind of relationship you have with your spouse. While somethings I purchase, the others he does... Most people don't keep finance apart . If they have missed foreign tour they can go to any of the tourist places in India.  I earn, he burns :( We don't keep our finances apart. All of the money goes into one find. Then for an amount greater than x, we consult each other. That x varies depending on how our financial situation changes. 


However, I know people men and women alike who cheat on their spuse when it comes to finances. One dude I know maintains a separate bank account for expenses he wants to hide.  We make most of the expenditures from my account because it gives us a sense of how much we are spending every month. Both of us spending could mean neither of us will be aware of how much was spent in a month. We could have a joint account but we are too lazy to get one done.  You mention she couldn't afford on her salary and then wonder why she didn't book? That's contradictory isn't it?

We have separate accounts and handle expenses separately; typically I handle the rents and bills while she handles the fruits/veggies. Sometimes I pitch in for groceries. We alternate on who handles eating out. Though the accounts are separate, we record all income/expenses and analyze it, makes planning for that next trip or whether we can splurge on next month or not much easier.",Non-political,2014-02-16 16:11:13

Reasons for high prices of vegetables and fruits in urban areas [Non-Political],23,29vvg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/29vvg7/reasons_for_high_prices_of_vegetables_and_fruits/,66,"What are the reasons of increased prices of vegetables and Fruits in urban areas?? I know there are few people here who are into in agriculture, What do you think can be done to improve the pricing of vegetables and fruits in urban areas and also general supply chain of vegetables to bring in fair pricing?? ",nova_soledad," Not into agriculture but the reason they're so overpriced is because the farmers usually sell to the traders (middle men) who push the vegetables into the market at inflated prices while buying it very cheap from the farmers themselves. 

You can see the pricing difference at a farmer's market.  APMC act gives a few traders immense power to set prices at will and also prevents any competition to enter in their territory.

Imho, the best article on the issue in the past 3 weeks. High inflation of essential items in India is mainly due to supply side constraints. When infrastructure development doesn't happen as fast as GDP growth you get high inflation. For example, China, despite being the fastest growing major economy manages to restrict its inflation to just around 4% because of rapid and effective infrastructure development. The secondary reasons are middle men, hoarding and mismanagement which are all linked with effective infrastructure itself.

 When lalu was railway minister,  he tried to run a ""vegetable train"" from Bihar to Delhi.  It didn't last a week, because trader in Delhi decided to boycott it as it would have detrimental to their profit. 
 Mumbai folks, is it possible to buy directly from farmers? Buy at a sabzi mandi or farmers market instead of your local kirana and you will know. Too many middle-men. Even worse when they hoard their stock to jack up prices further. Absence of a a reliable supply chain and hoarding. Man I wish someone would make a bill that read so:

>At least 50% of total FDI brought in shall be invested in 'backend infrastructure' within three years of the induction of FDI, where 'back-end infrastructure' will include capital expenditure on all activities, excluding that on front-end units; for instance, back-end infrastructure will include investment made towards processing, manufacturing, distribution, design improvement, quality control, packaging, logistics, storage, ware-house, agriculture market produce infrastructure etc. Expenditure on land cost and rentals, if any, will not be counted for purposes of backend infrastructure.

Personally, I think such a bill would be too harsh, and should have a finer point. 

Dumb UPA By the way the so called ""Middle Men"" are traditional un-organized wholesalers and retailers that the government is trying to protect by banning FDI in retail. ",Non-political,2014-07-05 15:39:21

Indian serials look gorgeous in HD! So much color. Budget. They can afford to rent HQ cameras for a small promo but for the show they have to use cameras that fits the bill usually a shitty one. Got nothing to do with quality. It's more to do with the frame rate that the director uses to film the video. Ads are usually shot at 24fps which is more cinematic as compared to tv shows and soap operas that are usually shot at 48 or 60 fps. This makes the TV serials look the way they are.

Could someone give me advice on approaching an Indian girl? [Non-Political],16,1xb2ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1xb2ni/could_someone_give_me_advice_on_approaching_an/,46,"I am not Indian. Said Indian girl is a coworker. I work at an American tech company (Indian coworkers not surprising). I'm pretty sure she is Indian Indian (not American Indian) based on her style of dress -- so very likely either she moved here for a job or went to grad school here and accepted a job here and stayed (which seems to be a common scenario amongst many Indian tech workers).

She does this really unusual thing where she goes to the break room, drinks water from a new cup, then throws it into the trash (somewhat dramatically) -- wasting a perfectly clean styrofoam cup that's only had water in it. (Which I consider very wasteful -- it's a styrofoam cup and it's non-biodegradable). It seems a little unusual, but I’m not sure, it could be normal behavior where she comes from.

Though…

My feelings certainly wouldn't be hurt if she wasn't interested. The only reason why I feel the need to approach is because when I first started working at this company there was a lot of eye contact (her fault -- my fault -- IDK). And I have been getting the distinctive feeling that she'd like me to talk to her (though I'm not really sure).

So, what's an acceptable way to start a conversation with an Indian women? From reading about India on reddit and elsewhere, I've heard the culture is very chauvinistic, and that women shouldn't walk alone at night, and that generally woman are off limits in most cases. I’ve heard this from both non-Indians and Indians. And also heard that relationships between men and woman are usually arranged by their parents (and I think Gandhi practiced this, though I don't think it's common practice today) – and so maybe this is why there are no acceptable ways of approaching females.

I’m not trying to be offensive and I don’t’ mean to sound ignorant – but I feel like this is the only way to really gather acceptable cultural practices – through word-of-mouth and anecdotal, folk experiences. 

I'm only asking what's an acceptable way of approaching (as in starting a conversation) with an Indian female -- that could possibly be romantic in nature (I hate saying this..), but without any possibility of coming of as offensive, or as harassment, or in anyway seeming as ""negative"" in intentions.",alphonse23," just be normal! In that sense, our urban culture is westernised. People date like westerners do so there is not much difference in the way you should approach her. Obviously, don't crack jokes like ""cows on roads"" in India and things, it's just not nice. Send her an email

Dear Rashmi,

I have been noticing you everyday throwing away perfectly good styrofoam cups in the bin. As these are non-biodegradable and costly cups, I feel it is very wasteful to throw them away after just one-time use. I have been collecting all the cups you threw away on a daily basis and I am using them myself to reduce the environmental impact. 

How about we start sharing our styrofoam cups everyday from here onwards. Will save me the trouble of keeping an eye on you and diving into the bin to retrieve your cup. :) This will definitely save the company a lot of money in the long run and it makes everything I drink taste sweeter. :) We can talk to the CEO about importing *kulhads* from your exotic native land and share  one kulhad per team. This would surely increase the team spirit and harmony among all of us. I invite you for sharing a cup of coffee, if you want, today evening in the cafeteria. :)

Awaiting your reply,

alphonse23 Q:How to approach an Indian girl?

A:With Caution. Ask her question about [DDLJ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112870/) Read this http://www.quora.com/Indian-Women/Why-is-it-difficult-to-date-an-Indian-girl-in-general/answers/2126033?srid=iQBW&share=1

Ask yourself if you really want to go through the trouble. Try this line ""I am pretty, you are pretty, let's go home and stare at each other."" Indian girls like agressive men. So, next time you see her in the break room throwing away a precious styrofoam cup in waste, you pick up the cup from the bin and shove it down her goddamn mouth. >She does this really unusual thing where she goes to the break room, drinks water from a new cup, then throws it into the trash (somewhat dramatically) -- wasting a perfectly clean styrofoam cup that's only had water in it. (Which I consider very wasteful -- it's a styrofoam cup and it's non-biodegradable). It seems a little unusual, but I’m not sure, it could be normal behavior where she comes from.

In India it's traditionally considered ""unclean"" to eat/drink from someone else plate/cup.

So while she might find it wasteful too, she may be doing so because of her upbringing or in order to not offend others who she thinks feel that way. smear yourself with chocolate syrup and ice cream.





Put a strawberry garland around your dick and a marigold garland around your neck.






Goto office like this. Magical things will happen. [here you go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnGnl-UElVA) Don't do it. You don't want to get slapped, humiliated and labelled a sexual predator in your office, do you? Approach her father. Next time you see her around, strike up a conversation about a shared experience. Something bland and office-related so as to be unthreatening. A coworker's birthday, how you had to park so far from the entrance, the rude security guard, that new guy in HR, whatever. You can guage if she keeps her interactions more guarded, or if she's a little more open with people - based on that, you could move on to asking her out in a way that won't be weird. 

As for the new styrofoam cup, there is a concept of *echhal* in South India (jesus, i never thought I'd spell that out in English) - I'm sure North Indians have an equivalent. It's basically that it is considered dirty to use utensils or consume food/water that have already had someone else's spit on them (this becomes much more relaxed, of course, when it's someone you're close with). So, not saying that her cup-throwing activities are spot on, just that that may be where it's coming from. Maybe you could talk to her about bringing her own re-useable bottle in. Or once you get to a lovey-dovey stge, buy her one :D  Host a party and invite her to it...? 

 Ask her out for a coffee.  She will get it.  Okay, you want to talk to her because she is dramatically wasting perfectly clean Styrofoam cups, or is it for your amorous overtures? Is her cabin anywhere near yours? If yes, act like you'really watching cricket on your computer screen when you know she is walking past you. Even if she doesn't like cricket, it will definitely pique her interest. Don't trust Indian girls living abroad. They will whore themselves out just to get a shot at living in the states. THIS IS GENERALLY TRUE but don't take it as gospel.

Approach her as you would any other girl( Indian girls are the same, they behave differently only coz life for a female in India is tough). BUT be very wary. If things go well and you start dating and shit, do try to know her extremely well. Indian girls are either extremely money minded or extremely simple. An Indian girl who is not money minded shouldn't be let go. They will never let go of you in DIRE SICKNESS Also. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0gnSHIyhfE its a tech company right? Get to know what technology she's working on & ask her help on this. Most girls I've known have a patronising tendency, in any case take it slow. Instead of asking her, make her ask U, as U interact more often, ask her to take U to an Indian movie, ask her to bring Indian food for U, ask her to invite U home to learn how to cook Indian food, if its a big city there would surely be Indian festivalcelebrations such as holi, diwali, navratri, ganesha puja, Id, Christmas - ask her to take U along. If she thinks that others are seeing the two of U hanging together often enough, it'll fall into place effortlessly. Of course when the two of U are comfortably friendly U can ask her out, just ensure she remains comfortable. Best of luck.

Some of the subtopics I am most curious about are:

1) radio broadcast in India (popularity/demographics of listeners, types of shows, are they generally profitable? Does the Indian listener prefer Desi music or a wider variety?)

2) music industry: It is common knowledge that the most popular music is likely associated to Bollywood, but I wanted to know if there was an independent music culture as well? How do musicians typically make music outside of the film industry?

3) what kinds of TV shows are most popular? What American shows are popular in India? Are soaps/serials popular amongst the youth? How is Aamir Khan's satyamev jayate amongst the youth? Are there other similar shows as such?

4) Networks: what are some of the powerhouse network companies? what networks are popular amongst young adults?

5) News. how do young adults get their information in India? what news channels are popular/reliable?

6) Do young folk read the newspapers?

If there's anything you personally find interesting about the industry, I would love to hear it! Thanks for the help, this is the brainstorming session for what I hope becomes an interesting paper. Thanks in advance!
",Sahil_From_The_Bay," 1. Most of India's radio listeners listen to local language radio with local language music. 

2. Yes, independent Music Culture is huge. Musicians make music with instruments & recording equipments n stuff in studios, and then look for labels to produce & market their music. there is a channel called mtv indies i think.

3. do You know of spanish operas soaps ? We have a similar series here involving women and their mothers-in-law. Youth hardly watches TV nowadays. Satyamev Jayate was big in first season, now it is not getting as much promotion in the media.
I don't know of other similar shows. 

4. tv18 is big. You could start there. NDTV is big. 

5. Most news from news channels. some of it from newspapers. headlines today, ndtv, cnn-ibn, times-now. are big news channels. but most of india watches aajtak and india tv. 

6. Maybe 1 in ten people read the news. (ofcourse this sample of  10 folks  are the from the richest 10% of the country.  )

The challenge with the sector are primarily
1) The availability of land. 1MW ( which generates 1.5-1.7 milion units per annum) plant would neceasarily require 4-5 acres of land

2) With falling prices of modules, which pretty much constitutes 65 percent of the plant price, tarrif rates for solar have almost got to be at par with thermal in the various bids that we see. There is a lot of impetus on optimisation of costs 

3) Other major components are inverters (central or string), modules, dcbs and inverter transformers and the pooling station

I have **never** had a single good experience with BlueDart.

Any other courier service, usually Flipkart, Snapdeal, Jabong, etc. based, have been able to find my location perfectly, but not BlueDart. They don't even make a phone call—simply say “address not found”.

Seems like I will have to end up getting a refund from Amazon instead of wasting a couple days more for BlueDart to tell me they can't find my address.

**How do companies like BlueDart even survive or continue to get partnerships like Amazon?!?!**

If these were meant as an income you would have to declare them 'as income from other source';use the exchange rate as on the day of acquisition.

If you bought them on your own then you don't have to declare them (the stocks) **but** you would have to declare any *profits* you make on the trading. These come under capital gains.

",shut_up_chigo," They won't be like ""What is your caste? "" 

They will generally ask your full name just to figure out your caste. 
 Story time:  
I was at a famous gana sabha (music club) in Chennai listening to a carnatic music concert. I was helping a few guys sitting in front of me identify the ragas being sung. After a while, an old guy sitting next to me asks me my name. I tell him my first name. He asks me for my full name. I have initials after my name and I tell him that. He is now desperate.  He asks me which temple is your family temple. People's gotra can be guessed by their family temple. That is the hidden agenda behind this question. So I say that I don't go to temples. He asks me why. I answered that people visit temples to reassert their caste identity and to network with people of similar caste. I also added that I am ashamed to see people clinging on to such relics in this day and age, and that such people should be sent back to caves in the forest, insulating them from any human contact. He stopped talking to me. I usually play the why game that children do to annoy people to get them to back down.

""What's your caste?""

""Why?""

""Just wanted to know, that's all.""

""Why?""

""Fine, I'm Brahmin.""

""Why?""

""Because my parents are Brahmin.""

""Why?""

Usually get give up by this point, but I do remember encountering one asshole who made up all sorts of bullshit about why he was a Chowdhary before he finally relented and gave up asking. 


 If you wanna trick him or some bullshit then say are from rajisaya caste. When they ask which caste is this then say that there were 9 caste including shatriya, shudra and all that

Then diss him for not knowing his religions history.

Say many caste were formed after it. Call him ignorant 

Say it with confidence and  ""chutiya bana de usse""

 Do it for the lulz op I tell them my caste and also ask them if they can offer me a beautiful girl from their family so I can give some fux In TN, house owners ask questions about caste in a very subtle way. 

""Are you brahmin?"" even though I've told clearly I eat non-vegetarian food and I'm planning to cook it. The expectation is for me to either say ""Yes"" to the answer or deny it and say my caste. I always stop at saying ""No"" to the question. And I never realized till prospective house owners kept asking me this question and I kept thinking why is everyone such idiots. Depends on the social situation. If some distant relative asks me something about my caste or native place, i am deliberately vague so that they are left even more curious. Never been asked by a stranger but if i was, I'd just tell them to stfu. 

 If they specifically ask, I say ""I am a human being!"" but sometimes they get offended apparently being a human being is not good enough for casteist bigots. I usually end up telling them.

The question is slipped in so casually that I end up answering it before I even think about it.  Tell them you're from untouchable caste. Then watch them run :)",Non-political,2016-02-11 10:50:35

---

>* MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India has identified 150 truant corporate borrowers whose accounts banks have been told not to sweep under the carpet.The instruction comes within days of RBI governor Raghuram Rajan setting a deadline of March 31, 2017, for banks to clean up their balance sheet with stressed loans crossing double digit in most banks.This is the first formal dialogue initiated by the regulator to drive home the point that banks should not disguise sticky loans as standard loans to shore up their profits.The list of 150 companies comprise accounts where the corporate debt restructuring has failed and where there is a divergence in the way different banks have classified the loan - with some categorising them as non-performing assets while others continuing to recognise them as well-behaved, standard accounts.

>* ""We have received a letter from RBI listing close to 150 troubled corporates accounts which it thinks must be downgraded,"" a senior banker told ET, requesting anonymity.Bankers are worried their performance may suffer in the coming quarter as they make higher provisions on accounts pointed out by the central bank.

>* ""This time, RBI has formally prepared a list of stressed accounts to ensure there is uniformity in treatment of accounts across banks.As of now, different banks treat same account differently even when structure of loan is identical among all lenders... RBI is aiming to remove differences in treatment of loans,"" said another RBI official.In the letter, RBI has also told banks they can present their argument to statutory auditors if they wish to retain any of the loans (on the list) as a standard account.

>* But, bankers fear that since auditors would prefer to be regulators' good books, they would end up endorsing RBI's views.

>* ""RBI does not appear to be in any mood to negotiate on the classification of bad loans.The meeting was called to understand banks' strategy because bad loans could cause some banks to bleed and make it tough for them to raise capital,"" said a senior banker.Data compiled by ETIG shows bad loans have jumped sharply to Rs 3.11 lakh crore in 2014-15 from Rs 92,515 crore in 2010-11.

>* The three majors pointed out that, under FTAs with Japan and Asean nations, import duties on copper were slated to be progressively reduced over the coming years, with full duty-free trade in the metal expected by 2021.

>* The majors warned that this would be the ""death knell"" to the domestic copper industry.

>* With imports of copper products from Japan and Asean nations notching up a 20-fold increase during 2014/15 and, with import duties falling from levels of 20% to 2.5% between 2002/3 and 2010/11, the differential between the average landed price of imported copper and the domestic price had narrowed proportionately from 20% to 2% at present, impacting the viability of domestic value addition, the producers said in its communication to government.

[Non-political]You can't solve my economic crisis but you can read my story,20,7nx36o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7nx36o/nonpoliticalyou_cant_solve_my_economic_crisis_but/,2,"Here is the story,

In India, it takes a lot of guts to take up what you love and pursue it as a career because our parents love us too much to make some risky decisions. 

I am 21 years old now all I did was to follow the path showed by my parents. I never got to know what I love because I didn't there were many options in this world. All I knew was if you want to live a life decently you have to do an engineering job and get a job in a government organisation. 

Engineering opens your doors to the world it shows the all those things you left behind. It starts throwing things at your face saying ""You could have been a lawyer, you could have been an artist, you could have been an artist, blah blah"".With all these revelations about the world, I continued my engineering. I broke my heart, I became a writer, I became a poet, I tried everything in the last 3 years but I couldn't find something which I can hold on to or I can pursue it as a career. Engineering has something for me, it took time but it finally entered into my lazy life.

It took me off my legs, I suddenly felt this is something I can fight for, this is something I can think about all the time, this is the something for which I can wake up at sleep at 5 am daily, this was something I could do all the day and not get bored. 

I started working for The Monologue, NO NO, I don't work for The Monologue, it is something more than it. The Monologue is a platform for storytellers, poets and musicians in Gujarat, India. We are just a group of 7 engineers who have been working in and out al the day just one goal to become the best at what we do. One day I hope that we become the best at what we do.

Most of our parents don't know what we are doing or don't feel that it is a potential career to pursue to live a decent life. I hope one day we prove them wrong too.  

I told you this story because I am the guy who looks after the marketing of The Monologue. I stumbled upon a seminar of Seth Godin(I totally love his ideas on how the world and marketing should be) which can totally turn around the way I see things BUT that costs $745(huge money for an engineering student studying in India). So, I thought maybe someone can help with that kind of, but it doesn't matter now(You read this story that is enough for me). just follow us on Facebook or Instagram search for "" Themonologuein"" that will mean the world to me.

P.S: One day we will host an event in your city ",venkatb10, Followed on Instagram. ,Non-political,2018-01-04 03:41:20

[Non-Political] Update: Udta Punjab - CBFC issue.,6,4n477u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4n477u/nonpolitical_update_udta_punjab_cbfc_issue/,6,"The issue has just taken an interesting turn. 

1. Anurag Kashyap (AK) had apparently alleged yesterday that Pahlaj Nihalani (PN) & Co. had not given them their decision including the list of required cuts in writing. PN just said in an interview that AK & Co. were scheduled to collect it yesterday (June 7) morning. However, they did not do so and later in the day went to the media and said that CBFC had not given them the certificate. Now, the same has been collected by them today.

2. AK said that CBFC ordered them to remove 'Punjab' from the film title. PN says they never asked AK & Co. to change the film title and that AK is only doing that for publicity. 

And now for some extremely shoddy reporting from India Today (IT) (which I had some respect for before today):

A. PN specifically said in the interview (which IT showed like a hundred times continuously like every Indian news channel always does) that during his tenure, 72% of the films have been allowed without any cuts. India Today reported that PN claims that CBFC has approved 72% of Udta Punjab.

B. AK had made some wild allegations against PN including stating that he (PN) was a megalomaniac. PN unequivocally stated that he hasn't met AK after Bombay Velvet. IT, grossly twisting this, reports (quoting PN) that PN has NEVER met AK.

Now, yesterday, I was insanely furious against PN & Co. after watching my favourite director's (AK, not PN) passionate appeal in the interview. However, if I had watched only IT reports without having seen the interview, I would be fully pissed and transform into my keyboard-warrior mode against PN & Co. However, the shoddy reporting by IT makes me a bit skeptical about how much of this whole story, as portrayed by AK & Co. and the reporting by IT (usually), is exactly as true as they say it is.",bojackarcher, So you believe what PN is saying to be true.

[Non Political],17,278hal,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/278hal/is_it_possible_to_earn_a_bachelors_degree_in_law/,13,,kenadamas," No. It's not possible. Even if any university is offering it don't fall for it because it won't be recognised by the Bar Council of India and so won't be eligible to be enrolled as an advocate.You can pursue only LLM through correspondence. Might be possible, people are getting b tech degrees from correspondence courses yes possible.

However, it looks like the Bar Council doesn't recognize LLB degrees. But there seem to be diploma courses in job-specific law topics that you can pursue in order to improve your knowledge of topics such as patents law and cyber laws.

[Non-political] Update to the Amazon-Bluedart issue I had a week back,19,2civ1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2civ1p/nonpolitical_update_to_the_amazonbluedart_issue_i/,13,"[First post](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2c1tsb/nonpolitical_i_was_all_excited_to_start_using/)

Update:

I contacted Amazon about the issues I’ve had with Bluedart and how I was going to end up disappointed with my first Amazon.in purchase. I was pleasantly surprised when I got a reply in a few hours (way before their 24 hour wait period for emails). They promised me that the couriering will complete in time and they will prevent any such issues from happening again.

I ended up getting two Bluedart and one Fedex package in the next couple days. This is the *first time* that Bluedart has been able to “find” my address, LOL!

Let me also add, this Amazon email I got as a reply was one of those rare customer service emails that didn't sound self-defensive but really genuine and helpful—when something wrong was pointed out against the company.

Thanks for your thoughts in the previous post, guys.

[Non Political] Animal Abuse Need Your Help r/india,1,4kyaoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4kyaoc/non_political_animal_abuse_need_your_help_rindia/,5,"Yesterday on 24 May 2016, a group of innocent puppies were brutally tortured, rounded up and taken away in vans in Diamond City West, Behala, Kolkata. These pups were born here and were living peacefully for months. I had personally grown them up.

*names edited out*. However, both are denying involvement in this event. Furthermore, on peacefully informing them that I proof regarding their involvement, they are threatening to the put the blame on me itself, claiming that i am responsible for rounding up the dogs, and that all the residents of the complex will also claim the same.

I am therefore, completely shocked and heartbroken, at this complete lack of regard for life, and the dirty politics being played. I have tried emailing animal welfare organisations and national newspapers, but i haven't got a reply from any of them. Therefore i come to reddit as a last resort, in hoped of getting justice for those poor souls who did nothing wrong and yet were denied their very existence.
Here are some pictures of the process that happened right in the complex - http://imgur.com/a/AfNQY
Thank you.",Nova96," Holy Hell!! That is terrible :( Such unnecessary measures for some tiny defenceless puppies.

I don't know enough to help you, but please let us know if there is a resolution to this. Have you tried tagging any animal welfare organisations on twitter along with photos of this incident?

India needs more people like you who don't sit quietly while such atrocities are committed. Not only are both the acts of cruelty and the subsequent attempts at intimidating you terrible, they are both highly also illegal and in contempt of court.

Here are all the pertinent laws and court rulings for you to take up a case with the police, media, and a lawyer. Don't back down, you are fully within your rights, and have proof of the acts of cruelty, the people who have claimed responsibility in writing, and their attempts to intimidate you. 

You have witnessed a crime and they have tried to silence you, don't let them succeed.

As per Indian law, **street dogs cannot be beaten, killed or driven away or displaced or dislocated**, they can only be sterilized in the manner envisaged in the The Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001  enacted under the Indian Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960 (A Central Act), vaccinated, and then returned back to their original locations.

Rule 6 and Rule 7 of The Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001, state as follows:

> Rule 6 clearly envisages that **even if the Municipal Corporation thinks it expedient to control street dog populations; IT CANNOT RESORT TO KILLING OR DISLOCATING**. 

> It can only sterilize and immunize the dogs, and then **leave them at the locations that they had been picked up from**.

> Rule 7 deals with the procedure to be followed upon receipt of a complaint. Please also note, **the Municipality, cannot just pick up dogs, simply because some persons/administrators don’t like their being around**. 

> Even the **dogs that are complained about can only be sterilized and immunized, and then left back at the locations that they had been picked up from**.

Please note **there is a specific bar against dislocating dogs**, since the same tends to interfere with and jeopardize the area-wise animal birth control. **For the area-wise sterilization program mandated by law, dogs have to be returned back to their original habitat** after sterilization and immunization. These dogs then tend to fight off other, newer, possibly unsterilized and unvaccinated dogs from entering their territories, since dogs are highly territorial in nature. 

> Dislocation of street dogs has time and again proven to be counter-productive and only favours the entry of other non-sterilized street dogs into the area, which will not only be unknown to you but also to those who tend to the area’s street dogs, thus raising more cases of man-animal conflict.

**Ministry of Public Grievances Circular on Street Dogs to Central Govt Employees dated 26.5.2006**

**The Stray feeding guidelines by the Department of Personnel & Training, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, New Delhi letter no.F.No.30/9/2006-WELFARE dated 26.5.2006, applicable for:**

> Treatment of street dogs by government servants: If any Govt. Servant indulges in act of cruelty to animals he will be making himself liable for action under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Besides, punishment under the Act, he would also make himself liable for action under CCS (Conduct) Rules for conduct unbecoming of a Govt. Servant.

> Resident Welfare Associations, citizens and others: Stray animals are to be dealt with through designated agencies in Govt./local self-government organizations/ NGO’s etc.  Recognised Associations in Govt. colonies may approach such Institutions for redressal of their grievances. All the problems of stray animals have to be handled within the institutional framework available and NO resident association, recognized or unrecognized, shall take recourse to action on their own, either themselves or through any person employed by them like security guards etc.

**The Delhi High Court, vide its rulings in 2009 and 2010, have also actually ordered the Police to protect persons who feed and care for street dogs, and who are often exposed to the ire of ill-informed, ill-advised residents/administrators of those areas.**

> The Delhi High Court in its judgement, pronounced on 18.12.2009 and 4.2.2010, says that “it is necessary to bring into record that these individuals and families who adopt stray animals are doing a great service to humanity as they are acting in the aid and assistance of Municipal Authorities by providing these animals with food and shelter and also by getting them vaccinated and sterilized. Without assistance of such persons no local Municipal Authority can successfully carry out its ABC programme”.

> The Court has proceeded to say that “the local police and the municipal authorities are under obligation not only to encourage such adoption but also to **ensure protection to such persons who come forward to take care of these animals specifically the community or neighbourhood dogs so that they are not subjected to any kind of cruelty”**, finally, the Court has said “that every individual has the right to live his life in the manner he wants and it is necessary that the society and the community recognize it”.

Also remember that under the Indian laws, animal cruelty is an offence – under Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, and Section and 429 of the Indian Penal Code – punishable with imprisonment and fine. Likewise, **criminal intimidation, and criminally intimidating animal welfare volunteers is a serious offence under the Indian Penal Code (specifically, Section 503 of Indian Penal Code read with Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code 1860).**

I would also highly recommend going reaching out to this organisation for help and advice.

But most importantly, now that you are armed with the laws and know your rights, go to the police and/or get a lawyer (to file a case of both animal cruelty and criminal intimidation). 

PRINT THIS OUT and take it with you, so that you can show them the laws in writing and they take you seriously.

I contacted spca regarding this matter, and was told to file an fir and give a copy to them. However, on consulting some other people who share my cause and are more knowledgeable than me, we decided that we should instead come up with some policies that are favourable to both sides.

Meanwhile, I am happy to know from some people that the images have gone somewhat viral, and the opposition is now calling them to be fake. However that can be easily countered because the photos have cars with their number plates showing, and even some residents in them. Guess they're just grasping on straws now.

Staying in India for roughly 10 days (New Delhi area).. a few questions? [Non-Political],6,2hx08j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2hx08j/staying_in_india_for_roughly_10_days_new_delhi/,10,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I figured it'd be fitting. 

So I'll be in India for about 10 days roughly, and I'm coming from Canada (Vancouver). I'm of Indian origin, so not really white or anything, although I'm pretty pale, but regardless, still look Indian. Anyways, I'll be in Delhi for the most part and was just wondering how safe it is. I kind of want to be away from my family as I'm 17 and well you know how it is. Anyways, I speak English as my only language, although I can speak Hindi, just with a very western accented voice, and I can understand most of it. Anyways, are there any genuine safety concerns or anything of that nature? Will I be treated differently because of my voice? I'm a pretty big guy (almost 2 metres) tall so I'm not like tiny or anything either if it is indeed dangerous. Also, what are some suggestions for someone like me to do? I'm at a complete loss but I don't get to visit India too often, so I'd like to do something with my short stay here. Thanks!

",INeedYourLyrics," even if you speak Hindi your accent will give you away so don't act like you're a local, own the NRI thing. Try to stick to radio cabs (Meru or Wings) especially late at night, and don't flash foreign currency. Stay away from the Ganj areas of Delhi or you might wake up missing a kidney... do. not. take. food. from. strangers. and unless you've eaten street food in Delhi before, i very strongly urge you to research ""Delhi Belly"", and watch the movie too while you're at it.

That being said, there are a LOT of safe, fun places in Delhi - India Habitat Centre, Hauz Khas village, India Gate and the surrounding historical monuments, Chandni Chowk, Connaught Place, and even the Bangla Sahib gurudwara has magnificent architecture, if you're into that sort of thing.

Delhi, being a longtime capital of India, is a city of vibrant history and a cultural salad bowl, as opposed to a cultural melting pot. A lot of this history and culture can be found in the gardens on every corner, or in the old time coffee houses in Connaught Place, or any one of the hundreds of bazaars littering the NCR.

if you don't already know the places you want to go to, you might consider purchasing the latest lonely planet.

Bharat me aapka swagat hai. krupaya jahaaz rukne tak apne kursi ki peti bandhe rakhe bhosadike. Chill and dont do anything stupid like picking a fight or showing off money. No worries. It's pretty safe for guys. Choose the right hotel for stay.  You will be bigger than 95% of the people around you, so you wont be in any real danger. Don't eat any raw food, drink only bottled water, rinse your mouth and brush your teeth with bottled water, keep a small bottle of hand sanitizer on you and use it every time you touch a door knob etc. Bring your own toilet paper. Use a plug in mosquito repellent (such as allout, goodknight.. These are Indian brands you will be able to get in any general store for dirt cheap. And they can save your life.) Don't flash a lot of money or valuables such as expensive cameras/laptops. 

Delhi should be fairly safe for you but 10 days just in Delhi may be a bit much. You can travel to Jaipur, Ranthambhor national park (in Sawai Madhopur), Agra, all of which are close to Delhi and are spectacular.

Yoga Travelling in India [Non-Political],3,2g07zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2g07zl/yoga_travelling_in_india_nonpolitical/,19,"Dear /r/india[1] ,

Escuse me for bothering you with a travel related question. Furthermore I understand that some of you are tired of 'westeners in yoga pants'. Please understand that I am not visiting your country out of an idea that you are nothing more than a spritual country.

With this said I am seeking your advice.

I am an european male travelling to India in about a month time. I have heard many good stories from friends who have been in your country. I will be in India for about 6 months (October - April) I think. If money and desire suffices.

I want to experience India as a country; culture, food, people etc. But one of my main plans is to find a good place for yoga. Ideally I would find an ashram where I could stay for 2-3 months. Maybe, if it's possible I would like to do a teacher training course, mainly because I want to deepen my own practice but maybe, some day, I could be interested in teaching.

BUT when I try to find places online it is really hard to determine the quality of the courses and, of course, I do not like being ripped of/wasting my time.

As I understand there are many places in India for yoga. Rishikesh, Varanasi, Mysore are the main ones that I have come upon.

I almost decided on not booking anything in advance and then travelling to a yoga city to find a course.

In this regard, do you have any advice? Cities? Specific ashrams? Ways to approach this?

I have tried in /r/yoga . I have tried different yoga forums. I have tried google. All without much result.

I really appreciate your help.",TravelWithYoga," I may be a bit biased since I lived in Pune when I was younger and have a soft spot for the city. There are a lot of nice Yoga retreats/ashrams in Pune. Here's two that you can be fairly confident will meet or exceed your expectations:

1. [Osho](http://www.osho.com). They have a very peaceful, clean retreat. I have heard that they offer work/live programs where you can volunteer and have some of the dues paid off that way.
2. [RIMYI](http://www.bksiyengar.com/modules/institut/rimyi/rimyi.htm). This is B. K. S. Iyengar's Yoga retreat. Mr. Iyengar passed away recently. The Institute is dedicated to his wife. Not sure if they have classes.

There might be others that I don't know about. Seems like you are open to experiences and not afraid of trying things out. Pune would be ideally suited for something like that. It's metropolitan enough that if you wish to have a burger, you can pop over to MdDs, but you can also find an authentic thaali if you desire.

Don't know about your budget, but you can find the typical Hyatts and Le Meridians, but there are also homestays etc. Again, I'm not that knowledgeable of these things. Google ""Rishikesh"" , your yoga related problems will be solved . In the outskirts of Bangalore city there is a very good Yoga Teaching Institute. Its called SVYASA. 
Visit this link for more info: http://svyasa.edu.in/
They have a 1 month course of Yoga Instructors Course.
 I have heard Vipassana has helped a lot of people. It is pretty intense and can run from 10 to 30 days. Some info below:
http://goindia.about.com/od/yogawellbeing/tp/Top-5-Vipassana-Meditation-Centers-In-India.htm
http://www.vridhamma.org/Courses-Schedule-in-India

There are a few blogs online that share details on the course. I practice Jivamukti Yoga and can vouch for the authenticity.  They have retreats in India. This might be helpful in giving you a direction.

These are some uninspiring thoughts when we have poured in years of work to learn, unlearn, build, dismantle, and assemble again. 

Some jumping ship, some hanging around fighting for the cause; begging, borrowing, appropriating, somehow, you do everything to never let doubts creep into your mind. 

Some nights are spent, staring at a blank screen, unresponsive code, a sad prototype of the dream that you chase.

Some days are spent, evaluating yourself, if the sum total of your life was a failure that was staring you in the face each day, each night. Your self-worth becomes zero, you become completely undesirable to people who probably loved you once, you have already jerked off to all the porn that you could handle.

By this time, all your friends have become your creditors, with lines of credits exhausted, you scroll your contact list constantly to find that one person, not to seek funds, but to talk with.
We try to hark back for simpler times, reminiscence the moments that made us laugh, then, but we hope probably it would bring an honest smile to our face – our smiles that we had pawned off we did not know when, to users, downloads, sessions and GMVs.

Then one day, you come home, stare at the blank screen, try to make sense of things, break down, and just before letting go of everything seems like an option. You think of Ali, you think of Lincoln, you seek wisdom in the hymns of Nanak, and sagacity and enlightenment from Bhagvad Gita; but you know who comes to your rescue, Earnest Hemingway.

*You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.*

To further (mis)quote Hemingway, sometimes our actions are not immediately discernible and when we try for something beyond attainment, something that has never been done, and things that others have tried and failed, and perhaps with ‘karma’ you will succeed.

I guess Andy Dufresne was right, it does come down to a simple choice really. Get busy living or get busy dying.",picturesingh," OP, do not continue your business because you buy into what I call as ""success porn"" where one is constantly bombarded with motivational quotes and stories of entrepreneurs rescuing businesses from the brink of their death.

Take a calm, logical look at your situation separating emotion from the process completely. If you were just handed this business today, what would you do? Sometimes shutting down your business is the right thing to do.  Upvoting for visibility in the hope some experienced hand pours some wisdom. Business is harrrd! 

And for most times, once you're in, there really is no easy exit. 

I have no advice for you, but I congratulate you for the 2 or 3 houses (staff) you feed and wish you all the best.   if money is the only problem, in all seriousness i am eager to hear.
The biggest problem is finding people like you who have the will / desire to succeed and money becomes the problem.
PM me if you would be open to a discussion and if i am getting it right. Many Thanks for sharing this, OP. It was deep. 

*""You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.""*

I have always been motivated by below shabad for Guru Gobind Singh: I am sure, you would have heard of it. 

""ਦੇਹ ਸਿਵਾ ਬਰੁ ਮੋਹਿ ਇਹੈ ਸੁਭ ਕਰਮਨ ਤੇ ਕਬਹੂੰ ਨ ਟਰੋਂ ॥ ਨ ਡਰੋਂ ਅਰਿ ਸੋ ਜਬ ਜਾਇ ਲਰੋਂ ਨਿਸਚੈ ਕਰਿ ਅਪੁਨੀ ਜੀਤ ਕਰੋਂ ॥ ਅਰੁ ਸਿਖ ਹੋਂ ਆਪਨੇ ਹੀ ਮਨ ਕੌ ਇਹ ਲਾਲਚ ਹਉ ਗੁਨ ਤਉ ਉਚਰੋਂ ॥ ਜਬ ਆਵ ਕੀ ਅਉਧ ਨਿਦਾਨ ਬਨੈ ਅਤਿ ਹੀ ਰਨ ਮੈ ਤਬ ਜੂਝ ਮਰੋਂ ॥੨੩੧॥ [1]

If you can't read Punjabi: 

""Deh siva bar mohe eh-hey subh karman te kabhu na taro. Na daro arr seo jab jaye laro nischey kar apni jeet karo. Arr Sikh ho apne he mann ko, eh laalach hou gun tau ucharo. Jab aav ki audh nidan bane att he rann me tabh joojh maro.""



Good luck dude, wish you lots of prosperity.  Cool writeup OP. I am in the same boat so can empathize. Some of the things that seem to work for me:

1. Dont spend too much time on social media - comparing your life with someone else's on facebook is going to make you feel a lot worse. Everyone is fighting their own battle. Your battle might be harder, but you are also built stronger, so its only fair.

2. Do something to tune out completely for say a week/10 days every 3 months. When I say tune out, you should be extremely engaged in something completely unrelated - like music or some sport or some travel. Thinking about the same business ALL the time structures your thoughts in a certain way. Breaking this pattern by doing something unrelated and then coming back to look at the business has given me some amazing insights. 

3. Sometimes business hits a wall. Consider letting it go for sometime like a few months. Dont decide on anything but just focus on something else - it could be another idea, or could be a small job, or some remote work. Sometimes the only thing a business needs is time for it to reveal itself. 

4. Consider psychotherapy. In India this is kinda looked down upon, but this one thing can dramatically improve your self being. Having someone to open up to completely helps you evaluate your thoughts better and helps you make sense of what you are doing. The awesome thing about India is that psychologists are ridiculously cheap - you can get someone with shitload of phds to hear you out for a pittance. 

5. Try reading about stoicism. That one thing has dramatically changed my perspective on life and has been the single biggest source of happiness for me. 


 Great advice all around! I am going through a phase where I am penning down all my thoughts for a startup. I will use this perspective and advice to prepare myself and my family for the hardships. Good luck!  and where are you now?

curious... Well as long as we're furiously name dropping and quoting people...

>Everybody knows by now, all businessmen are completely full of shit; just the worst kind of low-life, criminal, cocksuckers you could ever wanna' run into - a fuckin' piece of shit businessman. And the proof of it, the proof of it is, they don't even trust each other. They don't trust one another. When a business man sits down to negotiate a deal, the first thing he does is to automatically assume that the other guy is a complete lying prick who's trying to fuck him outta his money. So he's gotta do everything he can to fuck the other guy a little bit faster and a little bit harder. And he's gotta do it with a big smile on his face. You know that big, bullshit businessman smile?

"Hinduism, conversion and the neutrality of the Indian Secular State: a non-political, theological exploration",0,2qlsrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2qlsrb/hinduism_conversion_and_the_neutrality_of_the/,9,"tl;dr:

* Pagan traditions and Semitic religions are fundamentally different manifestations of religiosity. 

*  Traditions are difficult to proselytize because they do not consider other traditions as false. 

* Semitic religions believe that some religions are indeed false and so encourage and facilitate conversion. 

* The Indian state sees Hinduism as just another semitic religion. 

* The Indian state by allowing conversion is working within a Christian theological framework. It is not being neutral.  



Full length:

In India, we have two different kinds of religions: Pagan or Dharmic or Indic traditions (Hindu, Jain and Buddhist traditions) and Semitic or Abrahamic religions (Islam and Christianity). 

Hindu traditions exist because they are passed down from one generation to the other. Such traditions do not actively seek converts because they do not entertain the notion that other people follow false gods or have false religions. 

Such traditions see things like devas or puja pr bhakti as familial or traditional practices. They are followed in order to maintain some continuity between different generations, not because they contain some grand and timeless truth. The practioners of such traditions might try to justify their actions (a Durga bhakt would say that she is worshiped because she killed a powerful demon).  Such justifications are mostly offered to outsiders (non-bhakts or non-hindus) and are not theologically consistent. 

Observing ancestral practices need not be justified logically just as there is nothing logical about writing a sonnet using just 14 lines. Why 14? Its just tradition. There is nothing scientific or logical about it. 

 Semitic religions (namely Islam and Christianity) spread partly as ancestral practices and partly through conversion.

 Islamic and Christian theologians try (not always successfully of course) to be logically consistent because they  think that they are after some grand and timeless truth. Using the God-given faculty of Reason, they want to understand the nature of Creation and the Creator. Conversion makes sense to Muslims and Christians because they think there are false religions and false gods. And the people who worship such false gods will be punished after they die by the True God. To save the “heathen”, Muslims and Christians are encouraged to engage in proselytization and conversion. 

The heathen needs to be saved from his own spiritual blindness.
 

Indian secularism is defined as equal respect and equidistance from all religions. The secular state sees Hinduism as just another Semitic religion with an internally consistent theology containing a singular grand Truth. So a Brahmin is just another kind of Priest, and Gita another kind of “religious” text like the Quran. Having confused tradition with religion, the Indian state allows for proselytization thinking that it is possible to convert people from one tradition to the other. 


By allowing proselytization and conversion, the Indian state has accepted that:

1.	There are some True gods and some False  gods.
2.	It is possible and necessary and understandable that people can be “saved” from eternal damnation for worshiping false gods. 
3.	Hindu traditions can compete financially and theologically in the “marketplace of damned souls” on a level footing with Islam and Christianity.
  
None of the above statements holds up to  **neutral scientific scrutiny** . Do humans have souls? Can souls be damned? Are there True and False gods? Do Islam and Christianity contain some timeless truth? 

Within the framework of Hindu “theology”, the notions that there are false gods and that you can be punished for worshiping such goads do not make sense.

However, all of the above statements make sense within the framework of Christian theology. 

Faced with two completely contradictory theoretical positions (there are some false gods and there are no false gods), the Indian state cannot be neutral. It either allows conversion (as it has done for the past 60yrs) and accepts the semitic notion of false gods, heathens etc or it bans conversion and gives undue advantage to pagan traditions. 

Faced with two very different kinds of religions, the Indian state cannot afford to be equidistant or show equal respect.

",He-Hell," Faced with two completely contradictory theoretical positions (there are some false gods and there are no false gods), the Indian state cannot be neutral.

Indian state is a democracy with 85% Hindu population. Christians are only 2.5% of population. Do you think Hindu care what Christians believe about their ancient religion? Not. [deleted] What I have done here is a briefly summarized the basic structure of these practices. Of course there are different kinds of Islam in different countries. Indian Islam or Christianity is different from the ones found in Iraq or the Vatican. Balinese Hinduism is different from Bihari Hinduism (especially wrt female nudity).

The forgotten promise of 1949:The RSS wrote a non-political role for itself as part of an undertaking it gave Sardar Patel.

It's their constitution and they can do whatever they want with it. It's not like RSS has changed Indian constitution. If you are part of RSS and don't like their stance get out of it. If you are not part of it then why whine?

About the promise, well we were also promised ""Garibi Hatao"" by a certain Gandhi which hasn't happened. Maun Mohan promised to tackle inflation within 100 days that hasn't happened.
I think those are more important issue than RSS jumping into politics. Come on now, does any of the ministers remember the oath they take ? You know they have lost when they are reduced to appealing to a ""1949 promise"" and the RSS constitution. :-) 

Rant on suckers.. Hey OP.

[non political] rant : want to share road rage,3,3djdu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3djdu9/non_political_rant_want_to_share_road_rage/,16,"Fuck this country 
Today I was driving back to my hospital with some of two of friend 
And there was two bike constantly overtaking me and cutting me on and off I got frustrated and honk and them. 
And now the show start the fucker stops his activa in middle of road and start hitting on my windshield there was a bike also involved with them 
They start calling me names (my car no is from North)  as to talk to them my friend  lowered the window the slapped him and as a consequence he got out and they starting beating him.. 
I panicked and by the time I was out of my car they already pushed him to the footpath my other friend ran toward him... 
I just came out of driver seat and saw it all by the time I just wanted to hit them and start fight but refusing that my reflex was to call police....  Called 100 and spoke to the receiver 
Ass soon as I told them that police is coming they stopped 
But to my irony the gathered crowd starting to be with the culprit... Telling me why you are calling cops and dnt register the case it will damage your career.... Fuck it man 
I dnt why it is always fault of the car driver.. They are just saying forget that.. But I registered the fir 
After that I know by attitude of police they will do least for me..... 
Now after that I  thinking I should have hit them hard but I dnt know if I have dine right thing by just calling police... No was supportive of that.. 
I am literally about to cry should I have kicked them rather calling police.... 
They left as soon as they heard police is coming..  But I cannot face the fact I didn't beat them up.. 
And now the gathered crowd just saying let it go.. 
I know I'll get down voted this was just a rant... 
I feel so helpless.. 
",Tamrajkillbill," Carry around a machete and brandish it when something like this happens.

It is a good way to make others back off. Posted this from phone so bear with the grammatical mistakes..  You did the right thing OP. Call cops, always call cops. Most likely they didnt take an FIR just noted down details as NC. Looks like you probably missed taking down biker's license plate number.

But other than that you did the right thing.  ek baar bhi usko aaraam se chalaane k liye bola? People do listen if you talk politely. Instead you chose to honk and honking is rude. imo, the very thought and the act of hitting/beating somebody is a problem.

[Non-Political] Anyone using Blackberry Z10?,2,23p10e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/23p10e/nonpolitical_anyone_using_blackberry_z10/,7,"How is it? 

Do you like it?

 Is it better compare to phone in its price range?

Thanks",above10k," Office gave me one, was ok.

Don't know how much it costs. What other phone do you have in mind ? I have the keyboard one.  I use it daily along with my iPhone 5, and they both make a very good complimentary pair. The Z10 is my primary communication device (email, texts, calls) and the iPhone lets me get by with entertainment, web browsing, etc.

Z10 is actually quite a capable smartphone and I think you'll be fine with it, especially with its ability to run Android apps. The big selling point, I think, is its price point now. You can find one really cheap from Amazon for unlocked model. BlackBerry 10 is a wholly different operating system, so I suggest you try out the demo model in a store and see how you like it. For me, I find the OS really unique that prioritises productivity first, and the phone has no issues with performance, has a good camera and works like a charm. The killer features for me are its keyboard (the best virtual keyboard in my opinion,) BlackBerry Hub and simply how efficient the OS is in getting things done.

See what features is important for you in a smartphone and cross-check with what the Z10 offers. If you're a get-it-done person, then you'll probably love it. If you want hardcore gaming and entertainment machine, then you won't.",Non-political,2014-04-23 01:35:46

1. there will be No NOrth India. it will further divide into states and  some states will break down to regions or city states.

2. same with south india. 

3. now all these new region/ states will claim independence.

4. where will i settle. where i have always been.

5. my support: my region/ tribe.

I think we should come up with a way to make journalists of India accountable. Any ideas folks? [non-political],83,339yw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/339yw8/i_think_we_should_come_up_with_a_way_to_make/,33,,BarkhaDuttSays," Yes, start a website that categorizes the media by organization, and reports the following:

* Factual errors in stories (so ToI would be at the bottom of the credibility charts here)
* Story coverage percentage (i.e. how much celebrity culture nonsense was covered, v/s real news)
* Undisclosed political affiliations/relationships
* Difficult, but most important - undisclosed *monetary* relationships
* (hat tip u/HighInterest: Read and support with your money serious, long-form magazines like [Caravan](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/) that actually have balanced, well-researched journalism) IMO opinion a movement for #PressNeutrality or shall we say #PressObjectivity is far more important than #NetNeutrality. 

/r/india will you do that ? sue the liars There's this Google Chrome extension called 'Churnalism' which lets you see how much of the article you are reading is blatantly plagiarized from another article. I think apps similar to this can help readers sort through garbage media and good media.

Also, I would suggest reading more articles from magazines like Swarajya or Caravan. Yes, both have their biases, but they're not all out pressitutes to get many pageviews. Their writing and research is usually spot on. Law about reporting factual information.  Journalists are already accountable to the viewership which is directly tied to their monetary incentives.

You have two choices - educate people to not pay them through their viewing OR start your own channel, both of which are not feasible. So some people resorted to the internet. So now, you gotta bring the viewers to the internet tv by making an online crowd-sourced news channel. Hard but doable.

Now, I am a computer scientist and working on cryptocurrencies. I have an idea(in the form of an algorithm so no bakchodi, its a serious idea) which if implemented can 'force' the journalist into accountability by only showing what they actually observe. If they show paid content then they loose money. Sharing this idea would involve explaining many things including cryptocurrencies which I currently don't have the time to. I am working on this idea though. If you understand the 'blockchain' protocol and can answer 'why blockchain is the 8th layer of the OSI model' then post and I shall tell you how we can do it.
 something on these lines

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/ But how does one get all this across the people - These people's Opinions not reporting? Which is the best way of dissemination ? Come on some body give an idea. I, for instance , post on my FB and any other site in FB that has a large audience. WE should show the presstitudes that their pen which spreads falsity is not mightier than the sword of truth.


Edit:  Who is down voting me? The presstitude brigade? Lets launch presstitutes.com. And name the so called journalists, who are really just presstitutes. We will invite the honoralble Gen VK Singh to inaugurate the site.  I've been thinking of this for a very long time - a site with profiles of journalists along with a 'bias meter' This [dude](http://www.mediacrooks.com/) does a reasonable job, although that does not make any of them accountable. newslaundry does this right? I always felt there should be a law which says

- If your sensational new turned out to be false

    - TV, should run a program apologizing for the same (same time at which the original program was run and for the same amount of time)
    - Newspaper should publish in the same space on the same day. If it is a headline, newspaper publishes apology in headline.

  I know - wishful thinking.. sigh.. We should create an Ombudsman consisting of Retd. Judges, IAS officers and other old Journos and create & enforce something similar to these http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=Main_Page
