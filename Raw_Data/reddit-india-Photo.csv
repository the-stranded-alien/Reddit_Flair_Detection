Inside Mysore Palace. [1080*1168] [OC] [Redmi Y2],3904,bznnis,https://i.redd.it/ikg888gfdv331.jpg,122,,toankitprajapati," [Shot a similar pic last month](https://i.imgur.com/Orxr7Q2.jpg) Photography is prohibited inside the Palace. Some high profile kids got into  serious trouble for doing a photoshoot inside. 

If you take pictures, dont post on social media sites. Woah it has some optical illusion going-on on the floor Please post this in r/incredibleindia post it at r/pics DMT palace you mean? ;p Imagine walking down this lane while being high. I went here as a kid, other than the photos as proof I barely remember it. Need to go there once again. We went on a Sunday in December 2018. My companion, who'd been there before, was surprised to see visitors freely photographing the Palace from inside and not being asked to refrain from doing so. So I suppose they've relaxed the rules. I went there on a class trip in 2007 and an artist was repainting the work on the columns. In my broken Hindi I asked if I could help him and he let me. But was unable to get a picture of me painting because of the photography restrictions. afaik clicking pics is prohibited inside that palace. The inside of my sore place looks way......shittier This beauty is unparalleled Hey OP, saw that glass window which looks like nothing is there? On the 1st floor? Where? Beautiful indeed thanks OP Mysore Palace is really beautiful. Great aperture with this phone's camera looking with the picture capability... Nic pic.

Pristine and well maintained legacy ! Nice Palace. i liked it. i love to explore this kind of places. +1 for taking care of the symmetry. Wow this is really beautiful.. love the symmetry Looks like there renovations are finally done. Have to plan a visit soon! 
Beautiful pic OP üëç Looks like an optical illusion üòÖ Omg India is so beautiful Let's see how you make your way outside! great Wow! So Amazing Beautiful. Photography isn't allowed in there mate. 

Delete this post that is so beautiful. Nice pic pal r/trippy r/pics [deleted] /r/ArchitecturePorn It looks awesome WOW.... Wow been there but my pictures are not like this. You should see inside Mysore ass. o: Once upon a time there was great India Mysore üòç All of you complaining about the processing this has gone through. It doesn‚Äôt matter as long as it looks good to the person who shot it. 
Bumping up the exposure and saturation on this gives it life and just look at it as a form of artistic expression. Peace. Great picture buddy üëåüèΩ can‚Äôt believe it was taken on a mobile phone.

Great work üëçüèΩ https://youtu.be/PTqtrGBYpxQ Kinda hate that everyone who took pictures at this spot in Mysore Palace have 'cut-out' the first arch from the frame. Why -_- Wow!! this beauty is awesome. Really our India is incredible. Fantastic pic. OMG! That looks absolutely stunning... Simply amazing!! Put it on /world subreddit. Let the world know! So now a dslr is replaceable by a ‚Çπ8499 phone. How does it smell in there? These designs are cool but they look stolen/inspired from European cathedrals..",Photography,2019-06-12 14:27:17

Since my high school, photography is something that has always interested me and made my eyes sparkle in a unexplainable way. Everytime I scroll through Instagram, there is a cry inside me to try to make it as a photographer.

Moreover, as I'm jobless and the chances of getting an engineering job seems slim I am wondering if it is too late to listen to what has driven me since childhood.

Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications and courses are needed to be competent?
Or is the risk that I'm taking too huge and should I just stick to finding an engineering job?",okchinmayarawat," Slog through and get a proper job first side by side do photography. [Don't Follow Your Passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVEuPmVAb8o) I know some amazing photographers and all of them suggest only one thing, to not take up photography as a career without securing am alternative career path first. The thing with photography is you can become a pro by just being a hobbyist as well, a weekend or two outside and whipping out the camera to take pictures isn't a big deal. Maybe build a portfolio and apply to places first. But do this while you at least have a job. Photography is an expensive hobby. Perhaps consider joining merchant navy and combine your education and passion.

I might come off as rude and cynical but this thought has been bugging me for some time now.",thisisatypo," My colleague, a lookdev artist used to quote:   
""Camera is a mere tool, it's the eyes and brain behind it that matters"".   
    
That dude had a beautiful photo blog, with pictures shot on a 3 megapixel, point and shoot camera.  
    
    
Photography used to be a rich guy's hobby before the digital age. 
We used to shoot carefully to use one single roll for our college assignments.  
Every wasted frame was crime. It depends.

 I personally believe that a lot of beginners just get great equipment and the camera does everything, they're satisfied. They crank up the focal length and blue the background, and suddenly call it great photography.

Crystal clear photographs != good photography. 

A good photography depends highly on the composition of the image, a sort of mood that it evokes. I know that it sounds kinda pretentious, but that's what I believe it is. I used to do casual photography, nothing great, and to date my favourite photograph is one which I clicked on my phone.

That being said, entry DSLRs cost around 25-26k and they're more than enough to get you started with photography. Everyone is a photographer these days. So unless it's a hobby you are committed to, and you know your stuff, don't spend money. You get decent cams everywhere. Also every chutiya these days has a camera around his neck if you walk around. Learn composition and lighting. Then comes the resolution and sharpness.

Most people do not learn composition or lighting. I have a Canon 5D, Mark III, Nikon entry level DSLR, a Canon point and shoot digital camera and an iPhone XR. Guess which one I use for photography nowadays. My phone. I rarely take out the other equipment because my iPhone (or for that matter any smart phone) lets anyone to take great pictures by fine tuning the aperture, exposure and shutter speed and what not. And then you have a myriad apps to do post processing. 

So yeah, once upon a time photography was a rich person‚Äôs hobby but it is anyone hobby today and there are a gazillion places to learn, fine tune the pictures and showcase your photos... so no, photography is anything but a rich person‚Äôs hobby.
P.S. don‚Äôt get me wrong, costly equipment makes a lot of difference but remember, today‚Äôs smart phone can do ten times more than any camera did twenty years ago so the limiting factor is your mind. Not the damn camera. Camera saste me dilwao toh humara bhi angle and perspective mast hai.",Photography,2019-06-05 14:04:03

A picture I clicked at the pillar rocks in Kodaikanal from my recent trip. Very few friends of mine in the north know about this place even though I thought it was famous.

Love the vibrancy of colors in this image. 

Beautiful shot! [Obligatory threat to Kodai](https://youtu.be/nSal-ms0vcI) You tried mushrooms there? I'm convinced one of the mountain rock looks like elephant head.  I now regret not joining my school's tour to Kodaikanal.  Nice click Beautiful.....!!!!! I live in very urban City, so know how it feels when one visits such places..

&#x200B; The camera on this phone is stunning...  Kodai is great place - and part of the reason is that Ooty draws away all the crowd (especially honey-mooning North Indian couples). So I always feel a bit alarmed whenever I see posts about how great the place is.  Can you help me with a problem? I have note 9 and it takes shitties photos during night time.  I have to constantly clean the lens 3 4 times if I want to take any clear picture otherwise there is always blurry image captured. It was so cloudy when I went there that I couldn't see it properly.  :'( Isn't this some sort of 'Pillars' or something?  Smoke spot?  Maybe you should have a look at ""dolphin nose"" in kodaikanal too... How's the weather?

1. Which DSLR Camera to invest in?
2. Photographers who can guide and help me through, I am willing to assist and work under you. (I will be staying in Mumbai in the month of June.)

Ping me if you are experienced and could discuss this with me. 

Hi! I am a 20 year old. I am very interested in Photography and I would like to engage more systematically in it. I am a beginner.
I would like to invest in a good DSLR camera as I don't own one yet. Someone who could guide me on that and also take me through things on beginning in this field. I would like to intern under someone as an assistant so I can get exposed to the on field working and learn practically.


I am passionate about capturing anything evoking an emotion. I believe myself to have an eye for detail and an active observer of everyday little things. I like to document them. 
As of now I have just tried my hand in Phone Photography and uploaded pictures on my Instagram. The photos I click are sometimes personal to what I relate to and often open to interpretation.

Thank you for reading! Please help me out.",gotmylifetogether," Don't know where you are from, sorry, but this field is really, really overbooked.

For me, a single photographer has no future in India, my best advice will be : make a team and join an elder. 

Internship will be more than free when actual photography already charges very low fees.

I know because i tried myself in Bangalore and most of the people do shooting for free to build their portfolio so most of customers expects very low budget with best gear.... so it takes years to refund materials.

Doesn't make sense. 

&#x200B;

Second and last advice : be the best at postproduct (LR and PS) Take this question to [jjmpf](http://www.jjmehta.com/forum/index.php) as well. Too many people interested in Photography especially those in college.

So your best bet is to take some good photographs which you clicked and send it to a potential guide.

Not sure about Delhi, but I've heard of a Eastern photography company that stocks film?

Good luck with your search I bought 35mm rolls from random camera shops in Gautam Nagar, Chandni Shop and some in Gurgaon (Galleria, Vyapar Kendra etc). You might not get a well stocked shop but you will get a couple here and there. Best bet is to ask someone to buy it from abroad and send it to you. You get a better variety of rolls too.

It's really upto you really, how or when you choose to use it. If you do decide to do it, it can be one of those hobbies where it may even takes years to refine the language, depending on the commitment your're willing to put into it. If i may add, it'd be easier if you included the people you intend to use it with, to chip in when you're making the language.

Also, what is the normal price of film rolls? Is buying them in bulk a better option if I'm planning on taking a lot of photos and minimizing cost? And if the analog photography market isn't that great in India, will importing them from outside India be viable?

Thank you very much for your time and effort. Have a good night. ",bigplaya6," It's expensive now. They are charging Rs. 200/- or more for developing the film roll alone. Add another Rs. 150/- for the scanning.  Yes, check the JJ mehta forum. There is a small community of photographers who still shoot analog. Analog photography is viable in India but the costs  would be high, it would also depend on where you live. Most shops have gone digital and stopped processing film in many cities, so if you can't find a shop to process the film then there are ways to do it online.

You can get used film cameras in good condition from ebay. There's a store in Bangalore called film foto store, they also have a website through which they sell film rolls, accessories as well as processing. The film rolls are a bit expensive though.

",sidcool1234," Xiaomi Yi dash cam. Looks good, enough features, decently priced. Got it from Amazon for 5.5k or something. Though you can get it for much cheaper on ALIExpress. Bigger question, do dash cameras actually survive Indian heat on the dash? I use one. Got a $40 Chinese made one that had a very good rating on Amazon  from Amazon-US through a friend visiting here. 

Works perfect. Has a 8GB memory card and stores last 4 hours of video I guess. I leave my car in the hot Sun and the camera seems to work just fine. Has a very wide almost 170 degree viewing angle. The battery backup lasts just for 10 seconds allowing the camera to shut itself down properly when disconnected. I leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter socket. Got a splitter for the lighter socket so I have one more slot for charging my mobile when needed. 

Its good to have the dash cam, especially in India. A very small investment but could save you from a mess. Haven't had to use it but I think they are acceptable as evidence if needed.  I use my old Redmi 2 with the Dailyroads app The Rexing V1

https://www.amazon.com/V1-Dashboard-Recorder-G-Sensor-Recording/dp/B00X528FNE

This. I ordered this on Amazon USA a few months ago. 

It's a reliable dash cam.

Also, slightly unrelated but I believe that the trick to seeing whether a product is reliable via the Amazon review section is to see the one star review percentage. For this it hovers around 8% which is kinda okay. The same being in single digits is always preferable.

Free lancing while working full-time,50,74mij4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/74mij4/free_lancing_while_working_fulltime/,15,"I am currently working in an IT firm full time and looking for free lance work (not in IT industry). Is it legal in India to work as a free lancer while employed full time? or does it depend on the employment clauses of the company I work in?

I have searched online but, I read lot of mixed answers to this question, which got me more confused rather then making my doubt clear. Please help.",Invincible_XI," > or does it depend on the employment clauses of the company I work in?

this. read the papers you signed when you joined your current company. It's standard practice among employers to include a clause that forbids you from moonlighting. So in all likelihood, your company should have that too. Ultimately, it depends on how cool they are with you doing a side business (provided they come to know). 

Almost everyone makes secondary income from equities, real estate, etc. and companies don't bother about that. But whatever you do, make sure you do not use any company resources (including office hours).  Do it in somebody else's name. 

Like an elderly relative or not working sibling.

 As long as your freelance stuff is not connected in any way to your full time job it should be fine. But do check your employment contract, company code of conduct and perhaps get written confirmation from your company's legal team. Just don't tell your employer or get caught. Talk to you manager/HR. As long as there isn't any **Conflict of Interest** situation, you should be allowed to do so. But it all depends on how anal your manager/company decides to be. The company I used to work for, before going full-time freelance, were pretty cool and had no restrictions on me doing a freelance side job, which I did over weekends, holidays or whenever I took leave. 
  
Do note that you will have to file your taxes for this extra income separately. So make sure to talk to a CA before doing so. > does it depend on the employment clauses of the company I work in?

Of course this.

In addition to checking that, there is a simpler logic you could apply. 

Don't focus on the end-product if it competes with your company, **focus on the tools**. If the tools are same, then you might land in trouble.

For e.g. Write Code for Day Job. Make Samosa as free lancer. Quite Safe

Write Code for Day Job. Make Graphic Design as free lancer. Somewhat Safe.

Write Code for Day Job. Writes Games as free lancer. Hmm... Maybe Safe, but someone can always claim you copied some algorithms.

Thank you once again for your awesome skill. Got myself an analog synthesizer - learning about synthesis, programming and sequencing. I really like turning the knobs and pushing the faders up and down. I haven't even got into patching modules yet. 

Looking forward to endless fun on these machines.


 I am not much into portraits, bur rather more of figure drawing. Tried my hand with pencil. Here is a couple of them

Also , a lot of thanks for the zentagle appreciations. I missed a couple of posts last time, but if anybody is interested in it please pm me. [deleted] I loved collecting Stamps. I still have so many of them. I wonder if this hobby is dying.  Balcony gardening counts? I want to learn drawing, doodling. Do you guys see those comics online like XKCD, Commit Strip etc? I want to do something like that. So where and how do I begin? [deleted] Made a website (very little content): [Unfilled Space](https://unfilledspace.neocities.org/)
Its not ready for mobile yet. You will see no ""modern design"" if you open it on a mobile.

Here's a justification/apology for making such a website:
[Unfilled Space / A New Social](https://unfilledspace.neocities.org/p/a_new_social.html)

You can make your own site for free at [Neocities!](https://neocities.org)

-----------------------

**A note on Websites for the absolute beginner**

Websites are basically just documents.

_The real way_

If you have a piece of text you want to turn into a website, you just have to do add some special formatting so that all computers around the world, made by different corporations and running on different software understand it in the same manner. This formatting is not very different from the way you apply formatting to Reddit comments. It is called HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language). So instead of using ** to make a piece of text **bold**, you'll have to write <b>bold</b>, and so on. Granted, writing HTML is boring business and requires great motivation (only) in the beginning. It soon becomes second nature.

I learnt HTML in this [easy tutorial in 3 parts](http://htmldog.com/guides/html/), only the first part is enough to get a working webpage.

_The easy way_

If you do not want to write HTML you can simply write up a page in MS Word and from the File Menu you will be able to save the page as an HTML file. When this file is uploaded to a fixed location (website address, such as one created using [Neocities](https://neocities.org)), people around the world can read it. (Neocities also has an HTML tutorial but I haven't tried it.)

Edit: Added a note on websites From past few weeks I have picked up a hobby of converting used Coffee jars into home decor items. They can be used as a pot for indoor plants or as a pen stand or a flower vase or a desk based decor.
This is my first foray into the world of crafts and my first comment on reddit (I have been a long time lurker). Apologies beforehand for any errors.
[Imgur link](https://imgur.com/gallery/beSvJ) Any photography enthusiasts? 

I have been interested since I was a kid. One time on a trip, my parents gave me the camera to take pictures. When we returned home and got them developed, I realized it was pretty interesting. Subsequently, I handled the camera on all our trips. Since then, I've been trying to better myself. 

I hope one day I could earn enough to retire and pursue photography professionally.

Anyhow, here's my [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/_tejasj/) and @_tejas.j on instagram WOW!!!! Thank you so much /u/mujerdeindia for the mention. It's an honor!

Last week was dedicated to [getting initiated to the medium](http://i.imgur.com/uMCkGKW.jpg). Next week I will focus on sharpening the edges and smoothing the contours. May be, week after that, if I could gather enough courage, I will work on my first desaturated /r/redditgetsdrawn in acrylic to get a grip on values. If everything goes ok, after few more weeks of value portraits, I will move on to colors. I will be more than happy if I could achieve an iota of what [this guy does](https://www.youtube.com/user/LarrivaArt/videos). Can we have a weekly music thread just like this? where we could share music that we found interesting? I'm looking to start painting.

How much would you charge for food Photography?,5,8zd54z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8zd54z/how_much_would_you_charge_for_food_photography/,9,"I wish to know the amount food photographer in India charge if they are working with food platforms like Zomato, Swiggy etc. I want to get a general idea for the same. If anyone can help that would be amazing",baggym," Really depends on who your client is. I've worked with food stylists who charge 60k/day, but this is in tv commercial work. A hospitality group can afford a decent budget, but a small business type independent restaurant will be much more price conscious.

If you are new to food photography, my suggestion to you would be to be upfront and tell them you haven't done this professionally, which is why you will work with them on pricing, so its fair for both parties. Also drop your regular rates in this conversation to anchor a price point, so that you don't get low balled.

You make your mark in this specialization and charge big ticket prices and you will still get booked, but until that day you do what you need to reach that level. Play the long game, money will come.

*Edit: Just saw you wrote zomato, swiggy. Quote high and wait for counter offer. If they accept without a counter, your quote was too low.* I got in touch with a third party company in Chennai that wanted photogs to go around and take pics for Swiggy in Chennai,  They pay was 350 bucks per restaurant and  I had to shoot 3 restaurants a day along with 14 or more pics per restaurant.  That amounted to 1050 bucks a day and that doesn't even cover the cost of a days rental for my camera, so I politely told them to fuck off.",Photography,2018-07-17 01:58:04

THE UGLY SIDE OF WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHY: Camera-toting tourists and unscrupulous professionals in search of the perfect ‚Äòaction shot' are a danger to wildlife and habitats,133,4e9cv5,http://mintonsunday.livemint.com/news/the-ugly-side-of-wildlife-photography/1.0.1386835189.html,34,,new_lenovo,"  as DSLR costs become less more people buys one and open a Photography Page on facebook and like to fill his TL for that gaze this problem seems to rise even more We were in a bus in Bandipur National Park, despite telling everyone not to use flash, this one idiot who was wearing sunglasses, takes out his phone and starts taking pic after pic with flash. The elephant got mad and charged towards the safari bus. We luckily escaped because the driver drove and then the tourist got the full ire of the official and the people. Fucking idiots.  This reminds me of the birds of Bharatpur.

We go on hikes at Karnala, Parsik hill and nearby green areas of Navi Mumbai regularly, however, we have stopped mentioning bird watching places anymore because soon a herd of photographers ""hijacks"" that place (esp Vashi for Flamingo) and leave trash in mangroves. Disgusting, I know but a ""casual"" DSLR can cost around 50,000 to 2L. It's ""affordable"" for many. Heck, even 18-19 year old kids are given DSLRs in my family. [deleted] Step 1: Shoot with a DSLR, apply a black & white layer & add a waterstamp of ""XYZ Photography""     
Step 2: Post it on FB     
Step 3: Whatever anybody tells you or wherever your career is heading, keep on telling yourself that the guy in 3 Idiots was also after Wildlife Photography !! As an avid amateur photographer this irks me the most, when I encounter people who use flash, I try to handle the them by engaging them and saying that ""You won't get good photo with flash on"" most of the time they listen and turn their flash off.  I remember reading once that some cunt was crushing nests and eggs in them after taking photos so others wouldn't get chance to snap a pic. Motherfucker.

Anyway, shit like this is why ban seems like adequate response. civic sense is fucking uncommon. Here's a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5Unq-1VyQU) of a baby elephant being beaten at Dubare in Karnataka so that people can safely take selfies of themselves in front of the mother.

> * The craze for wildlife photography has increased, but unfortunately, there is no understanding of ecology or animal behaviour amongst most photographers.

> * A tourism boom and the quest to explore newer territories, the digital revolution in photography, access to information on the Internet and mobile phone cameras have changed the very ethics of wildlife and natural history photography.

> * One of the most disgraceful chapters in the history of wildlife photography in India is the bird nest photography craze that spread like wild fire in the early 1990s, writes Dattatri.

I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,2210,ciddbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,468,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

If you are someone, who is reading this and you are stuck in a similar situation, feel free to message me for any queries/advice/motivation.",fuckyallmat," More power to you bro. Wish you all the best! [deleted] 25 is still an early age. I've known a lot of people who went to college in their 30s and are doing quite well.

Just make sure you use what you learn and build useful things. Congrats on bouncing back! Also, just remember that majority of Indian engineering institutions are filled with professors who have no idea about the industry. Unless you're lucky, you'll mostly only end up with a useless degree at the end of 4 years. Just keep learning new things on the side and build a few pet projects for your resume. Just my two cents. You are an inspiration bro. Just one thing, don't wait for graduation to start earning money. Learn new things and start doing freelance work. When I was in college, the schedule seemed so hectic that I didn't find any time to do anything apart from study and a little sports. But now in job, I realize I had a lot of free time then and could really do better things than just wasting it on bakar. Do competitive programming, contribute in open source, pick relevant projects, maintain a good github profile and take up online courses on new technologies. You have a unique advantage of maturity that most of your batchmates don't. Perspective changes with age and there's more clarity on what to choose based on how much value it's gonna add. Use that advantage. You know there are millions of people who wish they could redo their college days with the same level of maturity and wisdom that they have now and you my friend are living their dream. So keep the motivation up and make the best out of these four years that you have. That's such an inspiring journey .. imo opinion failures are necessary for success .. those who succeed without failure cannot grasp the true value of achievements Better late than never. I was feeling quite anxious today about my career and I am just 21. Just graduated, dropped CA, picked up CFA. 
Now I've been applying for jobs and so far not much has happened. I was feeling defeated but I guess we only lose when we  stop trying. 
More power to you, to me and everyone who needs. 

You'll land on your feet because you are willing to work and that's what matters at the end of the day. Fellow front-end dev here. Hit me up for any sort of help at any time! Please get scientific paper published by the end of your [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). Contribute to open source projects. These are my suggestion. A good career awaits you. You shall be inspiration for others and me. Let me know If i can help you in any way. Good luck!!! I wish there is someway I can reach out to you and hang out.     

I am also from JU - I started my undergrad in a crappy engineering college at Bangalore. I loved Bangalore, loved Kannada people but hated engineering and the college. I grew up in Jodhpur Park - right next to Jadavpur University. I even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment? I think it was the chem engg dept but I could be wrong. You were probably in first year when I was in PG1.   

I did not face any of the adversities that you do - not even half of them. As I read your post, I realized how privileged a life I have had.    

None the less, dropped out of engineering - joined JU Arts. As much as people hate on JU arts - they are the most liberal people I have seen. There was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to JU arts and encourage them. Mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now!   
 
Anyways, JU arts turned it around for me. I did decently there, went onto get 2 masters and then finally into a PhD which I am hoping to graduate next year. I am 31 now and ironically I code for statistical analysis now. I had dropped out of CSE engineering and the only difference is I like what I do now.   

The moment I read JU, I hoped JU would be the turning point for you - just as it was for me. But we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take.   
 JU is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family.     

Don't let people tell you what to do and how to do it. I have had really stupid people both in JU and mostly outside tell me that I would amount to nothing  - because I dropped out and because of my age. Bro, I started my PhD at 27 - two students I met in my cohort 1. An American African woman aged 41 2. A White gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from American Army. These two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the PhD cohort. PhD cohort's have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go, especially the econometrics paper. While the lady was not that good at maths, she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper. They outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects. I ended up being really good friends with both of them. In fact they are the closest friends I have on campus. So no, age is honestly a number and nothing else - fight the good fight!  


If you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out - please reach out to me! This was actually my last summer break here in the country and I will be in Philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything I can help you with - please reach out! I am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country.   

And again - fight the good fight, I am sure you will do great.   
I leave you with a song that I used to listen to when I got depressed in JU about my career trajectory. The song was an anthem for us dropouts - Pulak da wrote the song. Pulak da was from Philosophy department and died in a road accident. I thought you might like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVmqXFJtN-A It‚Äôs never too late to do anything. Good luck üëç That's some really inspiring material for someone who has done engineering and pursuing first year masters in psychology at the age of 24. Late bloomer but I'll surely gonna have a great career ahead Wise man learns from others' mistakes. So here's a mistake I made that you could learn from. In my graduation, all I did was try and pass exams. I did well in grades, but in terms of learning or knowledge, I didn't have much. So I had to go back to basics after my degree. Don't do this. Please take keen interest in your classes, curriculum, and additional learning. Don't be just a literate, be an educated person. All the best :) More power to you, bro! Sotti khub bhalo lagche eita porey!
I hope you become really big in life. Thank you for inspiring us to work a little harder. It's awesome you chose this for yourself! Never be ashamed to choose education especially when life takes away opportunities  from you unexpectedly. You had the chance to grow and you took it. That's a win in my book.
My father had taken up bsc in physics and chemistry when he was 16 because my grandfather wanted that for him. He had wanted to do b.tech right after his bsc degree but my grandfather passed away unexpectedly. My father was financially burdened at 18 yrs of age to take care of my grandmother and his 4 unmarried sisters.
He could never pursue b.tech again and its his biggest regret in life. 
Don't listen to society and do your own thing. All the best! >Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments

Most of my photographer friends are facing this issue too. They have tried to get endorsed by brands. But only a few succeeded. Tough career path.

Anyways happy for you. This post motivated me to get up and fucking study while I've time. I'm a bit depressed regarding the backlogs in my masters. Hope to get over it soon. Great for you bro. 

I don't think you'll need it but if you want any advice on frontend web-dev, just PM me, been doing it for two years.. Thanks man, your post was really encouraging, as someone who failed in previous master program and trying to go back to another master program, I really needed this. You are doing a good job going back to your bachelor's studies. 

Everyone should remember, not everyone's situation is the same to graduate by 21 and achieve everything in life. 

Life is not a straight line. I started college in 2013 when I was 18 I got Btech IT by 22 I had lost interest in most things was probably depressed and also took the bold decision to drop out of college instead of giving make up exams because of  very low attendance coz I was busy playing dota and other games,drinking,rolling and watching every fucking TV series  now 2 years later beyond the depression and being looked down upon I feel ok the first year after dropping out was he'll coz I didn't have any friends back in hometown and my parents kept telling at me all day to learn my dad's work and look after it.i used to think how fckin shit I was couldnt do Btech , anyone can do Btech these days wtf, slowly I started going outside doing some of my dad's work made friends.im 24 now and life is better I still think about my fucked up life decisions.i dunno if I'll ever go back to get some degree but thanks for the motivation. Question : What you do for living? Small milate jao, large banate jao Thanks for being an inspiration man. For many wonder only few do. 24 year old here... gonna start my masters in Computer Applications or get into Med School.

&#x200B;

I was the guy who had been completely destroyed by depression. I passed my +2 in 2013 and even after 6 years, I was unable to join any college.

&#x200B;

This year, I have come out with flying colours.. so much so that my family is baffled.

&#x200B;

Never Give Up!

&#x200B;

I hope you achieve the dreams you're striving for. thanks bro , i am struggling with CA at the age of 27.
i was confused tensed dont know wt to do but your post was a welcomed perspective to me thank you 
Godspeed to you bro !! People like you are rare who build themselves. You are destined for something big in a unprecedented future. I can't say where you are going to reach, but your spirit is telling me you're going pretty far. Oh wow this is my favorite post. Thanks for sharing it with us. ""Age is just a number, prison is just a room.""



Jk, Good luck bro. I wish u all the best. bhaii jo sahii lagta haii wo kar; bhaad mein jaye duniya Eh. I was 24 with an NLU law degree. I'm a pilot now.
You can do things If you are doing CS, then I would recommend you go down a different path
-  Look at MIT course fundamentals for CS
-  Look at CS jobs and pick up any lang. or field -
- Get the best at it and end up writing a lot of open source projects
- Get hired at small startup and work your way up

Hands on is more critical and you would have had 4 years exp while learning a lot more working. The only way I would suggest you do engineering is if you are looking to follow that with MS and going down research path. If your end goal is to get job and work in IT, this is more than enough. Best of luck bro. Best of luck! Stick in there. Did you consider opting for an open university course, like IGNOU? Good luck.. Congratulations!!!! I am your same age, I dropped out of BDes in the first year in 2012. I did BCom on correspondence and now I'm going to do my Masters! 

When I did start my BDes course, I had at least 3 other people who had done their BTech and then come for BDes. They were 24-25 at the time and it wasn't the least bit weird. they fit right in, we loved their input and ideas. You'll be that person in your college! 

You'll have more worldly experience, more stories to say and hey you can act 20 years old and thatll be okay! (I still act like that sometimes when I say stupid things and jump around like a kid) 

Good luck on your degree! All the best buddy!

I don't know if I can be of any help to you, but just wanted to let you know that I have been a developer for about 5 years now, so if you need any help in knowing about any learning resources, or getting something done, or just general industry trends in the field, I just might know a few things that maybe of use to you.

I'll always be happy to help! Brave move man. best of luck. Myself 22 and having a 2 year gap after ug preparing for competitive exams. Quick! Get some experience and money then begin a IT start up. The only thing I can tell you is that just dont depend on degree, get your CERTIFICATES with proper training.

I don't know much about the current requirements and trends in IT field but as far as I know, go for AWS. That's the beauty of Computer Science.Any body can learn and code!There are no boundaries , no silos , no walls.Kudos to you for dusting off and getting back on your feet.Remember,no one is bothered that you have lost time,it's only you against your past. Check out this roadmap\[1\] what you need to learn to get a good internship but this is no way an exhaustive list but from my experience this good enough to get a decent internship focus more on projects and attend hackathons. 

&#x200B;

\[1\] [https://roadmap.sh/frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) Misread it as Betch degree. Wish you all the best, brother Man you gave me goosebumps and hope. I am currently doing my Btech I don't have any backlogs but my GPA isn't good either, I am too afraid I won't get a job. Bhai lore jao.. Jaa hobe dekha jabe... Enjoy Can people without a degree get a job in web development in India?? If so is there growth for him in that job? I have seen a lot of blogs about getting a job (in developed countries) in computer science field without a degree but how much of it is true in India?? Can someone working or hiring answer this please? Hats off man. I'm sure you will succeed at anything you try if you apply yourself. You have the brilliance and even more importantly the determination not to give up. Best wishes. Good Luck!! Best of luck buddy. It's really good to see that you have taken that step, wish you all the best for your future, but at the same time i feel that if you are planning to take web dev as a career option then there are many certifications out there, for which you have to attempt examinations, going to college for 4 years seems like a huge burden to me apart from that college is expensive as fuck.

However i will also say, you know more than me, I am just a teen here with 0 life exp. but thought this could be a better option MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.... A thought out focused attempt at 25 is far far better then a attempt at 18 which is everything but focused. Apna time apne pace le chalta hain, don't let anyone shame you on that. Good luck Only in India people fucking expect you to start engineering right after school. I think we should all take time and pursue after giving it a thought. I saw this video on Harvard law school where this girl used to do a job and only after proper thinking she decided to pursue law because she loved it. This was uplifting! All the best You are very courageous dude. I wish you success and I hope you didnt completely drop photography. All the best brother. Fuck what they think. Dude cheers! For fighting depression and staring once again. Only strongest can do. Thanks for sharing this and wish you all the best bud! > I really love front end web development at the moment.

I'm a frontend developer. If you need any sort of help, I'll be happy to do it. All the best buddy :) You're amazing. I'm doing my post grad right now. I was already a year older than majority of my classmates in school. And I took a drop last year. The thought of me being a couple of years or maybe even 3 years older than my classmates, was in the back of my mind. &nbsp;

This post is improving my confidence. &nbsp;

I wish you the best OP. All the best OP. This is, of course, is big call in the context of our society. Hope it pays off for you. You know you'll be at an advantage compared to others because of the added maturity in mindset and approach you might take in studying. Wish you the absolute best, bro. Wish u all the best Thank you for this post. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

This was like a slap in the face. The mistakes that you mentioned people make, I've made them all and then some. Whereas you've overcome your situation with determination, I had slipped more into  depression due to my failure. Now I feel old and not ready to start anew. I confess that this post will not fill me with new energy but I will wholeheartedly pray for your success. you will be more mature and will waste less time. and am here 22 think too old to get education dont have any degree only high school pass wanna study something but still dont know what should i study.

Myself 22 and having a 2 year gap after ug preparing for competitive exam. Theres no age to education. Well done bro. Also do share pics or your photography profile if you have it online. Keep it up. Same here. Started my degree at 25 this month itself. Cheers to both of us! I sincerely hope nothing but the best for you ! Hope you have a successful and fulfilling career ahead . All the best bro All the best to you! Don't let this determination in you fade ever! :D Great man Good luck man I'm 40 and I never went to college. It made no difference. You just need to recognise that a degree and education are different things. Don't let the fear of not having a degree be your primary motivator. Good luck and happy hacking :) Hey bro, let me start by saying that you're doing an incredible job completing your graduation. With that said, I'm sorry about your father and I hope he's doing okay now.
I was pursuing Btech in Chemical Automation and Diagnostics, dropped in my third year 2013, was 22, started with B.Com this year, would be 29 when I graduate, so I'd say I'm pretty much in the same boat as yours. I'm still trying to figure out what should I do in regards with my career, but in the meanwhile picked up SQL, now preparing for MTA and JLPT N3, both of which I'll attempt next year.


>Failure at 25

FWIW, you're definitely not a failure, for, I know you'll make it big very soon. All the more power to my man! God speed to you. This post should be posted in r/getmotivated as this is what real motivation is. Brother, here's hoping for a great future! That attitude in our society is such bullshit. When I was in the US, I encountered so many >25 year olds and even 30 and aboves who had enrolled into business school or engineering school just because they couldn't do it earlier or because they just wanted an additional skill in their reportoire.

Absolutely nothing wrong with that.

Kudos to you man and best of luck! My wishes with you brother.


Here is all you need to know about web development.
https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap You gonna be fucking happy in 4 years. [deleted] And here I was being depressed because I couldn't get into IIT ..... Great work man.... Keep it up You did right thing bro.
Let me know if you ever need any career advice on software engg. I wish you the very best... You are an inspiration to human being..
üëçüëç Good luck bro you will do awesome in life keep learning You go! 

Remember it needs a lot of guts to go against the conventions set by society, you will definitely do something big in the future!

May God Bless you! feel you bro!. I'm in the same boat. Passed 12th in 2014,failed in physics theory. Couldn't clear my 12th and neet in later years too cuz instead of study I used to smoke weed later on Charas till LCD+had lots of issues with myself too until 2018,appeared for 12th again from State board. Took admission in tier 3 college for botany(H) at the age of 22. I feel like a shit most of the time,lots of advice went unheard from my side cuz I wanted to do me,tried not to keep regrets. Funny I did ended up taking up bsc course that my dad said I should've taken,wasted my time. So I feel I've failed them and my only option for me to make it up to them is to qualify some government exams, hopefully UPSC,IFoS. But it's scary in comparison to medical lookin' for job prospect in botany cuz I don't know what too look,where to look,all I've ever seen a botany graduate that they end up in teaching jobs and plus given my history and age I might not be able to score some decent job,everyone around me has completed their study doing job while I'm still studying,it sucks. Well I don't know what future holds for me but meanwhile i'm focusing on what's infront of me,slowly building. I'm still learning to believe in myself and trust my abilities. Rest I leave upto universe, dont know where it will but I have gotta put effort into it.

Sorry for any mistakes,i'm not really good at grammar portion of english,I can just make sentences that make sense in my headüò¨  Due to financial conditions, I have to do teaching job after my masters and have to be a private teacher for more than a year until I collected enough money for my B.Ed. Many batchmates of mine have commplised many things now but here I am fighting my own battle. All the best! I needed this kind of motivation badly. All the best for the future üëç this post needs an award!Proud of you brother,it takes courage and i can relate to this as i have been going through a similar phase..All the best! Doing this requires courage. I am glad you shared your story. This is inspiring :) 
ALL THE BEST!!!

My brother is in the same boat as you are. Although he is just 22. He qualified JEE in 2017, but decided that engineering was not his cup of coffee and wanted to study law. He tried those exams as well and got into a decent college, but 2 years down the line he started questioning his decision... He had interest in computer science as well and he used to code sometimes even when he was pursuing law. 

Now when he started to realize that law was not for him, we discussed a lot, pros and cons of this decision and he decided he wants to pursue computer science. So he started college yesterday. Best of luck bro. Fuck the society and go for what you feel is the best for you. I can so relate to the fact that it is expected to do all things in a certain pattern and by a certain age. Hope you succeed and do well! This post is proof that you don't need a degree to be educated. This post made my day. 
Wishing the best for you! 
You‚Äôre awesome! ‚ô•Ô∏è Well, there's a Master's candidate at my University who has a daughter doing her bachelor's Best of luck friend Indian society is full of fucking wankers. Forget about them and pursue what you desire. The only opinions that matter are those of the ones you love. Nobody cares what the society thinks. Kudos for taking the plunge. All the best! Kudos to you my man. Such an inspiring story. 

I too studied chemical engineering, though not at 25. It wasn't for me either and I ended up depressed. Took a year off after bachelors and am gonna study physics now. 

I could learn a thing or two from you. Keep up your spirit and fuck the naysayers. You made my day‚äÇ(‚óâ‚Äø‚óâ)„Å§ Bookmarking this. Best of luck in life bro. Congratulations to you for making such a bold move. To do what you are doing certainly requires courage. You are an inspiration to the young generation that gives up their life over some petty issues. And the society we live in is also kinda judgmental. Having said that, you must be receiving support as well.Now that you are embarking on new journey of your life, wish u all the happiness and luck. You go man.. ain't no shame in pursuing what you want to.. good luck.. I would say you could have done a 3 year BSC or BCA instead of BTech from a tier 3 college. You could have saved some money and a graduate degree one year early. Then again more power to you for doing something what you like. Great attitude man, our society adds unecessary stigmas to everything, just do what you are doing and don't give a fuck about what everyone else has to say. I takes courage to beat the cliche in this Indian society and pursue what you love. May the force be with you. I am happy for you!!! :D Good Luck. All the Best That was perfect, godspeed. I hope you are successful in all your endeavours. You never failed. You just got a break so that the universe could mold you into a better person. And stop comparing apples with oranges. It doesn‚Äôt help. I am glad that you never gave up. ‚ô•Ô∏è >  I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. 

That's not a valid comparison. India education system is all handholding and spoonfeeding. Great going dude. Keep it upüëçüèª Just applied for MBA in correspondence, there is no age to learning, Your doing the correct thing, All the best bro!!! First year is the toughest so focus on clearing them, after that you can apply for internship/ job at local web development firms. 
As your college is tier 3, they won't mind your job as their main concern is fees, they'll let you attend job without problem. 
I am asking you do job is because industry experience is highly appreciated by MNCs and also because tier 3 colleges don't provide the required guidance and are far away from realities of what's going on in the industry. All the very best bro ü§ò All the best brother.  God  bless you on your new path. Chutiya lodo pe dhyan na de, God bless. Good luck. I'm 29, and have backlogs still. Wish I could do something and get a degree soon. 

Keep up the good work bro, more power to you! ‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèΩ Would strongly urge you to learn python and big data. I know you are passionate about front end but to leap to salaries your peers are earning you need to give a chance to technologies which are and will be in demand. Kudos to you for being brave. Thanks for this inspirational post. You have broken the stereotypical lifestyles that most of us lead  and I hope things work our well for you from now on :-) Thank you for sharing this.  Indians need to change this idea of ""this only happens at a normal age"".  Your never too late to start! Good luck! Better late than never, my friend. Sir u are an inspiration for a lot of students out there. I studies subjects in school and college that I had no interest in but had to study cuz i wouldn't be able to find a job with the subjects of my choice. Breaking past the social stigma is a surely a daunting task but not an impossible one. Good luck. Guys if u think the degree matter to do something in life? only positive story i find in this group. i will refer you to big 4 when you graduate. humanity is dying this is inspiration. Well..for all I know if my Jee plan backfires so does my neet  plan..I could still try again GREAT, more courage to you dude. I myself thinking of doing masters in technology, I am past my 30. Never stop learning. Drop me a message if you want to do internship in frontend development. Most of my friends are CTOs and Lead Frontend at various startups, I can get them to give you a solid experience. Good luck on the journey. You sir, is simply the one we want right now.

You are copying something that is much more valuable from the Western culture Brightens my day FULL POWER SCOTTY GET THOSE KLINGONS Thank you for sharing your story, it will surely help me :) Good luck!! you are never too old to learn Dude in all honesty, really proud of you for listening to your heart and taking the proper decision. 25 is young bro! We believe in you my man! Thanks brother for sharing your experiences. My relatives always try to make me feel like a looser when I dropped one year for a better college and try to compare with their son that I used to be one year ahead now I am in the same year as him. :/ Great job brother! All the best to you All the best dude! Hope you‚Äôre successful with your degree and in life, in general! As someone who's pursuing CA and is in a similar position, thank you for making this post. If only my relatives stopped pestering my parents about my age and my parents in turn didn't label me as a loser for years, I would've been a different person today. I've literally stopped going out to family functions or keep in touch with such relatives and friends (sadly, everyone) who's only opinion on you is to compare and be judgemental. Reading your post has inspired me to do what I'm doing without paying heed to what society says. After all one has lost only when one gives up. My friend who's in Europe currently for masters said it's common to have students who are 30+ in masters, even bachelor's and nobody blinks an eye.. so unlike our Indian society. I wish you all the best and I hope we make the best out of our respective situations. Thank you so much for this. I recently changed my major in college to economics so I'll have to stay an extra year to be able to complete my credits and honestly I get made fun of a lot for that because I'll be the only one not graduating on time. It made me so happy to see this. Good luck to you too! 25 is a young age! When I was doing my undergrad, over the course of my 4 years, I‚Äôve come across people in their 50s and 60s attending classes and trying to get a degree!
And yeah, they were really good at their work. Read Btech as Bitch, that's all I am 24, and I have enrolled myself into a BA (Economics) course. I dropped out of [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) Mechanical three years back. Reading this gave me hope. Thank you. Wish you all the best with your career! May you get an awesome job after finishing your course. Good for you, age is just a number. Never too late to keep learning.  Forget what society says. If you don't take charge of your life, other people will. Good luck mate. I'm graduating at age 23. Brother! This post of yours right here, this shined a light through my bleak day!

You ARE A CHAMPION!ONE OF THE BRAVEST!Wisest as well!

That must have been a hell of a plunge to take, and you fucking took it!!
I hope you find what you want to do and what you excel in brother!!! Age is a number bro. People around the world go back to college when they feel like it and when they can financially foot the bill.

You will make a better and more mature engineer You are really an inspiration for many people. Even my mother completed her under graduate degree when my elder sister was in 10th standards. She was struggling every now and then to educate us and now we all are earning, she wants to leave her job and pursue more education!

I messed up my first try at B.tech(Completely my fault. I fucked up big time.) I turned my life around when I was 21, joined a 3rd tier college, completed b.tech Cse this year, got placed in Mindtree. TCS, Wipro did not let me sit on campus drive for my gap years. I had three other offer letters except Mindtree, now looking forward to excel myself more.

All the best to you. It's  good to hear that you're from West Bengal, are you Bengali too? Bring future awaits my friend Good luck Bhalo laglo eta pore! Egiye jao bro Man you just motivated me to prepare for NEET again just as I made up my mind to give up. Our life should not be scheduled according to our age as societal norms force us to do. May you succeed in all your endeavors. ‚úå‚òÆ And I'm a retard who took a drop from 12th last year... I laugh at it now XDD but I think whatever happened... happened for a reason now I'm completing 12th this year and boy the maturity i feel now towards study is unmatchable by a regular 16-17yr old 12th student. Man, I love seeing posts like this on this sub. You are part of the new India which looks beyond judging people for things like going back to school. Good luck! I hope you enjoy what you do and never regret any of it. Just finished my first year of undergrad. Turned 24 during it. Yes, fucking cunties and cuntkles talk, but fuck them man we got this. 

All the power to you dude, good to know there's more of us around :D Just want to say, I started school at 23 after a not so good 18-23. 25 now graduate next fall. Just keep with it. Make friends, have fun. Its ok to have fun but don't be stupid. Indian here in America, I am about to graduate with my bachelors at the age of 25. I definitely understand the pressure of not being graduated especially in the Indian circles. That‚Äôs mostly why I choose not entertain the people who judge me. Those that mind don‚Äôt matter, those that matter don‚Äôt mind üòä Ganbarimasu, senpai! I'm finishing it at 28 üôåüëè Your moto is your username üòÇ, have a great college life bro Best of luck to you man.Depression is one hell of a thing to get through.Stay strong buddy ‚úåÔ∏è You've got photography basics clear, use that to be a developer who writes code with design sense. Example, coding for apps about photo filters...(even courses like image processing from electrical department would help)  Or more generically, even front end designing could be your thing. You don't necessarily need to take it as fresh start. Use your past. More avenues will be visible once you connect these things.

Being a master's dropout, i think I'm able to learn more without college (also saving on money if that's a factor). Yes, job hunt will get difficult... which is why make a coherent story (you got curious about designing while being a photographer and decided to work on that skill.)

Still, given that you have a different pace/way, no need to get more societal validation in form of degree. Save that course money and spend it on your own thing. Because you're picking CSE, this particular skill can be easily learnt from internet. 

I'm almost saying- why give more chance to education system that failed to empathize first time? (However much you think it was your fault, it wasn't). The system is still the same. Use your time to do plenty other things in the world. God speed to you....to infinity and beyond! Doing my post graduation at the ripe age of 35, I can totally relate. Feel like a fish out of water. Other than what your studies , get into the open source world. Start understanding programming concepts, try building some stuffs on your own, post them to GitHub. Rinse and repeat. 

For any help related to programming or web development in general you can reach out to the below communities.

/r/programming
/r/learnprogramming I have finished both my gold and silver. Else this would have been my proud gilding. All the best brother. I am a CSE graduate from a tier 3 private college in kolkata and trust me when I say this: the placement scenario here is not at all good, largely due to the quality of faculty and poorly structured WBUT/MAKAUT curriculum, which in turn translates to poor quality students, hence do not rely on college placements. If you're interested in coding and comp sci in general, explore outside the curriculum (be active on hackerrank, spoj, explore ML, Blockchain, contribute to open source projects and so on). Doing so would help you make it to the bar of the top product companies which pay much better and have a lot better work than the mass recruiting companies that hire from these colleges. [deleted] You are actually in quite an envious position. You are much more mature than the other graduates, you know the world out there so I don't think you would be negligent in your studies. I would say go give it your all and all the best! 

P.S - I would suggest you get started on your studies now, it would be really easy to score an awesome job right after graduation of you start now. Pick up competitive programming or anything... Try freelancing, try out everything. That's a great achievement . Wish you more bright days in life . Fuck Indian society [deleted] I'm an engineering dropout, I've missed out three years there, I can totally feel you bro, love and support, you'll be doing great for sure. Keep boosting up I went to college after a 2 year gap after my 12th and had a lot of apprehensions about it so I can only imagine what you‚Äôre going through. But over a period of time I met a lot of people and post an initial period of judgment - which I think was more of me being ashamed of my gap than those who I was meeting for the first time ever - I made some of my best friends who made the 4 years some of the best of my life. Long story short, it‚Äôs gonna be epic! Good luck :)",Photography,2019-07-27 12:55:22

",AutoModerator," I cannot see myself living this corporate lifestyle for the next 30 years. I just recently completed my internship at a bank and I don't want to end up like a mindless drone. I don't want to put on a fake smile and get along with my coworkers as though they mean anything to me. I do not want to keep looking at my watch and pray to God that 5pm comes soon. Nowadays, its not even 5pm, it 9 to 9. I don't want to live on a peanut salary my whole life. How am I going to drive a Mercedes Benz? There has to be an escape from this rat race. I would rather swallow the red pill and see where life takes me rather than living life working for someone else. Apparently, a bus was stolen from Majestic in bangalore today.

How to deal with corrupt misbehaving customs officers at the airport?,24,4fnw6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fnw6k/how_to_deal_with_corrupt_misbehaving_customs/,14,"I am not an indian but I am posting on this sub because I know people in india also have to deal with same type of corruption.  I am currently studying in a foreign country and once per year I get a chance to see my family. Last time when I went back home I had two laptops with me. One of them was my personal laptop and the other one of my university(which I have to return back at the end of my degree). Some people had told me that they are not going to charge you tax if they are used laptops. But when I arrived at the airport they asked me to pay tax on the laptops. They asked me to pay 50 dollar import tax on the 2nd laptop. I told them that they were not new laptops but used ones. While I was talking to one of the officers another guy came from behind and started shouting at me. ""WHAT IS THIS ? OPEN YOUR SUITCASE. WHAT IS THAT ? WE KNOW YOU HAVE TWO MOBILES ALSO..."" . I realized later that they were only trying to pressure me into bribing them. Of course, I did not bribe them but I ended up paying 50 dollars on something I did not even own. Keep in mind that I am a student and 50 dollars is a lot of money for me. I come from a middle class family and my scholarship pays for my university.

This year I am traveling again. Of course, this time I will not take two laptops with me but I have to take some candies and presents for my family. I wanted to take a lot of presents for my mother but because of this type of behavior I am scared of taking anything. Is there any way to deal with these people without losing your hard earned money ? The presents I am going to take will be around 2000 rupees(which is the limit). Could be a bit more than 2000 rupees. How should I respond if they behave like that again ?",vitaminsboy," I travel in and out of the country a lot but I never had such experience. Heck I have even got a PlayStation for my brother once without charges. The two laptop thing is an actual rule though you can't have two. Don't know about the phone thing I just put my second phone in the check-in baggage. And when you say ""they"" do you mean the customs officials? Thats because they believe every NRI has a tree in their backyard that grows money and we are plucking money from it when we fly back home.  There is no point arguing with govt officials.  Which airport ? Ask them very politely for a photograph and then a video. Tell them if it's legal they needn't be afraid.

Key is to remain calm and polite. If you lose your temper, they try to frame you or harass you.

Follow your dream during weekends as a hobby Engineering Selling your camera and its accessories is the best/fastest way to make money using a camera in India. Start some small bijiness with that money. India ain't a place for artists and non-conventional professions. Blunt truth.  
  
That being said however, I hear some eretail, realestate etc sites hire photographers for cataloging etc. Then there is the urbanclapp gigs. Still my first choice would selling the camera and equipment for money.  this field has exploded and just check 500px or instagram.

there are 1000s of good photographers. good mobile phones has shown that even part time you can click great pics

he has to do lot of good and unique photography and do mundane stuff for first 5 years and then establish himself Today even a monkey with a camera is a photographer.

>* Air safety concerns, owing to candid photography by pilots and cabin crew on board, coaxed the regulator to put out a second round of warning.

>* On January 13, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) reinstated its October 2016 order banning all kinds of photography by flight crew on board an aircraft.

>* The move came five months after HT reported a first-of-its-kind complaint against six Indigo pilots who were caught taking selfies on board.

>* Taking photography during flight is a source of distraction, which may lead to error and resultant reduction in safety, reads the order republished on the DGCA website on Monday.

>* In a recent case one of the pilot was engaged in photography during training flight, which eventually resulted into an accident, added the note issued by joint director general Lalit Gupta.

[R] Advice for a career in photography.,9,613c6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/613c6z/r_advice_for_a_career_in_photography/,3,"I am asking for my brother who just finished his 12th and wants to pursue photography as a career. He does not want to become an engineer. Can you help me with the following:

A good coaching institution which he can go to over the weekend. M-F he will be pursuing some commerce course, cuz some degree in the backup.
I have found [Udaan](http://www.udaan.org.in/weekend_course.html), andheri, mumbai which does that.

What types of jobs do professional photographers get into? Is it true that the field is on a decline with smartphones?

Suggestion for a camera which he can kick start his career with. Budget = 30k

I am not in Mumbai but want to help him pursue what he likes and help me set on a good path.
",FaizalCricket," I am self taught and photograph semi-professionally (still mostly a hobby, but getting paid pretty well now). 

> What types of jobs do professional photographers get into?

Weddings. If he enjoys it, there is a lot of money to be made in India. Prices for an experienced photographer range from 2-8 lakh per wedding (4 events) in Delhi and Mumbai. These aren't even for the top photographers. For someone with my experience, there is more money in Delhi, than London!

There is also even photography (corporate), and then there are regular portraits, headshots, model portfolios etc. These are like the bread and butter in the off season. Maternity and baby photography is taking off in India. Not as highly paid yet, but still around 15-20K for around a 3 hour shoot. This has a lot of potential.

There are other options like real estate and architectural photography. Lower end is not worth it, but if start getting corporate gigs, that's very well paid.

There are so many others, like product and food photography. Each is different and requires a different skill set/way of thinking. I think I am pretty bad with food. 

> Suggestion for a camera which he can kick start his career with. Budget = 30k

How long has he been photographing for? Cheapest DSLR, probably a Nikon D3XXX (whichever number is current), and a 35mm prime lens (can buy used for around 5K). You can even look at a second hand camera, as long as it is in a good condition. In my opinion, you don't get enough for your money by upgrading amongst the low end cameras, so you'd rather get the cheapest and use the spare money for other gear - this helps more than, say, buying a D5XXX. Depending on what he wants to photograph, he will need a flash (look for Yongnuo - and quite okay). 

Good luck!

Delhi-Based Serial Sexual Harassing Photographer Outed by Victims,20,3ss228,http://scroll.in/article/768482/delhi-photo-festival-director-sacked-after-a-flood-of-sexual-harassment-allegations-emerge-online,7,,sleep_of_no_dreaming," The photographer in question is well known in Indian circles as the founder of Emaho Magazine, and is on the board choosing nominees for an award in the field of photography. Given the testimonials he's fairly likely to use the opportunity for more sexual harassment. This unfortunately happens all too frequently in Indian workplaces as evidenced by the Tarun Tejpal affair.
After reading the testimonials do please share the link on facebook and cross post to other subs to spread the word. The victims have a right to have their accusations heard. Link to the original blog:

https://iwasharassedbymanikkatyalblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/i-worked-as-a-graphic-designer-for-emaho-in-2012/ More than 20 women have claimed on a blog that photo editor Manik Katyal harassed them verbally and physically.

---

> * Several young women photographers, in India and abroad, have created a stir in the international photography industry after speaking out against multiple incidents of alleged sexual harassment by a photo editor, who has now been sacked from his position as a co-director of a photo festival in Delhi.While the women have not yet registered police complaints, they have been using social media for the past few days to recount personal experiences of alleged harassment by Manik Katyal, the editor-in-chief of photography magazine Emaho, headquartered in Delhi.

> * Most of the online complainants have worked as junior photographers or interns at the publication, and some of their allegations of sexual harassment date back to 2012 and 2013.While most of the women claim to have experienced verbal harassment online or in person, some have also made allegations of physical abuse and coercion.On November 7, a group of photographers also created a blog titled ""I was harassed by Manik Katyal"", on which at least 20 women have posted personal testimonials in the form of write-ups, comments and screen shots of Facebook chats in which Katyal allegedly behaved in a lewd manner.In response to the flood of allegations on social media, Katyal has now been asked to step down from his role as one of the three directors of Just Another Photo Festival, a photography festival that took place in Delhi in September.

> * But the main trigger that pushed many women to speak out publicly was when Emaho set up a sexual harassment committee, said another male photographer who started the complaints blog along with a few colleagues.Emaho made the announcement on November 4 on its website, stating that it had pioneered the effort of being the first Indian online magazine to constitute an independent committee which is known as Prevention of Sexual harassment and discrimination Committee.Katyal started getting praise from some people in the international photography community for starting this committee, which made many women indignant, said the blog co-founder, who believes social media is a natural platform for young adults to vent their anger and rally around each other across international boundaries.

> * Meanwhile, women who claim to have faced harassment are now exploring the options of filing formal complaints either with the police or the National Commission for Women.The social media and blog campaign against Katyal has, however, already begun to garner responses from sections of the international photography industry.Even as Katyal was asked to step down from Just Another Photo Festival, a Dutch photography publishing house called Schilt Publishing announced that it had heard of some serious and disgusting allegations against a certain photo editor and that it would not ever tolerate the abuse and harassment of women photographers, or photographers of any gender, for that matter.The controversy has also sparked off serious discussions about sexual harassment in the industry and the lack of avenues for those who wish to report it.These are things that one usually gets to hear in whispers at first, said Sohrab Hura, one of only two Indians to be made a member of Magnum Photos, an acclaimed collective of international photographers.

",HeadToToes," I will try to start an extortion racket, get arrested, be in jail. will become the tihar librarian as I have degree in english literature, life set. Nothing. Would have to look for  another job. If you can speak english, you can always earn 20-30k  easily in a call center.  With excel and other  stuff, maybe some  more.  

You need nothing else. No degree no shit.  Just some brains and you can survive easily. One could possibly freelance at elance etc. 

I would probably be living a spartan life off my savings until i find a new job. If nothing works out, leave to hometown and stay with parents while looking for jobs over there.
 I will write a book full of masala about my ex-boss. Contacts.

I am currently working and looking for a change but I am doing it all by myself.

If I am fired from my job there would be a panic within my family and friends, they would find a job for me which is atleast equivalent if not better.  

PS: I am working in IT with ~4 yrs of exp.. things would be diffrent if someone is at some higher position.
  Mother. Nothing. I will live off my savings and try to find another job.

By the way, taking hit jobs as a freelancer has been a long time consideration. I should work on that. I would start building my own websites and marketing them. I working for marketing company, if i was removed from my job, my immediate approach for temporary will be data entry, advocates (typing) I left my job fearing this :), now I am an entrepreneur. but it sucks even more. Blogging would be the thing I would love to do. but as Seth Godin said, ""blogging can do wonderful things, but making money is not one of them"". I would probably go back to home town and live a peaceful life. Photography and graphic designing Doing photography as part time now anyway. > Fluffer in lesbian porn flicks Cut unnecessary expenses

Do some reflection- why did I get fired? What could I have done to make myself unfirable? etc.

Examine my career. Do I need to bump up my skillset? Are they outdated? What was the next step in my career? etc.

Examine the industry/environment. Am in a boom period or Great Depression 2.0? Adjust expectations and if the latter, go back to step 1.

BENGALURU: Two Indian-American scientists fromMassachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) have been conferred with prestigious awards for their path-breaking inventions.



Nashik-born Ramesh Raskar, an imaging scientist and inventor at MIT, has been awarded the $500,000 LemelsonMIT Prize 2016, it was announced at Cambridge in Massach usetts on Tuesday . Dinesh Bharadia, a researcher who grew up inKolhapur, has bagged the Paul Baran Young Scholar Award of the Marconi Society .



Raskar, 46, is the co-invent or of radical imaging solutions, including femto-photography , low-cost eye-care solutions for the developing world, and a camera that allows users to read pages of a book without opening the cover. Femto-photography is an ultra-fast imaging system that can see around corners. We are thrilled to honour Ramesh Ras kar, whose breakthrough research is impacting how we see the world,"" Dorothy Lemelson, chair of the Lemelson Foundation, said in a statement. The technology, currently in development for commercialisation, uses ultrafast imaging to capture light at 1 trillion frames per second, allowing the camera to create slow motion videos of light in motion.



""Ramesh's femto-photography work not only has the potential to transform industries ranging from internal medicine to transportation safety, it is also helping to inspire a new generation of inven tors to tackle the biggest problems of our time,"" Lemelson added.



""Everyone has the po wer to solve problems and through peer-to-peer co-invention and purposeful collaboration, we can solve problems that will impact billions of lives,"" Raskar, who is also associate professor at MIT, said. He plans to use a portion of the Lemelson-MIT prize money to launch a new effort using peer-to-peer invention platforms that offer new approaches for helping young people in multiple countries to co-invent in a collaborative way, the statement read.



Dinesh Bharadia, 28, a doctorate fromStanford Universityand an alumnus of IIT-Kanpur, has been awarded for his contribution to radio waves. ""Bharadia has been chosen for the 2016 Paul Baran Young Scholar Award for his contribution to send and receive radio (wireless) signals, including mobile telephony and data on the same channel (wave),"" Marconi Society said in a statement.



""Bharadia's research disproved a long-held assumption that it is not possible for a radio to recei ve and transmit on the same frequency band because of the resulting interference,"" the statement said. The Marconi young scholar award includes $4,000 (Rs.2,67,870) prize and expenses to attend its annual awards event.



He will receive the award at a ceremony in Mountain View, California, on November 2. Bharadia's technology can be used in India to build relays which can listen to signals from a cellular tower, transmit them instantly and extend the range across the country.

What are photography laws in India for public places?,36,3toad9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3toad9/what_are_photography_laws_in_india_for_public/,27,"I just got into an argument with my friends who were under the impression that it is illegal to take photographs of a person without their permission even in a public place. I was dazed by their belief and their view of morality regarding that. Shortly after they withdrew from the conversation, refusing to talk further and leaving me frustrated.

 I could find only a little information concerning the matter on internet. And I have a lot of questions now. There doesn't seem to be any unified concrete law for photography. If there is one please let me know. 

An important article I found [here](http://blog.sujitshetty.com/2009/04/photographers-rights-in-india.html) has this information
>Passengers are now also permitted to take photographs from inside an aircraft while in flight or landing/take off at civil aerodromes. 

Which reminds me of the [arrest of 3 for taking picture of air hostesses](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hindu-mahasabha-functionary-among-3-arrested-for-taking-pictures-of-air-hostesses-in-indigo-flight/)

Now I am not saying whether it was morally justified to take her photos when she clearly objected, but I am questioning whether it is illegal. So if I go to a public park and take a photo of a woman, does she have the power to put me into jail if I don't delete the photos on her request?

In the aforementioned case, the persons were charged under *IPC Section 354*(assault or criminal force to **woman** with intent to outrage her modesty) and under the *Sexual Harassment of* ***Women*** *at Workplace* (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act. 

This brings me to another question, is taking pictures of a woman without consent an act of sexual harassment? And what would have been the charges if the flight attendant was a man instead of a woman?  

",PracticallyaMan," I don't see why it would be illegal in public. Under which section. 

It is not totally illegal to even record a conversation now on phone, how is taking a image in public place illegal?

As for your flower example, if it went to court i think the image could be analyzed and the law may side with you depending upon how the image comes out. Is the flower the main visual or was it the women. 
But even then unless the women's image was not vulgar it should not matter since its in public.  

This IPC Section about outraging the modesty of Women is a very ridiculous law. It can be brought into anything. It has no proper context, many a mundane situation can end up being labeled under it.  Genuine question. Would love if someone can clear this up ! Some times it entirely depends on the equipment you are carrying. Once I was at Marine Drive in Mumbai, where some wannabe photographers with their expensive DSLRs and tripods were taking some shots, as were others with cell phones and or touristy point and shoot cameras (mine). Down comes a police jeep with and swoops on their equipments, it was more like a scene from an anti-encroachment drive for street vendors. The guys tried to argue but they anyway drove away with their equipment. This all happened in under 2-3 minutes. I dunno what happened after that. But rest of us who were happily clicking were no even bothered by the cops. Now I don't know the legality of this, but surely it depends on the equipment you carry.

And this is not an isolated experience, even at other places carrying a DSLR raises a few eye-brows whereas  a simple point and shoot doesn't.

Yes, but a clarity of laws is needed. I read somewhere (sorry can't provide source. It was a long time ago) that photographing a crowd is legal, but focusing on a single person is not. I don't  know  about other public places , but in railway stations it is illegal to take photographs.  Be in a safe place. Get a high power extra power super power zoom camera. Click photos take videos. Post on internet. Profitt?? i dont understand.. you get nude pics of much much beautiful grills online for free. why take this risk?",Photography,2015-11-21 16:53:40

I was reading a thread a few days ago where I read about a fellow redditor posting from a village, where he runs a business. It was interesting to learn that /r/india's users aren't just city dwellers. 

So I thought, why not start a thread where each week we post pictures based on a particular theme. /u/PiedPiperOfKremlin and I discussed a bit and decided to keep it as candid as possible.

I don't want to keep any strict rules or anything, but please avoid filters, photoshop effects or any touch ups. This isn't a photography contest but just a way for us to visually share our surroundings.

I'll keep today's theme simple. 

""The view from your window or balcony at home""

Hopefully this kicks off and turns into a regular weekly thread.

My question is for all the photographers of r/India - Did all of you start off as a freelancer? And if so, How difficult or easy was it for you to get gigs every month? Any tips for someone who's new to the scene?",nomandus," * Don't do photography for the money. 

* Don't expect to get every single gig your way 

* We have too many f*cking photographers in India at the moment. Lots of competition. 

* Honestly, point #1? Go over it OVER and OVER again. Take photos because you love to. Because you love seeing things in a different way, or capturing the moment. Never do it to get paid. 

* A bit more practical advice : Your first few gigs are not going to be paid, and the later gigs are going to be very miserly. Almost no pay. Expect this to go on until you get REALLY good or you have a lot of contacts. So make a good portfolio the moment you have good images. Not on Facebook. Flickr/500px/Behance. 

* Don't get a DSLR for your first camera. If you're still learning photography, get a point-and-shoot. Then a bridge/prosumer(or get this first if you can afford it). Get a DSLR only when you feel your current camera is limiting you in EVERY way possible.

[Help] Looking for a photography/applied arts degree course in India,0,4b88hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4b88hx/help_looking_for_a_photographyapplied_arts_degree/,3,"Hey /r/india, So I am planning on moving to India and I was thinking of pursuing a photography or applied arts degree. I am making an one year diploma in photography right now with no other diploma after 12th grade. The problem is I can't find much except a few short term courses - is there anything like a BA connected to that subject? North India/Delhi mostly but as I've found s in Kolkata I wouldn't mind trying moving there as well (but that'd be weird - I speak Hindi on the intermediate level and no Bengali). Anyone knows anything more about The Indian Institute of Digital Art and Animation in Kolkata, Osmania University, Hyderabad? Any prospering graduates are known? I was looking through some famous fashion photography names but it looks like they're mostly self taught and I have no clue on what to grasp. Thanks in advance for any response.",xerophine," what about NID? best undegrad/grad college for design. http://www.nid.edu/education/master-design.html there's a photography design course there plus some other courses that might interest you. it's not a BA/BFA degree though.

NIFT has photography courses under communication design i think. it's a super popular college for fashion and i'd definitely recommend it, avoid the bangalore campus though.

IIDAA seems to be a pretty established place, don't know anyone from there though. you might want to dig into your connections and find someone who works in the design/art field in india - that would give you the best inputs. this list includes quite a few good colleges : http://topyaps.com/top-10-photography-colleges-india

i would seriously recommend looking into NID/NIFT(mumbai campus)/shrishti. i'm looking into design for undergrad and these seem to be the best colleges out there. also, language shouldn't be a problem as long as you know hindi. 

what exactly do you want to do? where do you currently live and why would you move to india for a BA course? ",Photography,2016-03-21 00:47:14

I figured since I teach photography in my spare time (and also moonlight as a professional photographer), I could help any photo enthusiasts out with any questions!",mad_toothbrush," Okay. How important is the zone system? Is it simply shifting the exposure and nothing more, or is there a way to manipulate the exposure using zone system such that some parts of the scene are exposed as desired, and some parts of the scene are exposed as they actually appear? Which is better for traveling for say 10-17 days tours? dslr or good point and shoot?

Is it worth spending 50k+ on any dslr?

Why do photographers need such costly cameras when there are dslrs under 50k?

Also please suggest best point and shoot under 20k and best dslr under 50k. [removed] No question right now, I enjoy photography a lot, but not having enough time these days to go on. I have tons of old clicks of mine lying around to be sorted, touched and uploaded. Saving this thread. I am transitioning into a new job and place, and once done, I will get back with the hobby.

How did you achieve the sharpness, and the skin texture? Sharpening my images has always eluded me somehow.  I recently brought a Nikon D5100. Any books/sites where I can learn all the basics? How do I start taking better pictures using a entry level DSLR? I bought one years ago and I still can't click good photos. Most of my photos are dark. To add more, I bought a DSLR so that I can click decent family photos, am not a hobbyist or a like photography.  I have canon EOS1000D with 18-55mm kit lens.

"/r/india , I just realized I ve made a horrible education choice.I will probably be in the obituaries page in a few months.Need.Plan B. Any professional/semi professional photographers here?",2,xt9oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/xt9oy/rindia_i_just_realized_i_ve_made_a_horrible/,21,"Hi all,

I am an engineering student, currently in 2nd year CSE(computer science). I was pathetically poor in maths but had a thing for computers and was technologically gifted from a young age. This lead to me joining diploma in Computer tech. straight after my 10th. I fared well in diploma. Although my marksheet says something else, I enjoyed studying. The obvious choice after diploma was B.E. . My mom teaches herself in one of the best engineering colleges here in Nagpur. She insisted I take up CSE as its the best branch out of all the computer branches. After consulting some other people, all the roads pointed to CSE. I joined classes 4 weeks ago (direct second year from poly). At first things were OK . Then after a few days I realized CSE students wont be taught any PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE APART FROM C!

I know computer pros will think thats the only thing you need to ""learn"" and wherever you get employed, the company will train you about everything. But I am not interested in a job. My dad has a sprawling real estate biz spanning 5 states. But neither do I intend to join him. 

Basically, I cant study theory subjects for 3 years. I just cant no matter what I do. Nor do I want to. But my parents wont allow me to quit on anything. So I cant just cancel my admission.

I am very interested in photography. Been reading on google for the past month but not knowing anyone from this field is making me skeptical  about everything on the net.The most I got from the net was, a photographer is only as good as his camera. I want to know what can I do to gradually start a photography carreer. I need something that I can continue parallel to BE.

Please reddit, I need help. I am so confused right now, I dont even know why I wrote this.

EDIT:
People, I didnt say I dont wanna continue BE. I *cant* quit doing BE. I just want some pointers how I can be more serious with my photography. I was expecting things like, you can start by giving your pics to the news paper or something, not a discussion about why I am whining about my studies. *typically reddit* 

Again, I respect my course, and I dont wanna quit it. Read the TL;DR guyz. I just want photography to help me get through this.


**TL;DR** Confused youth, needs help with a photography career.",dudes_indian," Regarding Photography as a career: You're not the first one to have this idea. SLRs are Rs 28k now. Everyone has access to the internet, and is a professional photographer now. Unfortunately, the only way to earn a living is through Wedding Photography: The only time when Indians spend money on paid photographers. 

Unfortunately everyone who became a professional photographer 2 years back is now a wedding photographer. Also, they are using ""photojournalism style"" of wedding photography which is more expensive than regular uncle-aunty next to stranger shadi couple type of photography, but mostly includes candid photos of stranger-wedding-guests with a cooling filter applied. 

I dont know which sites you landed up from google that said a photographer is as good as his camera, but none of the sites I've ever seen said that. Equipment is not your entry barrier. If you're earning from photography (or have reserves), you can buy/rent equipment. The barrier is a million other photographers undercutting your price because they too bought a DSLR and read up digitalphotography.com 

 You sound like that dude from that Aamir Khan movie. Something about engineering guy wanting to become a junglee jaanwar photographer. Sorry to be blunt, but if you thought that taking up a CSE course will lead you to become a good or great programmer, you didn't do your research well. The only way to you can learn to be a programmer and be a good one at it is to, pick up a language you want to learn, and start reading it on your own time (there are more than enough resources to do this on your own), and develop or contribute to open source software. 

So to be clear your college degree is just a document to get your interviews and nothing else, especially its not a 3 year programming course.

Now coming back to photography, are you confident that you will be able to stick with this your whole life or would it just be like taking up your CSE degree. Losing interest once you find it's allure vanishing. Breaking into photography is going to be harder than getting a engineering degree and it would need a lot more dedication and passion than you have. It is not as easy as picking up a costly DSLR and shooting photos. [Computational Photography](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2010_spring/). You're welcome. Dude? who says you have to learn only C,can you not take up a course from MIT OCW?,you can learn a million things from the Web,and given that you have enough money can you not invest in your own startup or something,and why not combine photography and computers? Are you sure this isn't a passing fancy? First, ensure that photography isn't another thing you're going to regret! Moonlight as an amateur for starters.
If you like it, and are sure this is a fit for you, go for it. 
Short story:My engineering classmate quit in his third year, and went into music production. Everyone was all ""WTF dude??"". He got the last laugh though and is a big name Bollywood music producer today, making a lot more dough than the rest of the engineers and more importantly loving what he does every day! 
 First thing is that although C is not *all* you need to know, but C is the thing you MUST know to be in CSE. Being technically *gifted* is not what the engineering course intends to improve upon in you. Can you give me some examples of your technical *giftedness*? Can you think about the point of failure in a system being used to trade stocks written in C++, with trader interface in ASP.NET and HTML5 pages, sitting on a Linux server, compiled with gcc? Thats what the BE intends to teach you. I know it fails, but it tries.

Either work upon utilizing your being technically gifted or do not cite it as a reason for joining a course which you want to give upon in a month. To me it just appears that you just DO NOT want to study at all. Not bad, but you have to accept it as a fact.

Now, coming to photography, first thing is that a a photographer is **not** as good as his camera. A photographer is as good as his perception and his understanding of exposure triangle *and* his marketing skills. You can go ahead and buy the most expensive DSLR, but you are going to have to spend time learning the correlations between the shutter speed and the aperture in all the various situations. You have to have a lot of patience trying to select just 2 or 3 good pictures from the 4 GB card you filled up last evening. As a professional photographer, you are supposed to have enough equipment ready all the times and spare kits at hand. Your clients are still going to look awkwardly at your pictures till you establish a reputation with them.

Long stroy short, there is no free lunch. Don't know much about photography, but as a CS grad I will say this: Learning new languages looks interesting at first but with time you realize that they are mostly almost the same (except few exceptions like lisp and haskell, and you will probably understand them better with a strong theoretical background). Real insight into programming would involve experience with handling big codebases, understanding the design and implementation in large systems and in working with other people. If programming is what interests you, I would suggest you try to see what kind of projects you can pursue at college, or try your hand at contributing to open source. If your problem is not that you won't get enough programming experience but rather that you can't deal with theory (i.e. you find theory not just boring but actually hard), then ditching the field may make more sense. [deleted] First of all, why photography?  Those are not theory subjects - most of the course has practical subjects like operating systems, databases etc.  

then again how good is your photography? like your initial interest in computers, learning photography also requires lots of theoretical knowledge. 

i will give you a free advice - you were lucky to switch from poly to engg. Get a bachelor's degree - and you can choose to specialize after your undergrad. Unless you are planning a career that peaks at youth (sports, modeling) - getting a bachelors degree is an absolute must to be eligible for a broad range of post-graduate programs.

Now what constitutes commercial shooting of is open to the policeman's interpretation. If he decides that the camera is good enough to be called a commercial camera, you are in trouble. He will simply seize your camera and will slap a sizable fine on you. You can opt the fight the fine in a court id you wish,  but by then your fine day is wasted running from pillar to post in stead of taking some cool photographs.

[SERIOUS] I am stuck with my career and could use some guidance on what to do next. I am genuinely lost.,19,cm92t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cm92t0/serious_i_am_stuck_with_my_career_and_could_use/,8,"This is a long post and I cannot tl;dr it because I need to explain my situation. Sorry about that!

&#x200B;

So I am a 27-year-old who is a graphic designer by profession. I have been in this domain for 4 years and I can say I am alright at it. I am definitely not extremely good, but the last two places I worked, they were genuinely happy with my work. I got into this field in a weird way. I always liked to tinker with digital art, photography, etc. and I got a job as a designer straight out of college. Since then, I have worked in this field because I thought it was my passion and it was the only thing I could do to pay my bills. The more I worked in this field, the more I began to dislike graphic design. Over time, it became more of a chore for me. That's when I realized I am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because I have been in it for a while and I have some sense of design. For example, when I was working with a few brands, I just wanted to get the project over with so I can have some peace of mind. There was a lot of room for improvement but I didn't suggest it because more work for me. In the same train of thought, I am more than happy to be told what to do, and I will do it. Many passionate designers I met are completely against that idea. They want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve, but for me, it's just another deadline that needs to be done with. I also realized, if I have to compete with top designers to get better jobs, I have to improve my skills. Now, I would happily do it if I was genuinely passionate about it, but I know I am not.

&#x200B;

I quit my last job in June and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out. Since, June, I was so happy that I don't have to wake up and do this shitty job. I still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that's when I realized I began hating my hobbies because of this job. I am old now to understand this passion and drive I cannot cultivate in this field for sure. Now I have to look for a job. Realistically, I can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with Amazon (I have already worked with them) or some other corporate where I could get paid a decent amount, etc. but I am feeling I will go back to hating my life and work again. I am okay with a boring 9 to 5 job even if it is some mind-numbing work, as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent. I don't expect the perfect life anyways, but I feel I need to change this.

&#x200B;

Can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect? Should I just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when I am not passionate about it? I feel the only way I can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself, but to do that, I need to genuinely love the work, which I don't. If not, what other options do I have? Some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since I am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has a scope of me to go abroad (which is a long term plan for me). I feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it's not a that sought after field with which I can move abroad.

&#x200B;

If you would suggest I stay in graphic design, are there any schools or courses that can help me? I am a fully self-taught designer so I have never had a proper foundation of design sense and style. I had a helpful mentor in my last job, and he kept telling me don't go for studies in this field, just keep working and you will improve. I learned a lot from him in terms of my work improving and all.  


Other than this, are there any other jobs or fields you would suggest?

&#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",throwaway_gd92," I am a graphic designer too, and I can relate to that thing you said where you started hating designing casually because of your job. I have come to that point that nowadays I am like why put so much thought into this, just get it over with. About your mentor talking about not studying, he is partly right in a sense that you will mostly learn about software and shit more in institutes in India. But I have heard top colleges like NID and all actually helps you improve, but dunno how exactly.

I am also in a very similar boat as you where I would just want to get over with the work that is assigned to me without thinking much and shit. I realized this follow your passion route is pointless when you have no proper passion only. One of my friends who is as passionless as me is working as a UI/UX designer at McKinsey in Chennai. His work is truly pathetic for someone of his experience, but he gets paid some 2 to 3 times more than me, has fixed hours and weekends off. I was thinking of taking that job up because like you, I don't care about passion and all anymore. But right now, I cannot make a move to Chennai so that's out.

Hope you find a solution to this issue. A graphic designer here. My 2nd job now, in one of biggest automobile industries in world.

I get you, I completely get you how you've been bored by your job. But it can be said about any other job.

**Graphic design is tough.**

If you're in ad agency, you're fucked. They pay a lot but your timings will be **almost** 11 hours work excluding travelling. I'm talking about proper ad agency who works for big brands. 

**GO IN FINANCE SECTOR**

Finance companies are in need of good graphic designers. They pay well and don't have a lot of creative demand.

Most of the designs are simple 'we have launched new schemes' with barely 4 bullet points Among the many choices available for a graduate engineer with work experience, It would be wise to avoid confusion and pursue a career in any of the original job forms.

Design, art and the creative aspect. I myself pursue writing as a career and feel the need to learn and explore in order to continue to be relevant in the job market. This is true for most of the Tech jobs. The level of commitment invested in your salaried job is paid off as monetary benefits and will help you lead a routine. 

All jobs in general that ask for 9-5 presence and desk deliverables within a stipulated frame or schedule are sure to cause a burn-out or at least some symptoms such as tiredness, uneasiness. It is of utmost importance that we identify these symptoms and plan break/leaves accordingly.

On continuing to work with the industry, we should first accept the terms and adhere to a disciplined lifestyle. Planning off-work routine and staying committed to a contractual obligations requires intense practice.

For now, practice working on new skills. Try for suitable opportunities and present yourself freely. Discuss openly regarding your requirements and if the job is interesting.. it is going to be good deal! How about trying other fields of design. Maybe interior design or something? Dude, work is work. You do if only for money and status. Didn't mix up passion and work. Just get your work done asap in o that you can do whatever the fuck you're passionate about in the extra hours. OP I would suggest not giving up completely on graphic design because you seem to have a passion for it.

It seems more like you are jaded with the job description and I would suggest looking at pivoting to something graphic design related but which lines up with your interests/workflow better.

Maybe you could try web design? Learn basic HTML and try out UI/UX development? These are skills you can learn to a competent level just from resources available freely on the internet. 

Courses in graphic design in India are mostly only learning different software/tools to use etc, and I doubt you'll find a course that would actually teach basic design concepts well unless you get into NID for example.

Try and figure out what kind of content you enjoy making and focus on it. 

And as always, make sure you have a regularly updated portfolio of your work ready for show if people ever ask for it. A personal website is a great way to do this. (And if you like the web design idea, you could set a personal portfolio website as your first learning project)",Photography,2019-08-05 18:04:39

Anyone else into Film Photography? Or planning to start? ,16,i09qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/i09qb/anyone_else_into_film_photography_or_planning_to/,52,"Since everyone with a digital camera is now a photographer, to be a true hipster you have to be different and shoot retro-looking, dark-cornered, color-faded photos with applications like Hipstamatic and such. 

However, you can take your hipsterishness to new levels and start shooting real film and develop it yourself. The equipment is cheap, film is not. There's plenty of places you can get the film developed/scanned, and if you plan to develop it yourself, you can still get chemicals (although the choice is getting more and more limited). 

Black and White photography is more fun. The results are different from your average digi shots (even with your digicam's Black and White setting) and it's easy to develop at home. And the photos look great.. More dramatic. 

Color film (Negatives) will still get you better shots than your point and shoot, but since you're not instant feedback you never know if you got the shot or not (This holds a certain appeal to people - The waiting part). 

Then you have Color Slide Film which is tougher to shoot than film (harder to get exposure right), but the colors and sharpness is insane and you get to see the photos right there on the strip (Negatives are, well, negatives). 

[Here are some black and white photos I shot](http://flyyoufools.imgur.com/bw_photos)

[And these are some shot on Velvia Color Slide film](http://flyyoufools.imgur.com/color_slides)

Fun Activity: Dig out the old film camera in your house, buy some Kodak Gold film (Rs100) and shoot around. Punch yourself everytime you look at the camera's back after taking a shot. 


**If you have any questions or plan to start shooting/developing film, I can help. Ask away.**

3 years ago when i was in college, a friend of mine who was in Photography course had to travel to Jammu kashmir for photography. bad luck for him there was rioting going on and he couldnt contact back home since the army blocked all the communications. and had to find a landline to contact us and book a train ticket. 

The riot was because two kids got shot by the indian army as he told us. They where playing cricket and the ball got into military ground. and the kids got shot. Granted it was a restricted area but to shoot kids is not we do.

and even more shocking to me was this wasnt reported. I surfed through out the channels to see none of this was ever reported. But we see Everytime the kashmiri people do bad things in news, like the media wants us to see only that side.

B.Tech. student with absolutely no idea what to do next...Need advice..,13,ceoc6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ceoc6n/btech_student_with_absolutely_no_idea_what_to_do/,9,"I am a 4th year [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). computer science student from Kerala. I study in a well reputed college and have been scoring good marks ( 84% as of now, 8.4 CGPA) throughout my course although my scores seems to be dropping semester after semester.

I went for engineering coaching and got really interested to take it mainly because I wasn't exposed to any other streams other than engineering and medicine. So I took Computer Science as my degree because I had a faint interest in it and it had a lot of job opportunities. 

But since my second year I started hating computer science, every aspect of it. I know many like it but it's just a no-go for me. I tried many fields like Block chain, Web Designing (had a little interest, the coding part ruined it), Machine learning, IoT, etc. but nothing sparks any interest in me. Now, just hearing the fact that I have to do the project and seminar for next year just brings me pain.

Now I have no idea what to do. There are campus placements in my college the coming year and I don't think I can pass them in the case of interviews or logical questioning as I am really bad at coding and most theory parts. And even if I pass, I don't think I will be interested in the work too.

I have a lot of interest in studying architecture and anything that ignites the creative spark in me(which Computer science doesn't). I am interested a lot in Photography (I take good photos too) and Graphic Design as well. But the career scope in these are very small compared to computer science. Also I have no idea how to develop these skills to a career/professional level one without committing to them, which in turn waste my time on studies and computer science.

What should I do?  Do I continue with computer science till I get an interest in it (which I don't think I will) or should I change my whole career to something else that I am interested in??

EDIT: I know changing careers would be a huge task and risk for me so I am trying my best to find a suitable field for me in computer science itself. Changing careers is like my last resort and I wouldn't do it unless I really want to.
 Also is there any other subreddits I should post this to? For better response?",jkpz_98," HMI is a field which has a creative side to it, where knowledge of computer science does help, albeit not a lot. 

You should at least get _some_ job and use your spare time to find what interests you, rather than be unemployed. Continue atleast a year into your course related career or else you'd lose this career path forever. I know so many people who took up sales after doing cse engg and most of them regret atleast not trying to get into a technical field as it closed a door for them forever. Getting into a technical profile is hard as it is. Don't fuck around with your future. If you don't care what your profile looks like, do whatever you want. > Architecture and anything that ignites the creative spark in me(which Computer science doesn't). I am interested a lot in Photography (I take good photos too) and Graphic Design as well.

Try looking into computational photography, computer graphics and creative coding. You sure it's not a case of grass is greener on the other side? 

New avenues will bring newer unpredictable problems, what're you going to do then?

I think you should figure out the reason of your sudden drop in interest. Maybe you're prone to self sabotaging, people have personality quirks like that. 

Maybe you're afraid of failure and dropping something than falling at it and running after newer shinier object is your thing. 

Or it can be something else, a complex pattern which is a product of your upbringing or environment.

You need to think about these aspects, that maybe your brain is tricking you. Every job is difficult and boring in it's own original way. [deleted] I have a lot of interest in studying architecture and anything that ignites the creative spark in me

As someone  who just completed architecture, let me tell you its not nearly creative as you might think...Architecture looks fancy from the outside considering all the skyscrapers and cool looking buildings coming up around the world but Architecture is repetitive and boring and creativity is a very small part of it.

Legendary phone [deleted] How much are you looking to spend? >Should I go for a flagship ?

If camera, haptic feedback, processor is important for you. Go for it.

My suggestion would be to go with previous gen flagship ie with snap 845 processors.

1) Lg G7- Last month bought LG G7 for my dad at 20K after exchange +bank discounts+sale. Great phone, weak battery. For camera and audio, this would be the best phone. Full manual control over photo+video. Quad dac, boombox speaker. 

The LG v40 has a bigger battery and same features but is priced quite high right now. If you can wait, go with this. 

2) Asus zenfone 5Z- Last week it was available for 22K. 

3) One plus 7

If your budget is around 20-30K go with these rather than Midrange like Samsung A50, A70. Have a look at Motorola One Power (12k) and Motorola One Vision (20k). 

They've Stock Android so you'll love its UI and no ads like some Chinese brands. It'll receive security and android updates for 3 years. I've used Moto G1 & G5s plus and I've pretty satisfying experience with both. G1 lasted for 4.5 years and still no issue with G5s plus after 2 years. I've dropped my G5s plus 20-30 times from the height of 3-4 feet but screen is still good! What's your reason for switching from RN3? If it's software I suggest putting on a custom ROM (clean flash). I use the RN3 as well and have been able to keep it snappy till date flashing ROMs and kernels to maintain temps and battery life.
I'd vote for the K20 I see camera performance I recommend Pixel. [deleted] Redmi K20 launches on 15th july i think this one will cater your requirements Why can‚Äôt you just buy an iPhone SE? It‚Äôs available for as low as ‚Çπ15k!",Photography,2019-07-08 00:21:11

I got a camera and started learning photography and still learning and one thing that interested me from a very long time is Flying/driving/riding. I always love to drive/ride. Now I am thinking to learn how to fly but I thought it was impossible because you need physics and math ( I am a commerce Student) as an entry requirement. Recently I was looking for flying club for hobby flying and I cam across Bombay Flying Club. They have multiple courses.

 PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL)

 COMMERCIAL PILOT LICENCE (CPL)  
 [https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot\_training.html](https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot_training.html) 

  
For the 1st two there is no Physics or Math requirement for learning how to fly but for Commercial Lience you need   Physics and Math‚Äôs.   


So what I was wondering If I complete  PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL) or they also havbe Single Engine Flying Training will I be able for Commercial Pilot Licence like will I be able to join airline industry as pilot.

Instead of expecting people to go through the archives, you could add links to relevant individual posts.

I'm stuck with my career and could use some guidance. I am genuinely lost.,6,cm8zqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cm8zqf/im_stuck_with_my_career_and_could_use_some/,1,"This is a long post and I cannot tl;dr it because I need to explain my situation. Sorry about that!

So I am a 27-year-old who is a graphic designer by profession. I have been in this domain for 4 years and I can say I am alright at it. I am definitely not extremely good, but the last two places I worked, they were genuinely happy with my work. I got into this field in a weird way. I always liked to tinker with digital art, photography, etc. and I got a job as a designer straight out of college. Since then, I have worked in this field because I thought it was my passion and it was the only thing I could do to pay my bills. The more I worked in this field, the more I began to dislike graphic design. Over time, it became more of a chore for me. That's when I realized I am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because I have been in it for a while and I have some sense of design. For example, when I was working with a few brands, I just wanted to get the project over with so I can have some peace of mind. There was a lot of room for improvement but I didn't suggest it because more work for me. In the same train of thought, I am more than happy to be told what to do, and I will do it. Many passionate designers I met are completely against that idea. They want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve, but for me, it's just another deadline that needs to be done with. I also realized, if I have to compete with top designers to get better jobs, I have to improve my skills. Now, I would happily do it if I was genuinely passionate about it, but I know I am not.

I quit my last job in June and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out. Since, June, I was so happy that I don't have to wake up and do this shitty job. I still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that's when I realized I began hating my hobbies because of this job. I am old now to understand this passion and drive I cannot cultivate in this field for sure. Now I have to look for a job. Realistically, I can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with Amazon (I have already worked with them) or some other corporate where I could get paid a decent amount for some donkey job where I don't have to think much, etc. but I am feeling I will go back to hating my life and work again. I am okay with a boring 9 to 5 job even if it is some mind-numbing work, as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent. I don't expect the perfect life anyways, but I feel I need to change this.

Can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect? Should I just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when I am not passionate about it? I feel the only way I can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself, but to do that, I need to genuinely love the work, which I don't. If not, what other options do I have? Some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since I am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has a scope of me to go abroad (which is a long term plan for me). I feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it's not a that sought after field with which I can move abroad.

If you would suggest I stay in graphic design, are there any schools or courses that can help me? I am a fully self-taught designer so I have never had a proper foundation of design sense and style. I had a helpful mentor in my last job, and he kept telling me don't go for studies in this field, just keep working and you will improve. I learned a lot from him in terms of my work improving and all.

Other than this, are there any other jobs or fields you would suggest?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",throwaway_xx92, I see there's no reply here. Please try posting on r/indian_academia or just go through posts about career guidance by searching the whole sub reddit. Good luck OP,Photography,2019-08-05 17:54:18
Why do people spend years preparing for civil service exams?,77,bh942l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bh942l/why_do_people_spend_years_preparing_for_civil/,75,"A few months back I visited my friend who was preparing for civil service exams. The guy was preparing for the fourth consecutive year and I feel even this year he couldn't clear it so probably he would prepare again. It has been four years since we graduated from college and it is extremely difficult for me to understand how people can trade the prime years of there life for just preparing for an exam.

There is one thing called passion. I understand someone who is very passionate about say Programming, Photography, Acting etc and spends years trying to build a product, improve his photography or get a good acting role respectively. It is because these people probably are doing what they like and there is no better way of spending your 20s in my opinion. 

But preparing for civil services for such a long amount of time seems like a complete waste of time to me. People don't know what it is like to be an IAS/IPS/IES etc. They are spending so many years in their youth cramming for an exam without even knowing what it is like to be one of those things. And during this time most people have absolutely no life. I asked my friend about his daily routine and what he does on weekends etc and I was surprised how he could spend these years like that which were devoid of much human interaction, adventure, traveling, making money or doing anything that you would have good memories about down the line.

By the way, I am not questioning civil services or people preparing for that. There is nothing wrong with that. I am just asking why people continue doing it for so long when they fail the first one or two times when they don't even know if they'd like the actual job or not. I feel it is an utter waste of time even if you become an IAS after say your sixth attempt by which time you'd have spent six most prime years of your life doing absolutely nothing.",ripple_guy," 1. It's not that easy for most people to accept failure and move on. The more years you have put in, there is more of sunk cost fallacy at work. If you accept you can't cut it anymore, it's like accepting your last 4-5 yrs were a waste. Disclosing it to parents and relatives is tougher.

2. As the years go down the drain, it becomes more difficult to do something else. Jobs aren't readily available, you can't do masters, can't really expect to do an MBA from a top 20 college unless you have stellar acads and manage a 99.8+ percentile.
Your only true options are SSC or Bank exams, which are a massive step down and difficult for most to accept.

3. And the biggest of them all, laziness. Both of the above points can be overcome if you're honest to yourself and are willing to move out of your comfort zones, but the laziness inside most prevents them from doing that. 1. For fair curvy chick in marriage

2. Bribes Surely there's something wrong with that 1) Despite considerable improvement in private sector jobs, government jobs are very coveted and civil services are the crown jewel of government jobs

2) Guaranteed dowry and high leverage in marriage

3) Unparalleled perks by GOI, influence and status in society

4)  $$$ Its all about power and influence. Ab kahe toh kya kahe.. having been in this cycle for few years and missing out on final list couple of times I can only say that it's a chakravuyh I can't escape .. This is the point of view of someone who gave up after a year and a half of preparing for these exams. You can decide for yourself whether this is relevant or not.

Fortunately, I hadn't just dropped everything and joined a full-time class. Instead, I was using pretty much all my waking hours outside of work to familiarise myself with all of the standard exam-prep textbooks.

**Why I started**

- I definitely had some grandiose vision of being respected by everyone I knew if I could just crack this exam
- I thought that all my money woes would be gone forever
- I was actually looking forward to a life of moving from one town to another every few years -- even better if I could make it to the foreign service!
- I rationalised the insane amount of time I spent on studies by reasoning that it was all useful knowledge at the end of the day, irrespective of whether I made it or not
- Reading some of the books heightened my sense of duty to the nation. I had never been very patriotic before this but I felt that if I passed the exam, I could contribute to improving the state of affairs in a significant way

**Why I stopped**

- When I told one of my managers that I was planning on quitting in order to take up preparation full-time, he took me aside for a serious talk and explained how I was jumping the gun. He talked about his trips to other countries, about his own plans to settle abroad, and asked me to wait till I had seen a bit of the world. He told me to take a few more months and consider all of the options available to me before making a permanent change. Granted he might have been acting on behalf of the company to keep me from quitting at a crucial juncture, but I'm grateful to him nonetheless

- Around this time, I also started reading about former candidates who'd joined the service hoping to make an impact, only to find themselves at the mercy of an incompetent turd of a minister.

- Two very good friends of mine had started preparing full-time, and I saw first-hand their withdrawal from social life and it made me realise that this was not how I wanted to spend my 20s. I had struggled so much to get a well-paying job and to just give it all up to go back to the life of a student seemed like the wrong move. One of them has now joined the CRPF, and the other was still trying to crack IAS mains after 3 attempts.

**How I feel about it now**

I'm definitely glad that I gave up before it was too late. At the time it felt like I was a coward to give up on some grand dream of mine, but I'm convinced that I've had a lot more fun in my 20s than I would have if I'd have spent all that time studying.

That being said, I do admire the determination of everyone who studies for this exam. Especially the ones for whom this might be the only shot at a good life. 1. To get married to someone who has government job.
2. They think they will get more respect as government servant than any other job.
3. To ""secure"" the future. I believe it has got to do with confidence and fear. 

Suppose you've written the exam once, the next time you're going at it you will get into a mindset where you believe you know the whole pattern what to study, what not to study and everything. 

Adding on to some other comments, people really have nothing else to do ie no where to go. Working for jobs that pay you 10k per month or less is demeaning to the degree you pursued no matter how employable you are or not. 

And most importantly the fruit. Civil services put you into a premier class, all that power and money are enticing and to someone who doesn't have neither it sounds like the best way forward. 

When I wanted to prepare for civils I got a few opinions, that strongly stuck with me:

1. You should have a point of no return. My dad clearly told me that there's no point in attempting is 4-5 times, you will continue screwing up because you have so many attempts on hand. And as you said wasting prime years being an improtant aspect, how will you justify to your employer or Institute after those years? 

2. It takes some intelligence, no matter how hard you study and plan your efforts out only the smart people will get in. It's the truth tbh, it's not for everyone. You can't pick up some random person and get them to crack it, they need to display some sort of intelligence. 

3. Corruption, point being you spend so much time after this exam only to end up under political bosses who will toy with you if necessary. I do not want to sound ominous but you as a person need to make an informed choice, it's not a simple one. Man, I know. 

I have close relatives (""IITans"") who quit plush jobs to prepare for Civil services, and regret it now.

A friend of mine quit his job and tried for like 4 yrs and finally joined a company. I think he earns like half of what I do now. Sukhi, a famous singer from Bollywood has sung a glorious song which encompasses the life of civil services aspirants.
....


Song is called ""nasha hi nasha hai"" Because the day you actually get it, your material problems go away forever. 

Same reason why people work hard at anything - sports, entrepreneurship, etc.

Some do it for passion. But plenty also do it because success means no material problems ever again. I have a friend who has been doing it since 2014. He quit job at Software MNC after 6 months. He told me that, he wants to do it for **""Power, facility, and he will be able to make impression on everyone.""**

One thing I understood from these people, that they are crazy. They have harden belief, that this is the only way to succeed in Life. I tried to talk him down, that he should also develop some skills parallel to preparing for the exams. But it was like reading book in front of Buffalo. I also think it's waste of precious human years. Specially those from STEM discipline, putting 5-8 years. Hack they would have finished, Phd, started startup, new invention so many possibilities. But I guess it's easier to memories everything  about Indian subcontinent, than using your creativity to do something new. You could say this is also the result of our education system, which promotes competitive exams and whataboutism.

Edit: word Bribes se crorepati banne ka dream ke karan.
Ghar ka kharcha sarkar uthaye issiliye. Who are you to judge other people's lives? Here we are arguing on Reddit. I am sure there are people out there who would look at things you are doing and say ""Wow this guy is making posts on Reddit. What a loser he has no life!"" Get the idea? It is all perspective. Give the person your advice, but if its his goal don't be another hindrance... Maybe they have passion too ? That's why they don't give up even after 4-5 tries Probably its a passion that you can't understand. Athletes train years for a single moment glory, after repeated attempts (not a well example, still).

Also, once you start preparing you get highly invested into it. The knowledge you gain, honestly, makes you crave for more. You genuinely feel like doing something for the nation and having the power to be part of the bureaucracy for good. Speaking from my experience, I still roughly follow the reading habits I gained from my preparation time. And I secretly yearn towards giving it another go.

Now, the ugly side. The scholarship you gain isn't that helpful elsewhere, and its difficult to find a job explaining the gap years. Other job preparations means fresh start over that becomes a  luxury in this lifestyle. The most common formal answer you will get is I want to serve the nation and blah blah. But everyone just want to be the part of the corrupt bureaucratic system and earn money while being protected by that same system. It just a huge organised corrupt system of making money and fooling people in the name of service. tell me about it. Not in the civil services sector, but currently in my third year of postgrad medical entrance exam prep. It's depressing, but there isn't really an option unless I'm willing to shell out tons of dough and settle for a specialty which isn't even my top choice. An insatiable hunger for power and easy money. Kya bolte kya cheez h paisa. Only if they show that much faith to the job Well, this is the last chance for many to shine, to prove themselves.. make their lives meaningful. This is their last chance to differentiate themselves from the masses and the only way to escape the torture of unemployment or underemployment. Many keep appearing year after year because their family supports them monetarily. Without fathers' money, they would be in the streets or doing manual, underpaid jobs. It is just an escape for many. :) Fokat ka rokda and power Most five year droppers don't really get selected. The toppers are always those who give one or two year serious preparation. Once you clear the exam your life and the life of the people close to you completely changes. You stop being an aam aadmi and enter the elite of this country. 

Even after 6th attempt if one clears, he gets to be an IAS/IPS/IFS or any other group A civil servant for the remaining 30 years of his life. Any group A govt servant's life is pretty darn awesome. 1. Because Sharmaji ka beta does it
2. Bribes - you can become a multi-crorepati in 1 year if you get the right job
3. Dowry
4. Bragging rights at house parties

Serving nation blah blah has nothing to do with it. People in their 20s are smart enough to realize that IAS = becoming a crorepati through bribes, and that's the reason most people do it. There might be some idealistic naive people who do it ""for the nation"" but once they crack the exam and get their first bribe all of that goes out the window.",Photography,2019-04-25 22:13:06

does it ever happen to you? I get obsessed about new hobbies for a while and then I stop them,5,bykzgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bykzgg/does_it_ever_happen_to_you_i_get_obsessed_about/,5,"I am noticing a pattern with myself. I feel like I want to try new things, initially I spend lot of time researching, how to start, what all things to buy etc.. once I buy those things, it slowly fades away. I don't even feel like I am interested in those. 

I have wasted a lot of time. But moreover I feel bad about my behaviour. Here are some things I tried in the last year and how I wasted money

1. Bought an expensive guitar. Thought I will learn guitar, so bought Yamaha F310. I spent a month researching which guitar to buy, which sites to follow to learn guitar etc. I didn;t even practise for a week. Now it is gathering dust.

2. Photography. Everyone suggested don't buy an expensive camera. But I thought, photography is the one. Bought an expensive Nikon 7 series DSLR. Played around it for a month. But thats it. Now, I dont even feel like taking photos. 

3. Books. I don't read books at all. So I thought I will start reading and develop this hobby. This interest also peaked when there was a thread on randia in book suggestions. I bought most of the books which were suggested in that thread (close to 20 I think). Till today I haven't moved past first chapter of a book.

4. Drones. They were all craze last year. Bought DJI Spark and never really used it. Sold it off OLX after 6 months, bearing heavy losses. 

5. Online Mooc courses. Signed up, but never completed. Good thing coursera charges monthly basis and you can cancel anytime you want to.

6. Drawing / Doodling. Thought I will try this as a hobby. Bought so many learning material, books, sheets, pencils etc etc. In this list, this prolly is the least expensive one.

7. I guess you get the gist now. So I will just mention things: carpentry, cooking, play station 4 (though sold it off quickly with minimal loss), bicycle, skateboard, gym membership, home gym equipments, arduino electronic kits, trekking materials 

all of these have a same pattern:

1. first I find about or learn about something new on reddit or from some people trying it out. It could be entirely a new thing which I never heard of OR some thing which I never tried earlier.

2. Next I spend insane amount of time researching it. Sometimes this goes over months. (e.g. for camera, drone etc). I try to read online about each and every thing. Product related or user experiences. Sometimes I have even made notes on these things

3. I spend money, get the things which are required. 

4. I try out for couple of days to couple of weeks. Then I completely stop. 

5. Post this period, I don't even feel like thinking about or learning.

5. I feel so guilty of this, I avoid encountering those things. For example, most of the stuff is hidden or kept away in cupboard so that I don't look at them everyday. I avoid whatsapp / telegram related groups, like photography groups etc completely. 

6. Then I find something new to obsess about and the whole thing repeats. 

Does this happen with any of you here?",zandublam," Interested in selling any of those ? It's good that you are trying to find what interests you but clearly none of the things you mentioned could help. Keep on exploring but don't go on the same route of spending a fortune. Start with things that cost minimal so that you don't regret on discontinuing them. You can start running, gardening, start a YouTube channel, dance lessons. Anything which is already available with you or you can take help of YouTube. Do you have OCD by any chance? I have the same kind of short-lived obsession on things. I start reading about things I want and then I read/watch a lot about them to a point where I justify myself that I ‚Äúneed‚Äù it (instead of a ‚Äúwant‚Äù). After buying things and using it for a short period of time, I‚Äôll lose all the interest completely. These entire thing is cyclic. I‚Äôll start over again with a different thing.",Photography,2019-06-09 22:53:04
I'm lost,19,blgfj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/blgfj2/im_lost/,10,"A bit of backstory to understand where I'm at right now. 

I failed 12th last year and lost an opportunity to go to a pretty good university in the Netherlands (I was conditionally accepted)
I'm stuck at home for the past year, a vegetable, gained back the 10kgs I lost.
The thing is that I can't really stick to a single interest. I get bored easily and I'm interested in almost every single out there. I'm primarily into coding both frontend and backend but at the same time I'm into photography, music production, illustration, filmmaking, electronics to an extent where I wanted to build an electric bike. I'm clear that I want to code for a living but all of these other interests of mine randomly distract me to a point where I can't focus on anything. I've failed my retake and my final attempt to pass 12th grade is next week and I'm really not that prepared. 
I'm retaking 3 subjects. Maths, physics and computer science. Subjects I like but due to how misinformed I was I took them at the higher level. (Like maths higher level is basically university level maths). I survived for almost 2 years and broke down during the last few months of my initial boards.

I don't believe any university level education is required for what I want to do. I don't want to work for any company in the IT sector after seeing what my parents have been through and also stuff they do there is not what I'm interested in. I want to be self employed either as a freelancer or a company of my own, and that's something that has resonated with me for a long time.

Am I delusional? I'd love to hear opinions regarding my current state.",nvidiahotdog," \> I don't believe any university level education is required for what I want to do.

What matters is what you do not what you believe. You are clearly saying you are having trouble doing things.

\> The thing is that I can't really stick to a single interest. I get bored  easily and I'm interested in almost every single out there

This has to be fixed. It's dangerous to let it go on. Good news is you are self aware enough, to recognize there is a problem with discipline and focus. 

They aren't complicated problems to solve. Especially at your age. The older you get the trickier it gets for all kinds of reasons. So investing time actively in developing discipline at this stage is critical. 

You need 3 things - the right environment, a feedback process and time. 

Right environment can be easily set up, It involves increasing positive triggers and reducing negative triggers in your surroundings, week by week. 

You need to make two numbered lists. The things that push you/inspire you/motivate you to stay focused, put in one. And all the ways you loose focus or get distracted put in another. As and when you discover new triggers update your lists. 

You need to be crystal clear about the actual Numbers in your immediate environment. Is it 10 distractions vs 2 motivators or 40 vs 5? 

Week to week actively do things that make those numbers change. Increase the positives Reduce the negatives. For example if you notice the internet is wasting your time. Be very clear to yourself, of exactly how many hours. Write that number down and week by week reduce it.

Second thing you need, is a Feedback process to keep you on track. Why do world class athletes need coaches? And the smartest people in the best companies need managers? Because by themselves even they struggle to stay on track. 

So find one or two people who you know will help you or want to help you. Every week hang out with them atleast once, talking about what you have done last week and what you are going to get done by the next week. When you make progress find small ways celebrate with them. And when you are struggling tell them you are. It makes a big difference when you have people involved in the process.  

Third and finally discipline and developing focus takes time. It's like reprogramming your brain to drop bad code. Like any programming, it doesn't happen in one shot. It takes a lot of trial and error. Its exactly like that Batman scene where he is trying again and again to climb out of the pit until he finally does. Whether you flunk next week or not doesn't matter if you understand, its all a process of learning of how to get out of the pit. 

If you have learnt from the mistakes you have made, the next climb is only going to get easier. Honestly man, at 17 or 18, you really can't be clear about what you want to do for the next 50 years. 

Right now, focus on your exams which are next week. Give your best and if it doesn't work out, you can go for November retake and take those subjects at SL level. 

I completed IB diploma last year so I know what it is like. And for your plan about freelancing/opening own company, is 100% doable.  If you decide to go that route, be mentally prepared to do 5-10 hours of ""focused"" 

work EVERYDAY. All the very best OP. Free lancing  is really  good if you can just update your skills Dude, I feel you on a spiritual level. I am going through the same shit rn. I fucked my 12th last year was not eligible for any uni (i am a cbse student). I was preparing for medical entrance examinations and I am not at all interested in medicine. And, my parents sent me to kota and I fucked up again. ALthough.I improved my grades. I just cant figure what i want to do. My parents want to see me settled, doing a govt. job and shit. But I am interested in filmmaking,photography,music,travelling,ecology,I have started learnin python too. And I just love to try new things and be curious about things. I just don't know what I want to do. I really love movies tho and want to become a photographer or afilmmaker. I have to join a [B.SC](https://B.SC) course this year. Let's see what happens :) I am just like you except i am gonna give 12th boards these year. The variety of choices available in this age is something the previous generations never faced(to some extent) . And here i am interested in almost everything.",Photography,2019-05-07 03:23:09
Need help from Bangalore people!,7,br7mp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/br7mp2/need_help_from_bangalore_people/,5,"Hello, Randians from Bangalore. I have moved to Bangalore a week ago and currently staying with a friend in Kormangla. 

I am looking to catch up with film/photography/art enthusiasts. I will be setting up an art-installation soon in one of the malls. The entire installation will be made of used plastic to raise awareness among the people.

I need help of several people to do this. You can volunteer and help me in the following ways:

1. Procurement of Plastic
2. Designs of Installations
3. If you know any places (cafe, restaurant, malls) , help me in getting permissions.
4. If you work in big companies with fairly huge office buildings, please help me if there is a way to display.

Come along, help create some awareness. Even if 10% of people stop using straws or whatever, we could help save ourselves a little bit.",wannaflybillu," /r/Bangalore I have plastic to get rid of, can even drop at your place if it's in Koramangala.

Skill development thread,35,b2kqqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b2kqqh/skill_development_thread/,10,"There have been so many posts recently about ""graduated with engineering degree but can't find a job"". 

Please understand that a degree is no guarantee of a job. Indian academics is notoriously out of touch and what you've studied has most likely been made obsolete. To differentiate yourself from millions of others you must enhance your skills regularly via self learning and practice. An employer doesn't really care about your degree but your ""talent stack"". The more proficient you are at multiple things the higher your chances of being recruited.

Redditors please share what online websites/courses you use and a small review. These can be free or paid. If paid please share the amount. 

If you are interested in learning ask your fellow redditors what you want to learn and they will guide you.

I'll keep updating this post with courses.

Free:
1.	https://EdX.org - free courses on cs, data science, supply chain management to name a few from top global universities. For a fee ($50-$300) you can upgrade and get a certificate too.

2.	Piximperfect on YouTube - learn Photoshop skills (via /u/rishi71)

3.    https://freecodecamp.org has great courses for web development and they keep updating it. (via /u/cellokey)

4.    https://cognitiveclass.ai - courses on data science and AI (via /u/theboywhodaydreams)

There are star ratings for each so you can sort the top rated courses in your chosen field.",Holypatchouli," I'm no expert but I've been doing photoshop/premiere and ableton live for about 5 years now. Just gonna cite some sources 

>Photoshop

For photoshop look for the channel 'Piximperfect' to learn basics such as masking, layers, blending modes etc. Other channel- Photoshop Tutorials

If you're good in photoshop, premiere isn't gonna be tough for you. [Here is a beginner video](https://youtu.be/Hls3Tp7JS8E) 

Also note that there are two versions of premiere : Adobe premiere pro and premiere elements. 

>music production

For music production, choose a DAW and don't change. Stick with it until you get basics right. Most of the stuff you can learn on YouTube itself.
My preference is Ableton Live. But you can go for Audacity(free), Fl Studio, Cubase etc.

Unfortunately both of these things are very costly. DAWs are super expensive.

Edit: Gimp is a free alternative of Photoshop.  If you want to learn about Data Analytics - Machine Learning - AI - all those terms you keep hearing about. Here's a really good track, that's free - all that's needed is time,patience and will to learn.

Reddit India Recap of 2018,211,ab62uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ab62uu/reddit_india_recap_of_2018/,30,"Welcome to the first ever installment of a year in review of this subreddit where we look at some of the best and most influential events and posts of this year. 

2018 has been quite a rollercoaster of a year for this subreddit as well as the country! With one of the highest growth rates ever of this subreddit. We grew from just above 100K subscribers to now more than the 1.6L magic number of subscribers. 

The year saw landmarks Supreme Court judgements in India, most importantly the striking of Section 377 of the IPC criminalizing gay sex. We have had many amazing posts this year which go from the entire subreddit grouping together to help people in Kerala with the largest donation drive ever on this subreddit with verified donations over ‚Çπ7,00,000 to paying college fees of a user who couldn't afford to. 

Here are some highlights in **no particular order** which made up this year of r/india: 

* [The massive Kerala donation drive started](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/981o7s/will_donate_thrice_the_number_of_upvotes_amount/) by /u/TheBeginnerr to match the donations to the upvotes of the thread inspired hundreds of Redditors to donate to the Kerala Disaster Relief Fund.

And the [beautiful image of a son no longer being considered a criminal](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dt64s/if_you_are_not_moved_by_this_picture_i_wish_i_had/) became one of the highest voted posts of this year. 

* Among the many historical posts, r/india particularly loved the pictures of [three women training to be doctors (1885)](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7mczx1/an_indian_woman_a_japanese_woman_and_a_syrian/),  [historical photos of Bhagat Singh posted on the day of his death anniversary](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/86h70i/87_years_ago_today_shaheed_bhagat_singh_was/),  a [smog-free New Delhi from the 1950s](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9wow0r/new_delhi_in_1950s_clean_air_without_smog/), [a French boy introducing himself to Indian soldiers during the First World War](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7x16j8/a_french_boy_introduces_himself_to_indian/) and [Prof. C.V Raman teaching in 1960s](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9d7nxf/1960s_physicist_cvraman_teaching_in_class/).

Thanks to everyone of the awesome users who made and participated in these posts and also to all who participate in the scheduled book/movies/music/etc threads too to keep it going. I know I have to be more regular in posting them. 

Hope 2019 has even better things in store. Cheers. These were certainly the highlights of the year. I think the news about that ambulance in Kerala deserved a mention. I'm talking about the incident where people cleared the way for an ambulance traveling about 300km or so across Kerala. I don't exactly remember the numbers but that was inspiring news. This has been a great year. Thanks for the rewind. Can someone point me to the massive book post made a few days ago? I forgot to save it. Thanks for the mention, u/Devam13. I just saw this post :)

For the people who are interested, I am launching fourth book giveaway tomorrow. Stay tuned! This is great! Can someone do this GK events?  Floods and Vajpayee death are the only events that happened in India?  Oh the Lays magic masala of course!

Cheers!",rahulthewall," Can anyone please explain where does the ‚Çπ1.6 lpm thing come from? It's a really specific number, and there must be a story behind it which I must know. Are we thinking about doing something on the Flipkart, Amazon, Uber etc., disappointment/rant threads? There are many and seeing them as ""if they are the biggest problems India faces now"" (/s) and ranting on it every single day is annoying.

And I love the banner image now! Kudos  [/u/SquawkTalk](https://www.reddit.com/u/SquawkTalk)   The ""/r/india"" text is getting covered: [link](https://i.imgur.com/5RukBO7.png) How about asking users to redirect shitty recycled memes to r/desimemes? ü§î What's ""ft.""? Googling was useless here.. The photography posts are a bit annoying TBH. Covers a lot of room for days. But since they are upvoted repeatedly it seems the community wants that. I can filter it out with flair, I understand. Thank you mods for this decision. You guys found a good solution here.

Also, one more suggestion. Consider formatting of the title of sticky threads. Because they are worded in a certain way, and always on the top I pretty much just end up ignoring the top two posts on /r/india. I don't even register when a new thread goes up there. Not sure if any CSS formatting will help, but maybe someway to distinguish it textually?

Broke up 30! What next???,15,al2pdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/al2pdh/broke_up_30_what_next/,12,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;",ablahnaari," Chill dude, no need to worry. It's better to be alone than with someone with whom you're not comfortable. Living by yourself has its own advantage.  * You have time. 30 is not that old. Get back out there when you are ready.
* Don't blame yourself, or your ex. If you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices, either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise. 
* If it had to end, Its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later.
* Give it some time and re-evaluate, feelings always clouds reality. Everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens. Time heals most wounds if you let it.
* Stay Positive. I am 33 years old, have never been in a relationship, no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons, yet I keep faith while also keeping fit, enjoying my life, finding new interests and try to travel as much as I can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and ""society"". Last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards. Love has no sell by date.
* You mentioned you love to travel, do more of it, its a great distraction. Plan a trip in the near future. Travel has healing and transformative powers.

I wish you all the best!
  The dude lived in the city for 20+ years and wants to go farm? Let him. He seems passionate about it, don‚Äôt hold him back.

As for you, you are too young to be worried about what‚Äôs gonna happen to you. Take it easy and move on; you have no idea what‚Äôs in store. 

That ablanaari shit was funny though üòä >I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head

Stop worrying about that crap and work on making yourself a better person. Pickup some new hobbies. Hang out with your friends or try making new ones. I have to admit that I have not travelled as much as you did.

But my only suggestion right now is to pack your bag and leave your home.
 You will get a  better solution as I am pretty sure you will meet up someone who has solutions to all your problems. 

LPT: Just talk to as many people as possible. find new things to do. the less you sit and ponder, the better it'll be. give it time, and then ponder, and let go.

live life forward, not backwards. You took the right longterm decision. The blaming, bitterness and sadness for a few months is common. Convince and coax your mind that you took a good positive long-term decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned. 

*Express* your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way. For me, writing them in detail in a diary worked. But if you're not into writing, record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself. 

Or if you have a close friend who's a good listener, express it in front of them. I don't know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps, but it does.

As for fear of society, most people don't bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled. Solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite a bit. I'd suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons - such as love and companionship - and never for negative or shallow reasons - such as fear / reputation / social status.  take it from a 24 y/o guy, who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love.

&#x200B;

Smoke a joint, let go off things, and start afresh. 30 ain't too old. You still have a good 4-5 years before you settle down. Goodluck and learn to forgive but not forget :) 30+something, just broke up. Its very normal to hate your ex even if he/she hasnt done anything horrible. 

&#x200B;

Be kind to yourself. Im not a believer in god or spirituality but mindfulness has helped me. What are you going through is grief. Its the same feeling as you would feel if a loved one died. You probably already know the 5 stages of grief. You are going to go through all of it, not in sequence but in circles. Give yourself time and be kind to yourself. 

&#x200B;

Trust me I went through this, Im not out yet .. but I am a million times better than what I was immediately after.  curious question... is the word 'abla' or 'ablah'? i know certain indian demographic ppl like to add 'h' around their 'T's but cmon why here? i am pretty sure the actual word is abla

Need of advice from married people on choosing a life partner,12,ad5bax,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ad5bax/need_of_advice_from_married_people_on_choosing_a/,22,"_TL;DR_ Would you settle and make best out of what you have got or would you take risk and try harder? Not that I will blindly follow one's advice but it will help me to take good decision.

I'm from middle class who is an introvert, well groomed, fit and active. Having varied interests and hobbies keeps me occupied esp., travelling, trekking and photography. Working in a small IT startup I earn enough to live a comfortable life.

My parents have been trying to get me married for the past 3 years. Coming from a small city, my family is moderately conservative. They definitely want a bride in same caste and matching horroscope. Most preferably in same city so that they can know well about bride's family background. We are signed up in matrimonial sites also. The selection process is usually this: my parents check for kundli match and girl's family, out of which I choose one that's looking good, then if both families agree do we have a meeting in a temple. That's when I look for matching personality.

Parents are dissatisfied and already tired of me as I'm picky. They expect me to choose the one just with good family and kundli match. They don't care about personality and the appearance. Met couple of potential bride vis a vis with family in a temple who were good looking but are boring ""family girls"" who doesn't have passion for anything nor did they show interest in what I do. So we didn't proceed.

Recently I met similar one. We talked for 15 mins. It was me talking most of the time. She asked about my job, do I own car, can I cook. I try to understand her from her daily activities. She was like home-to-work, work-to-home in weekdays and may visit malls in the weekends if not visiting hometown. There wasn't much of similarities other than both of us are in software industry. Her realtive was rushing to end this talk and she didn't have anything to talk. Their family and girl instantly showed their interest to proceed. I held my parents, who were also interested, and said we'll go home and reply.

It was difficult for me to decide life partner within few minutes. I want to know many other things including whether she can keep herself healthy and fit in the future, whether she is interested to accompany me for weekend trips, etc. Made my parents to call them and ask for a casual meeting in a public place. They refused and will allow further talks only if I say yes. Pretty conservative and probably they fear I might reject after the talk and it'll be a shame for them.

I'm gonna hit 30 soon. It's considered past marriageable age by many. So, fewer opportunities. Also skewed sex ratio! I'm confused shall I settle for this (like [Bojack says](https://youtu.be/cTAi_3HWKHQ) ) or take risk and look out further. I appreciate your advice.

_EDIT:_ To provide better context, I don't have much of social circle. There are few male friends with whom I hangout occasionally and travel. They also don't have girlfriends. Actually they don't care about it. My introversion wasn't helpful to find a life partner.
I have had couple of relationships in the past whom I met through dating apps. They lasted few months to a year. If it were strong, I would be determined to marry irrespective of parents' approval. But no. Time is ticking more loudly now.",sunrays6," [deleted] [removed] >an introvert, well groomed, fit and active. Having varied interests and hobbies keeps me occupied esp., travelling, trekking and photography. Working in a small IT startup I earn enough to live a comfortable life.

Didn‚Äôt you like any girl in these years? you must have met many, with common interests Not OP, but can anyone with experience tell me if it's necessary to get married?  Sorry but I am finding it a little hard to grasp that you didn't find anyone 'at all' who could remotely match your expectations. Why didn't you have a girlfriend?
Just want to understand the situation Have you had any relationships before at all? While shopping for clothes as a kid, my parents would often tell me at the store, 'das bar pasand aaye to hi lena' (only buy if you're 10/10 sure). 

Do I need to say anymore?

Budget is between 13k to 15k. Did some research (I'm not the smartest when it comes to tech) and decided upon 3 phones - RealMe 2 Pro, Asus Zenfone Maxpro M2 and Mi A2.

Majority of my usage is streaming, texting, photography and social media. My usage is also rough

My requirements are:
1) Good lasting battery
2) Good build quality, durable
3) No lags
4) Good camera

I've read that all 3 phones are going to receive/have received Android Pie updates.

Also, what advantages do Stock Android offer over Color OS and vice versa?

Thank you.",Hardwilly," Of all three you mentioned, I would go with Maxpro M2

1. It has 5000 mah battery. So your first requirement is covered.
2. Build quality is good. I feel realme 2 pro is built better than this
3. As it runs on Stock android with snapdragon 660 SOC, performance should be just fine.
4. Camera as per Geekyranjit is okay for the price.

And coming to color os, people hate custom skins because of the bloatware, delay in software patches and updates etc


If I were you and can wait a bit Longer, I will wait for Redmi note 7 pro wait for redmi note 7 pro  I was in same situation as you .Got myself Nokia 6.1 p. Except the battery everything is great. Build is superb. No lags, . Monthly security updates. Running on Android 9, camera is awesome. Screen is better than all 3 you mentioned",Photography,2019-02-07 20:11:05
Diwali advice for a foreign tourist?,27,9u37ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9u37ph/diwali_advice_for_a_foreign_tourist/,19,"My wife and I are spending the next few days in Jaipur, and have timed our trip so we get to stay here through a bit of Diwali. Can you recommend any great spots to enjoy Diwali?

Note: neither of us are shopping hobbyists, and are both photography fans. ",Redditing2017," Would recommend visiting Albert Hall Museum and Johri bazar on the evening of Diwali. These places have awesome lightings and decorations. Watch out for the crackers. Carry your medicine if you're asthmatic. Otherwise, everything else should be fine.

You can enjoy the hospitality there depending on your stay. People would be lighting lamps, distributing sweets and bursting crackers.

All this is general precaution / advice.

As for spot, I am sure a local or somebody from Jaipur on Reddit would be able to help you out.

Welcome and enjoy the trip. Few blogs you can check out https://www.leialauren.com/blogs/news/jaipur
https://nomadicboys.com/diwali-in-jaipur/

also, [indiamike forums](https://www.indiamike.com/india-search?qry=Diwali+jaipur&utm_source=header-search-bar&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=search&sort=relevance&cnt=all&username=&date=all&city=&state=&category=&customTag=) Amber Palace (try to go for a walk in Amber village), Hawa Mahal, City Palace, Nahargarh Fort, Jaigarh Fort.

Maybe walk around in Jauhari Bazar (try traditional sweets at LMB); also MI Road (check out Special Lassiwala). 

Then, Birla Mandir, Albert Hall Museum (try Masala Chowk nearby which houses branches of famous street food shops under one roof), Galta Mandir (famous for monkeys).

The thing is though, because of Diwali, some of the places might not be possible. Check for each of these places if and when they will be closed for Diwali.

Also, just make sure that you guys are fine with loads and loads of firecrackers. You can go to some of the heritage hotels (Alsisar Haveli, Samod are the ones I know of) by the countryside for a quite night nearby.  [deleted] Don't get robbed amidst the chaos. Wear ear plugs if you want to set off some fireworks, or risk getting tinnitus. Visit the nearest Kacha Dabba High rises enjoy the crackers  beware of falling spent fireworks.

On a related note, I feel there is a lack of DIY culture in India. Nothing wrong with calling professional plumbers and electricians for every small thing but it'd be great if people can pick up basics of at least couple of trades and do it themselves.

I'm trying to gather resources available in India to learn these skills.

music- i'm already musically inclined (i sing and can play 4 instruments), but i wanted to pick up the ukulele (i saw one at a music shop, sat down, and it came pretty naturally to me)- bought a cheap one, learnt to play it in 2 months. now i play fairly efficiently. wins over lots of hearts (ayyeeee).

running- couch to 5k. i had to get into some kind of fitness, running was what i decided to begin with. in 2015, i ran my first half marathon. i had a hiatus for a couple of years, but i'm building my stamina up again.  I am a Veena player. From 2017 November I started Vocal Music. I gave the government exam for it. My examiners actually lauded my Shruthi and melody. All the years I had been thinking I was braying and that my voice was bad.But experts themselves have contrary views . Sad, that I have wasted so many precious years not knowing my worth.

 When I was quite young, I was made to learn Bharathanatyam. Suddenly parents stopped that, because some relative did not want me to learn. 

I learnt Deutch some years back. Think I am good at it. Learnt Kannada on my own during childhood through TV serials that my mom used to watch. And then learnt its script later on using Nokia feature phone. Now, have started to learn Telugu as well through internet. I don't know if learning these languages will ever help in a great way. But, I love south Indian languages. I learned to skateboard . I was living in a gated community (villas) with concreted roads. I went to a Decathlon shop and was pretty much excited to see they sell skateboard. So I thought, why not buy one and learn cause my community was scarcely populated and there was ample space. I tried it on my own , and within 2 weeks, I could do the skating. I am still not good at the skateboard tricks that they show in TV's. :) Can‚Äôt upvote enough!
RemindMe! 30 hours I like cooking.. but I usually cook while thinking of keeping my food as nutritious as possible. Like I'd get creative with what I think I'd find tasty and nutritious. My cooking doesn't involve dishes that are traditionally made Singing: been singing as hobby at home for more than a decade. I sing almost 24/7. I pick new songs(mostly English) and learn them. I never had singing lessons, but I‚Äôm quite good at it.

Cooking: I started cooking after I left college. Experienced enough to cook at home for myself, I‚Äôm particular about balanced diet. sometimes I experiment with new dishes.

Yoga: past 3 yrs, just casually started mimicking yoga poses from Instagram profiles.(I refer to YouTube sometimes). I also follow few physiotherapists on insta, and do some light strength training at home also. Acting: Started off in small roles in college plays. Found out that I was pretty good at it. Started participating in all sorts of competitions soon and got better and better. Ended up heading college drama club, lead roles in almost all college plays for two years, best actor in a fest with many colleges and also did a play with a theater group.

Poker: Was taught during undergrad for the first time. Studied theory obsessively for a week to join the group again on weekend to be better. Have been playing the game for over 8 years now, sometimes regularly and sometimes sporadically. Played both online and offline and have always ended up with positive EV in pretty much every group/website I've played for long in. Photography : I've been photographing since I was 11, it's something I very dearly adore. Also I've been meaning to add a photography section on my portfolio website but been procrastinating a lot, I hate front end work.

Shooting : Although I kinda stopped over the years but I'd mean to pick it up again once I get over with my studies. This was a great way to concentrate and quite a skill to learn. I used to be in Haryana team for U-17 shooting nationals but as the amount of studies increased I couldn't keep up.

Music : I started learning music in 8th grade, specifically piano but did not restrain myself just to piano, stopped taking the classes in the end of 10th grade but continued learning about music, I love music production and often when I am free I try and come up with my own beats or music, try and sample stuff around, it's no where near good but hey, it's fun. Decided to give a shot to playing blues after wishing to be able to play blues for quite sometime. Learnt E blues scale across the fret board. 
I can't play for shit now but I think I am getting there.  For languages, I would suggest Duolingo. Keep in mind that they are good only for teaching you the basics - you‚Äôll have to do a lot of research yourself for the finer things. I still recommend it as a hands-on method. It‚Äôs what I used to learn German (according to the Goethe Institute, I am a B1 level learner).

Oh, and don‚Äôt try Russian with it as a complete beginner. They teach you absolutely nothing about the alphabet, they expect you to figure it out on your own.

If you are interested in electronics, you could try your hand at Arduino. There are a lot of resources on the Internet. You can also find some pretty good books out there.

Edit: The German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle has a really good series of completely free tutorials for learning German. Here‚Äôs a link: http://www.dw.com/en/learn-german/s-2469 Programming: I once searched 'how to make games in notepad' and the rest is history.  
 
Music: Downloaded some pdfs of books on music theory from tor, installed a free DAW (lmms) and binged on busyworksbeats Youtube channel. What you consider a sophisticated equipment? Playing drums- Picked it up in school where teacher had taught the bare minimum basics.
Later parents got a set for brother who was learning from an instructor. Started playing to songs and learnt how to play. Performed with friends at college fests.  I love woodmaking, even as a kid when my house woodwork was going on, I used to go hangout with the carpenters, take some plywood, chisel, hammer and make weird things.

Always hoped one day I would get into it, but no time, money nor a place for such a hobby.  Cooking: Started early when I was in 8th grade. From basic Indian dishes, I've come a long way and today I'm extremely passionate about it. Taught myself a whole bunch of cuisines and cooking methods. I try to learn new techniques of cooking, how to mix flavors and how to develop a dish that would mirror a professional's work. Someday I hope to open up my own high end restaurant.  


Music: Started with the flute in 9th grade. Unfortunately, it didn't continue for long but it build up an interest for music. Took to the guitar a few years later. 7 years later, I still put in an hour's worth of practice every day. Best thing I do with my time. Metallica, Dream Theater, John Petrucci, Andy Timmons, Andy James are huge influences. Also, picked up carnatic and can pass off as a decent Veena player. Long way to go though. But the journey is extremely enjoyable.

  
Body building : No such thing as a healthy body and mind.  >  it'd be great if people can pick up basics of at least couple of trades and do it themselves.

Why would that be great? Cooking: Learnt through trial and error and Tarla Dalal after going abroad to study. Fairly decent cook now.

Coffees and teas: Worked as a barista part time while abroad instead of the usual TA job. Transformed from coffee hater to connoisseur. At any given time have atleast 20 different types of teas/coffees/beverages at home. 

Scuba diving: Spent a few formative years of my childhood in the Andamans. Went hiking and snorkelling almost every weekend. Have a PADI open water certification, and plan to get the higher certifications whenever I can afford it.

Emergency preparedness, first aid and survivalism: Have always been obsessed with it since I was a kid. Get into a lot of scrapes but never lost my cool. Took it more seriously in college after a bad accident. Carry first aid kit and other handy stuff with me all the time now.

Partly learnt to drive on my own. Took driving lessons a few days before I bought a car but the instructor was terrible. Watched a lot of videos, took advice from autohead friends over the phone. Practiced driving late at night with flatmates for moral support, drove them to ice Cream parlours and bakeries as incentive :P
Fell in love with driving and motivated to learn more driving skills and about cars in general.

Currently trying to learn French, coding, and microscope photography. Had tinkered around with microscopy a fair bit as a kid but lost touch after that.  Sleep, masturbation, reddit, cooking (maggi), eating,  resting,  programming Learnt photoshop,after effects on my own. Learning web development and ui/UX right now.

So my thoughts on how candidates should go about getting hired

**My college sucks. I‚Äôll be graduating in a year or two. What to do? What should I learn? What project should I do?**

Firstly, I'll just give a brief rundown of where I see the IT industry heading over the next 5-10 years. I think the 3 safest areas to build your career around are Android, iOS and Javascript. 

I do not see any other mobile OS breaking the dominance of Android or iOS in the next 10 years - the mobile OS wars are over and we are heading into the territory where Windows and OS X are now for the desktop. So learning Java/Android and Swift/iOS are safe bets. I do not see cross platform toolkits (Ionic, Xamarin etc) expanding beyond a niche so you don't need to worry about them. 

For web based apps, Javascript will always be evergreen since it is impossible for browsers to change the HTML/CSS/JS paradigm. And even for serverside, it looks like Node.js (a web framework written in Javascript) will beat out Ruby on Rails (web framework written in Ruby) and Django (a web framework written in Python) eventually. However it isn't clear who'll win the client side framework wars (React? Vue? Angular? Some new framework?) so this is a tricky part. However, client side frameworks are fairly simple and learning one should provide a roadmap to learning all others.

My recommendation - pick either Javascript (Node.js + one of React/Vue/Angular) or Android/Java or iOS/Swift. Keep in mind though that Android/Java and iOS/Swift are more likely to be popular in consumer apps while Javascript (web apps) are more likely to be popular in business apps. Business apps generally quietly make lots and lots and lots of money but consumer apps are more fun to work on. Choose wisely. 

Now you've picked one - what project to do? Pick a hobby you have - music? photography? fitness?. *Make something that you will use everyday in this hobby*. For example, if fitness is your hobby then you can make a fitness goal tracking app. Divide the project into different levels of progression. Level one can be a simple way to log your workouts. Level two can be adding user profiles so you can see your friends workouts. Level three can be adding GPS tracking. Level four can be adding tracking diet. And so on. By the time you go for an interview, this project with all its different modules will be like your baby and you'll be able to spend hours talking about it.

Its important to pick a project where the app you'll build is something you will use. You'll never use a library management system or restaurant order management system so there is no point building these types of apps even though they most commonly show up when you search for ""app ideas"".

**<Insert Story of Company Recruitment Being Terrible/Time in Company Being Terrible>. Can you recommend me good companies?**

This is tricky. Sometimes, especially in big companies, they can be both great and terrible at the same time - because its your manager who usually sets the experience in the company. I can't really recommend but I can give some steps for finding ones. Firstly do not subscribe to cliches like that MNCs = evil, crappy work and startups = force of good, exciting work or Indian companies = all suck, crappy and US companies = amazing, high quality work. They are plenty of well run, great MNCs and plenty of terrible startups and well run Indian companies and crappy US companies . 

Here you'll have to put aside your programming skills and work on your social engineering skills. First, try and identify who'll be your manager. Ask your interviewers who'll be your manager after you are selected. Try and read up on him, web, his blogs, Linkedin etc. Try and see if can use your web stalking skills to find some ex-employees of him. Take them out for coffee or beer and try and get a sense of how they feel like their manager it. It might sound like too much work but its better than spending a year in hell counting down the days to when you can get your job and and move on from your nightmare of a manager.

**Certifications? Yay or nay?**

**NAY NAY NAY A HUNDRED TIMES NAY**. I can't believe we are still asking this question. I have yet to see a certification that actually was helpful. The only companies that seem to care about certifications are the ones that issue them themselves e.g. Cisco. 

**Time gap, failed papers, no degree, marks too low or something else negative. What to do?**

There is little you can do about it. A company will ever have a policy on it (e.g. not hire people without graduate degrees or with supplies) and there is nothing you can do about it OR they will not have a policy on it in which they will almost always hire you if you are good enough since there is a shortage of good CS engineers and all companies are desperate. Just make up some story to explain all these - family could not afford, medical reasons, family emergency etc a bit of white lies is better in this case than brutal honesty (I decided to just play video games all semester).

**Can I work with you?**

I should have written the rant 3 years ago when I was still recruiting :). Unfortunately, about 2 years ago I decided to just keep my business on autopilot mode. This meant transiting out of full time employees to short term contractors. I little over 30 now - have sufficient savings from both working in USA and from my business and will eventually sell my business in 1-2 years so I have no financial urgency to work for the next couple of years. So, I am just taking it easy mostly these days, trying to think of what new adventures await and shitposting on Randia =). ",redweddingsareawesom," > And even for serverside, it looks like Node.js (a web framework written in Javascript) will beat out Ruby on Rails (web framework written in Ruby) and Django (a web framework written in Python) eventually. 

What about the fact that Python is gaining more and more importance across the world due to its liberal syntax and universal applicability? Apart from Django, there is also Flask and both are used often these days since its very easy to install and get going for a web application using them.  [deleted] How's the market for VR? 

How's the startup scene in India? I see that everyone is ready to jump on the bandwagon to start their own ventures. 

Does a GitHub profile with completed projects impress the recruiter?

What more different technologies are good to learn? Apart from Android/iOS/WebDev. I see that India lags behind the race in AI. Thanks a lot for the advise. >>>My college sucks. I‚Äôll be graduating in a year or two. What to do? What should I learn? What project should I do?

Indian BE / BTech courses are useless  (Atleast untill i completed my engineering). Take up courses from Coursera / Watch videos from an inspiring professor (Steven Skeina / Gilbert Strang / Andrew Ng). I mean .. Read some real computer science. https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses is a nice compilation. 

As a CS student. You should have written atleast 10,000 lines of code before you graduate. This can be i the form of assignments / Projects anything. 

If your fundamentals of Data Structures, Algorithms, Discreet Math, OS, Networks, Databases, Programming Languages, Some Basic Compilers are clear you (Not rot learning. You should have created an basic Database for joy of creating it atleast once. If not created atleast thought about it.) and you can code. You are a hot asset for the job market.

I disagree with the idea of learning Android / Javascript / Locking down to a programming language @ College. You should form your opinions based on liking to make something exciting and not based on market conditions. What you learn today will all change in 6 months. > I think the 3 safest areas to build your career around are Android, iOS and Javascript.

I have entirely opposite view. 

TLDR; focus on next wave. Focus on old stack. Those are gold stack.

I think Mobile Apps (non-gaming), as we know it from 2007-17, are dead or will be dead soon. Nobody needs another photo app or messaging app or social network or travel app or you name it. Nobody needs Uber clone or Amazon clone. Bottom line: People aren't making money in consumer apps. Only few players that have huge, huge brand presence will survive.

So, What about enterprise mobile apps? Here is problem: Most wants a solution that works both on iOS and Android also works on PC browser. They don't want to spent on 3 platforms (front-ends). It's too expensive to develop and maintain. ""Nononono...gimme a cheaper solution. What about responsive design?"" - this is a kind of response comes from enterprise. I'd avoid hybrid frameworks. They either works 80-90% close to likes of native apps or don't work at all. 

What about next wave? There is one. Just follow top 3 players - Apple, Microsoft and Google. They all talk about one thing - AI. They call it in many names Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, ANN, so on. Basically, 50 year old wine in new bottle. So, we are back to old stack - C/C++, Python, and bigdata. Yes, new languages are there like R & D lang, but those have niche use. Java is still king in enterprise space. Another huge space is data visualization.  Can we please call it social skills as opposed to social engineering? This is a great post, I wish I had this kind of guidance when I was starting out. Thanks man! I'm restarting my career but this is still good advice - shall share it with juniors who often ask me questions :) Heck, this is some solid advice! Thanks a ton! >And even for serverside, it looks like Node.js (a web framework written in Javascript) will beat out Ruby on Rails (web framework written in Ruby) and Django (a web framework written in Python) eventually

Why do you think so? Python is on the uptick on the server side since more than a couple of years now Any advice for the people stuck in services companies like infy, Accenture  Commenting after a long time because programming is very dear to me.

In addition to OPs advice, you will find more programming related advice you need here:
[http://norvig.com/21-days.html]http://norvig.com/21-days.html

And if you haven't read it yet, please read ""The Practice of Programming"".
 I'm surprised to not see c# on the list. The bulk of enterprise backend is on c#/.net and *not* RoR. Once .net core becomes stable, c# is going to be a major player in linux environments too. Not to mention that it's a great language and comes with awesome tooling.   Node.js? Lol somebody's been reading a lot of HackerNews. Node is a complete no go as far as large applications are concerned. Even the area Node was most popular in, i.e. web services has companies picking Java(Spring) over Node due to the complete lack of ""Enterprise"" quality support or robustness in any of its libraries. The only people using Node are 10X startups that can't afford to hire a dedicated backend team. Terrible ecosystem, NPM is a mess and JavaScript in and of itself is a horrible language due to reasons too verbose to cover here. 

Quote me on this Java/Python are not dying anytime soon in the next ten years. > have sufficient savings from both working in USA and from my business and will eventually sell my business in 1-2 years so I have no financial urgency to work for the next couple of years. So, I am just taking it easy mostly these days, trying to think of what new adventures await and shitposting on Randia =).

For the ones looking for guidance, this is the biggest takeaway here. Most of the shitposting you see here is from well settled folks, businessmen, or press reporters. They have all the time in the world to do all this shit.

I won't say more - but If you are in your teens, in college, not in a steady job, not having a couple of crores in your bank account - you should seriously reconsider your reddit karma points.

 The bar is not using a database. It's thinking about how it works internally. Say .. Trying to relate to how a BTree probability stores all the tweets in Twitter. Serverside is PHP losing steam? I am planning to start learning webdev. But see Maching Learning/AI getting popular. Which one to go for? I am very average at math at best. r/cscareerquestions I spent 3 years in between my 10th and diploma to pursue music and actually achieved something to show for it. Can i show that to my interviewers if they ask for the gap?  I'm doing my CS degree from a relatively top college in my city. Started just a few weeks ago. I want to work on cutting edge tech. Might do masters from the US. Is there anything specific that I can do to stand out from the crowd ? Any languages to focus on? Any general advice for me ? I think you are wrong about advising what people should learn. I learned html/css/javascript without doing market research, now I am jobless because all I see are java related jobs. Now, I am learning java. I sometimes see nodejs jobs on job portals but most of them are startups and pay very less. There is huge demand for node in remote jobs but they don't hire freshers.

In India, if you want job, you have to learn java.  There is a good future for data science too..  What could be your advice about java based server side programmimg. Is learning spring/ java ee worth it? But do we really need all these webdevs. Certainly you can make quick sites and make some easy cash but with the already inflated webdevs, how many are really good at designing sites. I mean with proper css and not some college level project css. In my opinion, still the way to go is to strengthen your fundamentals and go for DS and Algo. And if you want indepth knowledge go for Compilers and OS atleast the basics of understanding.",Photography,2017-08-24 19:48:13
"Hey guys, I could use some advice right now.",27,7tl3qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7tl3qv/hey_guys_i_could_use_some_advice_right_now/,37,"I'm a Class 12 student, and the CBSE board exams aren't far away. I've not studied much my entire life, as I was able to manage upto 10th without having to study. 11th was a huge kick in the ass for me - but I've learnt nothing and have still not started studying. 


I've been thoroughly incapacitated by depression- which I've had for about five years now- and cannot hold a routine for shit. I'm taking therapy and medication, but depression isn't the only issue apparently, anxiety is a huge problem too. While the suicidal thoughts did recede for a while, they're coming back now, because of how big and final the board exams feel. I know I am going to fuck it up. I probably won't fail it, but anything below 90% is insignificant for OC anyway (I think).

So many people are helping me, yet I've done nothing but disappoint. Doesn't help that my family is filled with over-achievers. I am emotionally drained and exhausted. If I have to redo this year, I'd rather drop out or kill myself. What do I do now? What does a guy who fucks up his education do? I do shitty photography, and play shitty guitar. I am not good enough at either of them for it to be of any significance. I don't know if I will ever be able to push myself to actually study, because that's something I've been fooling myself with for the last year.


I have a practice practical exam tomorrow, and have not started shit for it. Fucked up every other revision exam. Every exam this year has been a disaster.

What can I do?
",darthvadertheinvader," I'm also a class 12 student like you. For studies I would say ignore all the other books now. Ask your friends for an Oswaal chapterwise question bank (it costs 150 rs each and you get all subjects). Study every single question in that and I guarantee that you'll get a very good score (those books are my lifeline). If you can,try to get your parents to buy the Oswal book for your stream which has all previous year question papers of all subjects (it costs 500 rupees). The chapterwise books will help you to get familiarised with the shit in each chapter and the big book with previous year papers will help you understand how board questions are asked.
About practical exam I too have it tomorrow and I haven't opened my book (It's the model practicals right? .You don't have to worry much. It's designed to be a help for the poor performing students and the teacher in your school and the external examiner has an arrangement between them on how much marks to be given. 
I suppose you have written 2 model exams by now. The first one was supposed to be the easy one and second is supposed to be the hardest ever. Your boards won't be like any of them ( not too easy not too hard). 

If you are in a relationship or trying to find someone to fuck then forget about it for now. You already have so much stress and all the shit associated with a teen romance is not worth your time now. I myself only study some 1 hr a day but howmuch study time you require varies from person to person. 

While avoiding relationship shit is a good idea,never ditch your friends. Call someone everyother day and talk. Or go out on Sundays and eat or something. It has a very good effect on your mind.

Please ask me if you want to know anything more. 
P.S :- I'm also another shitty Guitar player :) TIL randia has a lot of 12th graders.  Just remember one thing,

**""If Past History was all to the Game, the  richest people would be librarians.""**

Now Go out and Kill it.
No matter, how shitty it has been, you have been through everything.

Now for once, try your level best. 
Go there and Kill it.

Edit: Have Given my 12th boards.  I can really really feel you there man. I'm also a student studying in 12th grade and my final practicals are on two days from now. I really think you should start with small steps towards realising your goal. Don't feel bad. Don't think your the only one who is facing this situation where they have to decide what to do with their future. Parental and peer pressure force us to strive for something which we do not desire. I'm definitely not in the position to give advice to somebody else but I really wanted to help you since I can relate with the problems you are facing. I'm not weak at Studying but I don't possess the will to achieve something in life. I procrastinated the whole year thinking I'll finally study at the end but it's really biting me in the ass. Try to do something however small it may be, to do something right in your life which will bring you happiness. The Educational system is however shit. But that doesn't mean we cannot achieve filtering these shitty phases of our life. I'm just saying that I can really correlate with your situation. Be Happy! [deleted] Hey man, I appeared for the board exams last year with PCM-CS as my stream. 

First of all, I want you to know that you still have plenty of time. 2 months are more than sufficient to comprehensively cover your board exam syllabus provided you put in consistent efforts.

Now, if you are also from science background, then I would definitely recommend the Arihant books, atleast for CS, chemistry and physics. For maths, theory can be very easily covered with just the NCERT books. For mock tests and revision questions, try U-Like.

If there is anything else that you feel uncertain about, feel free to hit me up :D

All the very best for your exams.  Hey it is okay man. I passed last year. Just do past year papers and you'll pass with decent marks. They ask the same questions year after year. If you are a creative dude when you go through the papers you'll see a pattern in questions. Section C usually is limited to 3 types of questions irrespective of the subject. 
Here is what I did when I went through depression during 12th. I took one step at a time. First I worried about unit tests. Then I worried about mid terms. Then practicals and prelims and so on and so forth. I am sure this won't help. I know it. I've been where you are. But it is something you have to get through. 
Look, you will get through this man. Believe me.  And everything will work out in the end even if boards don't. So just try your level best. And even if you feel you're alone trust me you're not. You have Reddit man. You can make a throw away account and post a request right here to just speak to someone in private messages and pour your heart out. I am sure someone will reply.  Bro idhar sab tujhe is style me padh uss style me padh bolengay but Tu inki sunna matt. 
Tujhe muth Marke padhna h toh padh, let ke padhna h toh padh , londiya patana h toh pata. Tu chill marr. Aram se padh , enjoy kar. 

Experience ke liye padh agar Kuch mann Na kare, Kuch instrument seekh , Kuch skills sekh. Zindagi me chutiyapa Aur depression toh aatey rahega life me, bas maze se handle kar. Me 11th me hoon , Meri fati padhi h , depress rehta hoon but I‚Äôm trying to enjoy my life now. 

Trying to understand crypto currency world, knowledge ke liye . 

Skills develop karo , Kuch kar na sako toh.

Baaki all the best ;)

PS: I might sound like some stupid bindas type kid but I tired my best to help you out  If you still have time, start solving question bank boom. I solved 10 year maths paper for my 2013 CBSE exams and it helped me immensely, also, on't forget about miscellaneous exercise in ncert textbook.

As for Physics, analyse last year papers. In my year, the entire paper was almost theory based with little numerical based questions.  Are you trying to score high grades or only planning to pass? Story of my life. There's nothing you can do at this point. 

Just push yourself as much as you can. Study as much as you can in this 2 months. Don't worry too much about the marks you will get. Not getting into the best college is not end of the world. Even if you get into 2nd tire college, you can make it up by studying well and scoring good marks in college.
 All good advice in here. Just to add to it, get rid of Time sinks like Reddit or other social media. For 2 months if you put in 6 to 8 hours of effort, you‚Äôre nearly guaranteed a good result. Ration entertainment and also rest.  Study programming. Believe it or not, I studied for a month and got an under 100 JEE rank. You can do it too.",Photography,2018-01-29 00:14:34

A Science student who wants to pursue Film-making,7,8reoj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8reoj5/a_science_student_who_wants_to_pursue_filmmaking/,6,"Hi, a **12th NRI PCM** student here. PCM because my school didn't have arts and my dad insisted on science. I have been dreading it since my first exam.Anyway, I plan to join **Symbiosis Pune** or any other college for **BA in Mass Comm**. next year and advance into the field of **filmmaking** (or something related to making films/videos/photography in general) after the Undergrad.

My Primary question is how adversely does applying for BA as a science student affect my probability of getting in?

Any suggestions by other aspiring filmmakers or others who are filmmakers? wanna know what you guys plan/or have done.

Any Alumni or students from SCMC or any other BA Mass Comm programme here that think I should do something else wanna give any advice are also welcome.",DankFrost726," It really depends what aspect of film making appeals to you. Do you want to join the commercial film industry? Is it films, or the visual medium, that appeals to you? Would something like ad films appeal to you? Does the technical aspects of films interest you more, like cinematography or editing? Do you feel drawn to the creative storytelling, perhaps as a writer?

Film making is a vast field, yet I would place a distinction between the art of film making, and the film industries. To learn the craft, there is little else you can do other than actually go to film school. 4-5 years later, you have the technical skills to make films. If the industry is what interests you, you'll have to work your way up, and your degree might get you through the door, but you'll have to put in the struggle. Expect to spend many years doing underpaid work and moving your way up. There is little else that can be done other than work on film production in a small capacity, and move up over time, and the work doesn't require film degrees. You learn on the job. Work as a Director's Assistant, then a 2nd Assistant Director, then AD, and so on. You make contacts, and that's what works more than anything else.

It's hard to recommend a particular path to you, since the technical specialisations really are more passion driven. Most people I know who have joined the industry after film school have struggled to find their footing, in an industry overrun with film school graduates with little appreciation of the particularly kitchy aesthetics of the industry. The smoothest transitions I've seen is from people who approach it from a creative writing angle, and have done courses in script writing. Of course, that really depends on what your passion is. I have a friend working in film industry. His bachelors was in Visual Communications. Good luck. [removed] Being already in the field what I can add is that practical exp + contacts matter. Struggle is a big part in filmmaking. Though if you wish to be an independent professional and making films for youtube... just find a group of professionals with the same liking and start making films from day1.... Rest experience will teach you everything Just do it",Photography,2018-06-16 05:48:29
Its becoming hard/Impossible to find good CS jobs in India.,100,6v9vtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6v9vtx/its_becoming_hardimpossible_to_find_good_cs_jobs/,42,"But unlike some people, I am willing to dedicate more of my resources and skills to find the right fit.

Why can't employers do the same?

Edit: Some questions I read.

Z921 in their rant on another thread here:
> You need to have a hobby other than photography

Who are you to decide what hobby is worth my time? Sounds like you are the kind of person to micro-manage your employees and be on people's shoulders like vedhal is to vikramadithya. Also sounds like you are/will be the kind of parent who does not like what their child is doing and would like him/her to study engineering.

> DumbwitPatra:
> What is your expectation from an employer? How can I, as an employer, assess you and be sure you're unlike the others? Jobs ARE available. But the people aren't knowledgeable enough. Even engineering passouts with 80-85% can't crack simple dynamic programming questions. I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people. If you're one among them, you'll get a job. If you aren't, you need to have visible proof that you have put in efforts to specialize in a particular field. The guy who is leading the AI team in my company is from BBA background. He learnt AI and math from the internet, built some applications and had content that would show his efforts. If you do have something like that, take your idea to a hackathon. You'll have your idea recognized even if you don't win and will get a job. However, I'm not sure if i understood your question right. What are you expecting from your employer and what change do you want to see in the way hiring is done?

Quantitative Aptitude exams. The messages you are sending to your prospective employees are:

* You only care about speed and memorizing power and nothing else about the developer because all your talk of github profiles and other hobbies does not come into play until you see my resume yourself which is usually after all the written rounds.
* For all the talk of being the risk takers in the industry, you don't want to trust your prospective employee so you pass up on a potentially good employee who may not have the best aptitude test taking skills.

What you expect to happen:

* You assume good aptitude problem skills imply good problem solving skills.
* You assume people won't game the aptitude round and learn just enough to pass that round.
* You assume that all the brilliant programmers solve the problems in no time and you are left with a roster of excellent developers.

What usually happens:

* People game the system and just study how to solve the test problems.
* Actually good developers may not have the time to study aptitude problems because, surprise! they are busy learning actual programming. Many good developers get filtered out in the first round due to the lack of knowledge in aptitude.

> I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people.

15 or 20 students per college seems like the right amount of students who are actually passionate about their field. When the stakes are high, Skills go down a few notches. It's the observer effect. As soon as people find out they are being assessed or being watched they don't perform as well.

> What are you expecting from your employer?

* If you want Tom Cruise as your boyfriend, you need to be Cameron Diaz. If you want brilliant developers, you must be a innovating company who offers their weight in salary and/or Resume Value. If I am a good developer, then it is possible I know my worth. I am not going to put up with you for $400 a month or less.

* Stop taking credit for my work. I once heard that my friend got a pat in the back for making the company $12000. He never got a bonus or saw $1 of that money.

* I want you to stop whining and start treating employees like human beings. Pay them a proper wage and give them interesting problems to solve. Automate the boring stuff. Don't ask me to do the documentation manually. Haven't you heard of tools that do the documentation from comments in code?

* Once I am hired. I want a manager who actually understands what I am saying and not some prison warden who intimidates devs to get things done before a very early deadline that they came up with without consulting the devs. This is a sure way to make devs secretly hate you while burning out.

* I want reasonable work-life balance. I am passionate about programming, but I am a human being too.

* More investment into employee training or undergraduate education in the government. I know IT companies lobby a lot, so I expect them to actually put effort to improve the syllabus of colleges to suit what they want in terms of technical knowledge by diverting some money towards education.

Yes but I am not the one whining about not finding good developers. It is the employers looking for good developers but are not willing to pay them a living wage.

> People working as game testers for ‚Çπ10000 per month

There is your problem. Why are you not willing to pay more?

I am not personally looking for a job. I have one. It is good but I notice the bad side of IT occasionally. Namely the ""this will do"" attitude from people who expect a lot for less. It's about managing your expectations as an employer when you are asking your employees to manager their expectations of their salary.

",eskimoFry," even if you are technically sound just make sure you have a hobby other than DSLR photography, cause these a**holes doesn't find it a legitimate hobby, seriously these fellows needs to understand how tedious it is to make a good photograph with some nice bokeh(shallow depth of field) and hours of editing, and yeah you should have a five year plan, supposedly ""on your seat firing you"" is not an answer, it's a threat. /S Wasn't there a similar thread posted by some Employer looking for RoR people and an attached rant? Try freelancing, it works great especially if you are someone who has a lot of technical skills but unable to make a super presentation at interviews, etc. Agreed Companies want me to work on CONTRACT rather then FULL TIME.

At onr end of the spectrum you have Google paying upwards of a crore per annum to people from IISc. At the other end you have people working as game testers for 10000‚Çπ per month.  No it's not, it's actually pretty easy if you have the right competencies. A friend of mine (isn't even a CS or ECE grad, but is from a top college) wanted to switch jobs as a front-end developer. Got 3 offers of around 15LPA within a month, and decided not to interview with two other companies he had lined up.

I get emails from recruiters on Linkedin on a weekly basis. So does everyone I know.

You might have a point if you say you can't find jobs with a challenging CS component in India - but if you're looking for jobs that pay 7 figures, no dearth really. You need to work your way up to a top company (if you're not from a good college), and when you have it in your profile, jobs will be a-plenty. No What is your expectation from an employer? How can I, as an employer, assess you and be sure you're unlike the others?

I need some help in deciding what to do with my life. Any help would be appreciated.,36,7fxfgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7fxfgw/i_need_some_help_in_deciding_what_to_do_with_my/,22,"Sorry for this huge wall of text, but I have to be detailed in this because I need some help.

I'm in a very weird situation in life right now and could use some advice. Please be honest. I'll give you a little background about myself without trying to dox me. I am a 25-year-old graphic designer by profession. I graduated from an average college in 2013 with a degree in Journalism (one of the biggest mistakes of my life, especially in terms of the three years I lost). After graduating from college, I was in a tough financial situation, so I had to immediately get a job to support myself. Since I knew the basics of photoshop, I just applied for a job as a graphic designer with an agency and got it. I worked there for 8 months, and quit due to deteriorating mental health. After that, I spent about a year and a half battling that mental condition, which still affects me, and again, got a job as a graphic designer at a startup, due to financial strain. I worked at that job for 6 months (till the company closed down) and then got my current job, which I have been working at for around 1.5 years, again, because I have no other skills. Now, in this 1.5 years + 6 months, is where I properly learned the tools of design and got some idea of how the industry works on the design front. Again, I never had any ambition in this field, I just got into because I had no other skills.

Another thing about my ""career""; Since I said, I took this job out of desperation, I'll be honest with you about my skills. Design doesn't come naturally to me. I have zero thought process on how to design. I have to look at tons of other things (like brochures, ads etc.) to even begin conceptualizing a layout or color scheme. I have come across some seriously talented and dedicated designers and sometimes feels ashamed of myself on how I work. Also, I am not terrible at what I do. I am pretty decent. Especially when I put my heart to it. But over the last few months, my mental issues, lack of confidence and general bleak outlook on life has made my job harder.

Now, I feel, that this job has reached a plateau phase and I have to do something better with my life. I was wondering if I should enroll in National Institute of Design's Graphic Design Post Graduate program. I don't know if it will actually help me learn or improve my life and job prospects in any way, but so far, whatever I do, I learned on the job.

Now some other details. Right now, I get paid 30K a month out of which, if I live an absolutely frugal lifestyle (no eating out in fancy places, no beer, no trips, no shopping), I save around 5K minimum around 10K maximum. I am talking about in terms of savings. If I do plan to enroll, I will only be able to in the 2019-2021 Batch. I feel I will need a year to start properly saving up, get loans, writing all the entrance exams and preparing myself.

Now here are my other concerns. When I look at this roadmap, I will be ""job ready"" only by the age of 29. Which is a very scary thought for me, because I will be sorta back to square one. Another major issue for me is, even though my life is quite bleak, one of the few things in life that keep me going is the woman I love. She is not the kind who will ever pressurize me into marriage (even though her parents will) and she told me, if I am serious about this, she will convince them to wait for me to finish graduating.

I want to know, is this sudden jump worth the risk? Honestly speaking, I feel very depressed and quite often suicidal because of the mediocre life I have led so far, and nothing seems like a happy ending to me. Even thinking of this move, has taken a huge toll on my already deteriorating mental health. I am talking about if this will help me long term in terms of career opportunities. I don't aim to slack off and ""party"" through college if I get in. I am willing to slog to the point of death if this will actually help me.

What would really help me, other than general advice is, if anyone has studied in NID, they could tell me if the course is worth my time and money. Will I actually learn something there? Like I said, I am ready to work my ass off because I know I only have one shot at this and I don't want to botch that. Also, if you do know anyone who studied there, could you please link them to this post, or just ask them?

**Edit:** Hey guys. Sorry, I just saw the post now. Wasn't feeling to well and just wen't to bed after posting. First of all, thanks for taking your time and talking to me. I am sorry that I didn't state much of my technical knowledge and the source of motivation for me to even look up NID.

**Source of motivation:** So, like I mentioned above, I got into design because I HAD to get a job, and the only bankable skill I had was how to use photoshop. Everything else, I learnt on the job, mostly through trial and error. I started feeling a course in design would help me because it will give me a more structured approach into working.  A better understanding of layouts, colors, what works, what doesn't. Honestly, one of the biggest drawbacks I have is, convincing the client of the final design. Like, even when I present it to them, I do it with this weird look showing a huge lack in confidence, and that usually lets them ask me for multiple changes or with them saying they are not happy with the design. The current job I am working at, my boss is my friend from college, and he encourages me a lot to work without thinking of these things, but in the end, when I interact with the clients, this still happens. They say, yeah, the design is okay. Could we have another iteration? My friend is the one who convinces them into accepting the design saying a lot of business jargon. Bottom line is, I always see my work as mediocre and cannot accept it as what it is. I know, a Degree from NID won't immediately have an impact in my thought process, but I fell, I can at least support my self by saying, I do have an idea of what I want to do.

Another question I came across a few times with the answers you people wrote were whether I am looking to study for a bump up in the salary? My answer is primarily no. Yes, overtime I would love a nice paying job, but right now, it's more of me to learn something, because everything I do right now is from looking at other peoples works. I don't know how correct I am when I say this, but I feel that a degree from NID will add that prestigious college stamp, and help me get better opportunities and a better network too. And and some weight to me, mentally, in terms of confidence.

Technical Knowledge and hobbies - Adobe Illustrator (most proficient in this), Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. Hobbies - Photography (very amateur). I can write a bit of content too. But it's not something I would market.

Another weird point (I don't know if it's relevant) is, I am quite well versed in pop culture and ""western culture"" of sorts. The reason I am bringing this up is, I use this as a major influence when I work in terms of design. Many menus and interior decor designs I did for my clients (which they loved), were inspired from this and they said it looks and feels much different from boring things they usually see elsewhere. I mean, it's not a huge skill. Lot of people nowadays are more ""globalized"" and dazzle people with one liners from TV shows and all in their designs, but I just mentioned this, because the agency I work for got a lot of praise from these ""out-of-box-for-india"" style work.",roadmap_throwaway," Considering you already have a job as a designer, what makes you want to enroll in the PG course? Is it because you feel you'll improve? I think you ought to ask yourself if your heart is truly in this line of work. If it is, then I truly believe that there's no better education than vocation. Keep at it. Learn from your seniors and talented designers around you. Read books about it. Research it online. Do everything you can to build your portfolio. 30k for a year and a half's experience isn't bad. But yes, at 25, it might not feel like much. I think part of moving on is to accept that you've lost 3 years of your life. Just use it as motivation to get better, faster. You are not living a mediocre life. Earning more than 30k can be improved certainly, but is no reason to get suicidal. I'd strongly suggest to be patient with your career. Each one of us has a long way to go. I have worked as a designer in my early days and still dabble with it in my spare time. Now, I haven't gone to NID, but here goes.

> Design doesn't come naturally to me

* I assure you, the designers whose work you're impressed by, aren't natural born designers. It just takes a lot of time and effort. And btw, I go through the same thing in my field. Some people are just so goddamn good that you wonder if you can ever be at their level. I believe I can, and so should you. It just takes persistence.

* Join a design community like http://dribbble.com/ so that you can interact with other designers, get criticism, share your work, etc. subscribe to http://www.creativebloq.com/ and Chris Spooner https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/ among others for regular inspiration.
* Have a very simple personal website. Create a name / brand for yourself online.

Those are the basics. Now for career:

* As a general rule, I'm biased against ""studying design in a college"" per se. I have a feeling that if you were making more money, you wouldn't consider this either, am I right?
* To be honest about the salary, 30k seems pretty low. I've known designers to make between 50k - 1L easily. At an experience level of ~4-6 years. If you're really good and are able to make it as a creative director (generally > 10 years xp) for the company, there's a ton of money involved.
* You did not mention your skill profile. I'll assume Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. Fairly decent, but you need to diversify. There are multiple routes:
  * Art. You need to learn how to draw. You can combine digital art with design in many interesting ways. It is an excellent complement to design skills. Check out https://www.ctrlpaint.com/.
  * 3d modelling. Similar to the above. Check out http://blender.org/
  * Marketing. In the era of social media marketing, design and marketing have a close relationship. If you can brand yourself as a designer with a good grounding in marketing, more doors open up. If you're a total newbie, start here: https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/certification

There's a lot more to be said, but I hope this can get you started! Good luck :) If you know what you want to do and what will help you achieve that, I strongly advice you do that. For one thing all artists look at other things for motivation/reference.

This isn't limited to graphic design, all music,movies,games etc are all inspired or in some ways ""copied"" from something that existed before it.

So yeah there is no shame in looking looking at other things for ideas, everyone does it * Don't go to UNI again. Please don't! (even if you are willing to work/study hard)
* Like others said, learn from people at work, online communities, etc. 
* Start investing some of your money in the markets. You could spend time learning what you need to see/who you need to invest into, etc. (Just a little time everyday, in 2-3 years you'll have a nice portfolio helping you through stuff) 

> Design doesn't come naturally to me. I have zero thought process on how to design

Absolutely normal

> I have to look at tons of other things (like brochures, ads etc.) to even begin conceptualizing a layout or color scheme

An amazing way to start constructing your own stuff! Kudos (like seriously)

> Like I said, I am ready to work my ass off because I know I only have one shot at this and I don't want to botch that

Put this will power to work into acquiring financial knowledge. It is not hard, and it will greatly improve your thought process on a variety of things (What variety ? Its pretty subjective, but you'll connect the dots when you get there)

All the best, you are fucking young and there's a beautiful life ahead. Don't you ever fucking feel suicidal. You'll do great in life, guaranteed.
 [deleted] Best of luck :) Stealing (not copying) is the part of the design process. Nothing is truely original, All those great designers you see, they too refer to other's works. 


The best designs are the ones that go under most iterations not something that comes 'naturally'. Just keep doing it, study online, through books etc, colleges is not worth it imo.    As someone closely associated with NID and IDC, I would suggest that joining the institute for upping the salary bar isn't really a good move. My reason being that 

1) the syllabus hasn't radically changed to help students meet today's market needs. 

2) After working in the industry, you might come to feel that the institute fails to instil in you an insight into the business of design. As students however, it did not matter but that was a huge shortcoming for a passed out graduate.

3)Although the institute boasts of some of the most renowned alumni, it does not bank on them for furthering the knowledge base or helping current students learn from their experiences.

4) Most graduates I've have worked with opt to invest their time and energy in startups for a while, then MNCs for experiences in the corporate world and eventually start their own design firms.

Having said that, I must also add that if you are in it to LEARN design, there is just no stopping you. It's an amazing institute with top notch infrastructure, faculties and a delectable talent pool. Plus,they have  collaborations with global brands so if you are good, you will end up getting internships or jobs to the likes of Pininfarina. The institute tag definitely helps.

Or maybe you can start working under some designers for while and learn the trick of the trade. Shortlist some good names of people in your area of interest and start from there. Emailing/ cold calling whatever it takes. Just try.

All one can suggest is that make up your mind. Do you want to up the salary bar or get into learning nuances. Either way, you can do it. Just sort out your mind, stop thinking unwanted things. There are lots out there to help you out even if it might feel otherwise.

I am strongly recommending a 1-inch sensor pocket camera like the Sony RX100M3 or Canon G7X M2.

Otherwise, it will have to be a mirrorless camera. I know my smartphones but don't have the motivation to study the best camera options, especially ones available in India.

[R] Why are Indians blindly running after MONEY???,29,5zqaur,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5zqaur/r_why_are_indians_blindly_running_after_money/,99,"What i dont understand is that why do Indians run for Money!!!. Wherever i look, everyday, i see Indians trying to get squeeze every inch of a penny from customers, trying to sell everything possible. etc. 

The people working for salaries like 50k or even 90k or 1.5L a month, don't actually have a life. to be honest ( MY opinion)

Okay, a person earning 1.5 L a month (like a cousin in delhi does) is extremely busy all the time. I have seen high earning salaried class, going to offices from 7 AM (2 hour drive) , returning at 10pm. Sometimes, they are thrown away to projects in other cities for months at a time. 

And in some places, Saturdays are also working. and on top of that, fierce competition, stress, anxiety. 

I know a person earning 3L a month. He has to go to office at 8am, and he returns at 11pm. He works in exports (Merchandiser). The stress he is in everyday in unbelievable. He suffers from insomnia and panic attacks. Is this MONEY worth your health???

People are dying In exchange for What? MONEY? shit doesnt get more stupid then this. 

Before people start burning me and asking me how i live my life. I basically started from scratch with clear goals in Mind when i made my own company at age of 21
1) Work only 4 hours a day
2) Holidays - 2 atleast in a year
3) No Stress related work
4) Debtfree forever
5) Self-Sustaining income
6) Passive income from investments

Today, even if i dont work, i can live through my life from passive income. Hell, i can live even without passive income. 

And a lot of Indians can live like the way i live. But they choose not to , for one simple reason. MORE MONEY. 

A lot of people i know personally. like 95% of them, live under loans. Car loans, house loans, credit card lines, PC limits, etc. They are basically stuck in a vicious circle of being a spend thrift and then working their asses off to pay the monthly obligations and creating more obligations for themselves for a FAKE future. 

Although when you transfer yourself into a more frugal and acceptable way of living, you will realise that the true happiness if being with your family, spending time with kids, chilling out in the sun and not thinking you will be late for office. And most importantly, being DEBT-FREE. Only after that you can think of creating Self-Sustaining earning for yourselves. 

Just ask yourself few questions and maybe they don't all apply to you, and maybe a few of them do. But if they do, just think why are you doing this? and creating Stress for yourself.
1. Why do you need a phone that costs 40k+?
2. Why do you need to buy a house on loan?
3. Why buy a car on loan? 
4. Why spend what you dont have yet (C.C.)
5. Why work more than 45 Hours a week? 
6. Why you go on a holiday and post pictures on facebook EVERYTIME? (Occasionally its okay)
7. Why do you put pictures of the food you eat on Insta, FB, Twitter??? 
8. Does it feel like, you are travelling to various places just to put pictures on your facebook and insta??? and if it does, why do you do it?
9. Dont you feel that your Job is hindering in doing what you actually LIKE? (Travelling, Hiking, Trekking, Exploring) etc.
10. Even if you can afford the most expensive phones? why do you ACTUALLY need it? have you asked yourself that? 
11. Have you lost touch with various people you loved? and WHY have you? Lack of TIME?
12. Do you want to learn something technical and CANT DO SO EVER? (Guitar, photography, boating, climbing, learning a piano, learning another language)

These are just A FEW of the things, which everyone of you must ask yourself. Because ultimately at the end, We are all going to die, one way or another. And to be brutally honest, a lot of people are going to regret how they lived their life. Not everything is about ""MORE MONEY"". And when you die, most probably you will be forgotten in 50 years. and that too if you become a celebrity. Otherwise, chances are you will be forgotten instantly. 

I have even seen people mentioning a ""BALANCE"". What balance? that you work for 6 days a week for 8 hours a day and then Sunday is a BALANCE? because that shit doesn't sound like a 50/50 balance to me. We sleep around 8 hours a day. And the rest of activities we SHOULD be doing in a day would constitute for around 7-8 hours (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Exercise, Errands). What you are left with is about 8 hours FREE. in which most of you only WORK. Exercise is totally forgotten. and even that 2 hours for exercise is given to work. 

Where is the time for yourself? to contemplate? to think? to feel about yourself? to do things you ACTUALLY want to do? 

I think even working for 4 hours a day is TOO MUCH. and should infact be only 2-3 hours. 

Money is just something the BANKS have created out of thin air, on which they ask you to pay an interest!!!. 

Have you thought about where the INTEREST money comes from which you pay??? . You guessed it, BANKS print them too. There is no Way out of the DEBT system. 

Only changes in your lifestyle and the way you feel about the world can result in self sustainable income and environment , where you can do things you want. 

Think about these things deeply. 


",modgill," I read your post and agree to it. Maybe you can edit the post to make it more readable and present the people with questions they need to really ask themselves.

This is something either wrong or something I couldn't understand:

>Have you thought about where the INTEREST money comes from which you pay??? . You guessed it, BANKS print them too. There is no Way out of the DEBT system.

Couldn't digest your claim that you started a company at 21 and can now live your life all with passive income. Mind shedding some light on this? How to generated passive income? [deleted] Because it helps me buy the things that make me happy. As this is a philosophical post I won't be the guy who says shit like ""21 year old kid doesn't know how the monetary cycle works""

Have you ever thought that many people are 'blindly' running after money because they have different goals and responsibilities than you? 

When you are out living your carefree and responsibility free life trekking or traveling the world do realize that the airline company employees who get you there have to work 45 hrs + to support ppl like you. Same for hotel employees, farmers, cooks, maids etc. heck your passive income is generated because someone out there is busting their ass off to pay you.

Privilege is a mysterious thing. All of us are blind to our privilege and how advantaged many of us have had birth which supplemented our hard work and allowed us to succeed. 21 year old me was blind to it and thought like you. 31 year old me knows it's BS but hopes we all move to your vision of the world. Well , I do partially agree with what you said. I spent 10 mins introspecting over some of the questions you raised. 

I am debt free, did not pursue education abroad like so many of my friends and peers. I completed my Masters in Biotech here in India. 
I earn well for starters, not that I'm complacent, but Im 24 years old, I earn enough for myself and my family and entirely support the household expenses each month from my salary. 
I have minimum desires, im not fond of cars or bikes and my company pays for my travels everywhere. 
Im quite happy with my job, get lots of free time, i enjoy occasional drinks and smoke up often. 

However, if you are implying that I should be content to do the same thing all my life , earning the same amount forever, living in the same city for the rest of my life, then thats where I disagree. 

I want to stay debtfree, I want to pursue other things in life apart from work, however I definitely need a steady cash flow into my bank account every month for me to able to enjoy those simple pleasures like buying meat, alcohol, weed, watching movies, regular doctor check ups etc.

I don't post pictures on facebook, I don't instagram my food, I don't party with large groups of people etc and in a way I think I need to keep earning money to enjoy certain privileges like being able to afford aloofness, privacy, freedom to not be a participant or spectator to anything religious. 

So I really don't understand the message that you're trying to convey as the way I see it, you do always need more money to even enjoy some of the things that you listed Reading this post, I half expected a ""Be your own boss. PM me for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" kind of MLM message in the end.    OP, why is a problem to run after monies? If one chose to be materialistic, why is it an issue that makes you rant? OP to make it very short:

we are not a fully developed country + huge population.

so money solves a lot of problems to move on with life (basic + luxury)
and due to high pop. govt cannot provide a safety net. you are on your own. so money.

you cannot live without money unless all you want to do is farm and consume that produce and survive life

 >I basically started from scratch

>made my own company at age of 21 

nice /r/humblebrag He wants you guys to know how good his lifestyle is and how good his lifestyle choices are. 

Tum sabh chutiye ho penchod!

""Money is just something the BANKS have created out of thin air, on which they ask you to pay an interest!!!."" OP seems had a bhaang overdose at holi ! Because we need the MONEY!!

Is this just a rant or is there a serious point? I didn't read it all but it didn't look like there was.


edit: oh a hippie I think my life goals are similar to OP's. I'm a fresher who recently got a low paying but interesting job offer. My life goal isn't actually to earn a lot. I just want to be able to have a good lifestyle, buy stuff for my hobbies like gaming and able to play TT in clubs while at the same time, reducing my stress and time devoted to work, though not as low as OP's as I'd get bored.

Probably in the distant future if I want to raise a child, that would want me to start earning more money. Hopefully I'd be penny wise to understand how to make investments for passive income. OP, I wish everyone had the same fortune as you, but I live on a research scholars stipend and still leave at 8am and return at 9pm. More money would also help but frankly money doesn't have a direct correlation with work hours or balance of life.

I like what I do so spending long hours doesn't really matter. Would I spend the same hours at a desk job crunching numbers for double the salary? Hell no.... 

But I do have my stressful days. Expectation is the mother of all evils they say, so the more u expect the more u worry. :D 
 So that, once we get it we can post things like these Because everyone wants to retire fast. Because some people actually like what they do, and would prefer being ""busy"" to the alternative?

There are a number of reasons why ""running after money"" (aka seeking jobs that pay well) are a good thing:

1. You tend to work with smart and driven people, as opposed to passive sloths who are just waiting for the next paycheck.
2. More money = more freedom. Working really hard for a while and ensuring that you have 10-15 lacs in savings gives you the freedom to take a year off to travel or to try out an entrepreneurial venture.
3. You can do more good in the world with more money. You can give much more to charity once you have more money. You are also better able to give the best care to your parents if they fall sick, buy equipment for rural communities, regularly contribute to crowdfunding charities and the like. Its easy to be this nonchalant about money when you have it. Try saying this to people who live hand to mouth. 



You are an insensitive and ignorant person.  [deleted] If ""those people"" don't spend any money economy will slowdown and you are gonna start crying looking at how your investments are doing.  People need to continue buying stupid shit working insane hours so that the economy grows. You are just smart and happy with your financial life.  Bro, you make some excellent points and ask some pertinent questions.  Sure, money can't buy happiness. But it can buy you things that make you happy.  I run with open eyes. 

I will charge you Money to read the whole post.  Balance is important, however, if individuals are greedy let them be. Not much you can do except learn and move on. Because money = self satisfaction...indians believe if they have money they will happily. Who doesnt like money here? deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4693  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/41426) Op that is your view of the world, you rank free time higher that the latest phone. Why look down on someone who wants the latest phone ?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias read up you did well and you think everyone will be able to do well.

Maybe just maybe some people have seen what it feels like to have nothing while everyone around is doing well, so they tend to rank what they want higher that what you then they should want  It's really difficult to run after anything when blind. slaves with benefits.

Everything looked good - It's a got a nice google map showing currently available bais, interviews, etc. It even has testimonials.

I was going through these, and then I saw something familiar - [Screenshot just in case they delete it.](https://i.imgur.com/hS0XLiS.png)

'Gauri Desai' was a stock photo. How was I sure? Because that [same](http://shethepeople.tv/pune-ensuring-womens-safety-on-new-years-eve/) damn [photo](http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120902/spectrum/main1.htm) comes up [whenever](http://www.jobsforher.com/2015/04/why-are-indian-mothers-leaving-the-workforce/) someone wants to write about [Indian women](https://www.quora.com/topic/Indian-Women) or [their safety.](http://www.amity.edu/PressClippings/PressDetails.asp?id=6708)

So now pretty convinced that Gauri Desai was fake, I did a reverse image search on the others. Some of the results are hilarious, and others just sad.

""Leela Thakur"" is actually [Myleeta Aga,](http://www.adgully.com/exclusive-up-and-close-with-bbc-worldwide-s-myleeta-aga-60254.html) head of BBC's India Business.

""Suresh Kakkar"" is [a blog writer, Dave.](http://shortsforwinter.com/hiking-hunt-lake-trail-whiteshell-provincial-park-manitoba/) (Scroll down for the selfie)

""Anil"" is a [stock photo.](http://www.istockphoto.com/photo/cheerful-young-indian-couple-male-female-embrace-isolated-on-white-3861844)

""Rashmi Pande"" is actually [Harjinder, who migrated to Canada 20 years ago.] (https://diversevoices.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/portrait-11-harjinde-2/) A short interview of hers is on the site, and that's quite interesting.

If the photos are fake and so poorly chosen, I'm pretty sure the testimonials are fake too. I definitely don't trust these guys enough to send someone to my home.


TL;DR: bookmybai.com says big and lazy lie. Don't trust them to get a bai.",lexan," This is noob level marketing

Kids, here's what you do if you want to use fake testimonials:

* Buy them off Fiverr.com

* OR, take stock images with rights from istockphoto or something

* OR, take creepshots of your neighbors

* OR go to MorgueFile.com, find an image with plenty of people, crop it to focus only on one person's face. Google reverse search will be uselsss.

`Anil Deshpande` is a Marathi sir name, which is fine seeing how they operate in Mumbai and Pune. BUT according to the testimonial, he's looking for a Tamil maid!? wut?
 If ALL testimonials have good photos, they are not testimonials.  [deleted] Thanks for the expose' man.

Such coders, much wow Can't believe you'd bother with a website that calls any help a ""bai"" to begin with. I do like the name bookmybai....

But some serious rookie level mistakes in setting up their visuals.

India has become a gold mine for such service providers - make an app get VC money and roll in cash. Having such a huge population means that grabbing even 5% market share translates to a huge chunk of users/transactions. Can the mods handling the R/India twitter account please post this. This needs to be out there.  Hi guys, 
My name is Anupam Sinhal and I am the founder of BookMyBai.com. I felt it was important for me to intervene in this thread due to the negativity that is spreading around.

Firstly, to clear the air, BookMyBai.com is as genuine as it can get. We are a 3-year old startup and have been in this space through my other startup www.nanojobs.com which is more into the B2B space. 
I believe there is a concern regarding the testimonials on the site. Please be assured that the testimonials on the site are accurate and genuine and we have not posted fake/dummy reviews on the site. Having said that - the development of the portal was outsourced to a company who picked up a few stock images from the internet because they did not have photos of all my clients. We have already initiated the process of terminating the contract of the development company which built the portal. However I would like to repeat - the text and the names in the testimonials are 100% accurate and true. The images were picked up by the development company last week since they wanted some images and we did not have photos of all clients who posted testimonials.We are also willing to share the contact details of the employers who have posted the testimonial to clear the air.

A business where you provide a domestic help is about trust and safety and we are very well aware of the fact. We are in this business to eliminate the fraud/unethical maid agencies so that the employers/households can have a hassle-free process of hiring a trusted maid.  We have over 3000 satisfied clients give us references of their friends and family and this is possible only when they are satisfied and happy with the service.

The testimonials were not a shady trick and no startup-founder in his senses would want to pick up stock images and post them on the portal especially when you have planned a marketing campaign. This was a mistake made on the developers end. Having said that, we are not washing our hands of it. We have pulled off the incorrect photos and the correct photos will be up and live soon.

We do not adopt or need any sort of marketing tricks like Guerrilla Marketing 101. 

About caste/religion based discrimination: From what I understand about caste/religion based discrimination, a caste/religion based discrimination happens when a hindu/muslim maid approaches us for work and we say: ‚ÄúI wont list your profile because you are a hindu/muslim‚Äù. BookMyBai lists every profile/maid who approaches us who clears the background verication and other authentication process that we have‚Äù.  You might call it security purpose or the fact the employers want to know the religion of the domestic help. We display the religion of the domestic help and its upto the employers mindset to select or reject the maid. Having said that, we have taken the feedback of a lot of users and we are considering removing it from the site if it hurts anyones sentiments. BOOKMYBAI.COM HAS NEVER AND WILL NEVER DISCRIMINATE ANYONE ON THE BASIS OF CASTE/RELIGION/COLOR/RACE/NATIVE PLACE. It makes no sense for us to do that. We make money only after a maid is placed and I believe everyone is aware that there is a short-supply of maids. Just rejecting someone because he/she is of some other religion makes no sense at all since it reduces our database capacity.

I hope this clarification brings an end to this thread which is trying to defame a company/startup which has always tried to help the underprivileged domestic workers by giving them an opportunity to earn better livelihood and not be exploited by the local maid agencies. 

We as a company provide provident fund, ESIC, Medical Insurance and tons of other benefits to the domestic helpers employed through us. No other local maid agency does that. All they do is exploit the maids since the maids have no choice. I personally believe that a service like this is the need of the hour not only for the employers but also for the domestic helps who get exploited everyday.

This mission of helping them can only be successful if we all work together.

Thanks

Anupam Sinhal Quality research - quality post!  Well done, mate !! Pointed Testimonial page as a reply to the owner, instead of replying, he removed the page. Anyways, it had another Gauri Desai with different pic and testimonial. Definitely fake one.

Here is the screenshot of the cached copy: http://imgur.com/ExPkrk5 So even [russsh.com](http://russsh.com/) to whom Get my Peon redirects uses stock pictures in their testimonials like [this one](http://imgur.com/QIehhOc) which is popular on sites like [123rf](http://www.123rf.com/photo_14010939.html) Come on, this is [known-tactic used by business](http://www.dailydot.com/business/steve-huffman-built-reddit-fake-accounts/). 

Nothing ""extra-ordinary"" about this. Came across the site from that other Reddit post. Aside from the fake testimonials etc., it is also sad to see that they blatantly use religion as one of the filters for selecting the maid. (http://www.bookmybai.com/hire-muslim-maid-and-baby-sitter-in-goregaon-in-mumbai). I understand that it may be a reality that families look at religion as a factor for selecting their maids but can we at least start to look beyond 
such obvious discriminations in the society instead of accepting and promoting them. Really do you need to do even research to doubt the veracity of Testimonials ?? I don't believe reviews testimonials or anything. Its your website write whatever you want 99% would believe it. The name itself says a lot about this startup. ""Bookmybai"" are you serious? We are talking about humans here. It doesn't carry the same meaning as ""bookmyshow"".

They could have just copied the name from GoDaddy ads.  I had hoped you will expose the business, you have simply did investigation of website pictures. Yes, it's naive but plenty of companies do stock-photos. For a new company, it is difficult to get Testimonials. Buying from Fiverr just hides the lie, does't eliminate it.

So anyway, tell us how was Bai? How was services? Were rates good? Etc. It must be linked to an NGO.",Photography,2015-11-02 21:41:35
"Hi Reddit, I'm Raam Reddy and I'm here with Doron Tempert! Ask us anything :)",107,4mspo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4mspo1/hi_reddit_im_raam_reddy_and_im_here_with_doron/,149,"Verification: https://twitter.com/ThithiTheFilm/status/739403039589556224

Hi Reddit India, thanks a lot for inviting me for this AMA! A brief intro about myself: Thithi is my debut fiction feature film as director, and is currently playing in theatres across India. I am also the author of an English novel called ""It's Raining in Maya"". Before making Thithi I made twelve short films, and grew up writing poetry and pursuing photography. I am thrilled to be here with my filmmaking soul-mate in many ways; the DoP for THITHI, the amazingly multi-talented filmmaker from Holland, Doron Tempert. Looking forward to chatting with you all; ask us anything! 

Hey everyone, thanks for making this such an amazing AMA, and thank you Reddit India for having us. It was very stimulating for the both of us, and is getting us more excited about our future work. Signing off with the reminder that Thithi is playing in theatres all over Karnataka and in Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Chennai! We're hoping to come to other cities in the coming week. Please try and catch it on the big screen before it leaves theatres, the experience leads to a far more immersive willing suspension of disbelief :) Thanks again hope you all have a great night!",raam_reddy," 1. Did you pay the villagers in your movie or plan to, at industry grades, now that you're seeing a wider release? Please give Gadappa a bonus :)

2. Have you started or do you have a plan for your next project? Are you working again with Ere Gowda? What is he working on next?

3. Do sheep farmers who migrate 400 km actually exist, like you've shown in your film?

4. How did Kiran Rao reach out to you? How did you get their attention? How helpful has Aamir Khan's support been?

5. Doron, I liked your shots of Gadapa walking aimlessly. Felt it was beautifully captured.

Thanks for doing this AMA! Good to see neo-realism in kannada.

Who is your favorite director?

Top 5 favourite movies (no language specific)? Hi Raam, 

I am curious to know the response of the villagers of Nodekopplu after the screening of the film. What did they think of your representation of them? 

Thanks Raam when are we going to see your film in theaters in tier II cities in the middle of the country or do you have plans to release it digitally, if so when.  Hey Raam! Me and my friend met you after the premier at BIFFES. You probably don't remember. I did tell you that I'd do my best to get the word out about Thithi..about how awesome it is. I've made at least a 100 people watch it and have posted about it everywhere including [here!](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4i5pky/if_youre_in_karnataka_go_out_and_watch_the/) Thanks for making such a wonderful movie. Kudos to Ere Gowda for the brilliant script. Please make more Kannada movies like Thithi.

Heads up - The movie is out on Torrentz(Floating around in my office as well!). People abroad and in tier 2 cities are interested in watching it. Why not release it on Youtube for pay-per-view? Hey Raam! My mom loved Thithi, since she is from that same part of Karnataka. I wanted to know how difficult is it to make it as a director in today's time? Are you in talks with Netflix for distribution of your films?

Edit (18/3/17): Yes you were. :D How did you zero in on the lead ""actors"" of thithi? Was it interesting auditioning for the roles? What is your favorite book Hi Ram and Doron! I would like to ask Ram as to which movies and books inspired you to pursue filmmaking? Doron, please tell me influences as a cinematographer and how did still photography helped you in this profession? How much money are you expected to make from this ? Hey Raam and Doron,

Firstly, congratulations on having continued success! I'm a movie buff, originally from Bangalore (grew up watching Kannada, Tamil, Hindi and world movies) and now in NY. I feel very sad that I am not there to witness the rebirth of the golden era of Kannada cinema. I have lofty hopes for teams like yours, Hemanth's (GBSM), etc. 

How do you think the Kannada audience and film making has changed since the Shankarnag era? 

Also, Doron - Is there any other contemporary Kannada movie you have watched and appreciated?

 Hi Ram, welcome to r/India. Thank you so much for doing this AMA. 
I'm probably one of the few who absolutely disliked Tithi. 

Let me explain, I'm a native kannada speaker, brought up in Mysore- about 35km from Mandya district where the movie is based. 

The lines that your characters were speaking seemed utterly forced, so there was no chance for the narration to get immersive, for all we could focus on was - why the heck are they speaking like this? 

SPOILERS AHEAD:
Your plot wouldn't exist as the entire story comes unhinged - all Gaddappa has to do is place a thumb impression on a paper - this everyone knows. 

The editing failed completely during Gaddappa's long monologue telling his may-not-be-true story of his father having sex with his wife and him finding out. Yes, it works brilliantly with subtitles but for a native speaker it was jarring, unnatural and wondered how people liked this. 

I understand it's not commercial cinema and we can't have the same expectations but you have a long way to go :)

Your story leaves many arcs incomplete: the money lender lady simply walks away, young Abhi gets to have sex with the sheperdess and we know for sure he's not going to bother ""finding her and marrying her"" and finally there is no retribution for the family honor as everyone is happily enjoying the meal at the end.

My question to you is, when, according to your Facebook post - when Francis Ford Coppola supposedly remarked to you that he wanted to be like Century Gowda, did you ask him what did he like about a 100 year old who dies in the first 3 minutes and the only back story we get is about his womanizing and traumatising his son by marrying his mistress to him? :)

Thanks again! What would be your advice to someone who wants to become a filmmaker? 

Who are the artists you look up to?  Hi Raam and Doron. What (films/directors) are your most important influences? 

If you don't want to answer that (I can understand :) ), could you name 3 films that you would want a film student to watch? Thanks!

Brilliant film by the way. I am a native Kannada speaker, and hail from a village (quite far from Mandya though) and I especially liked how you've captured the absurdity that one can find in rural India. Hi Raam teddy, excites to see Thithi movie, can you please release the movie in Taiwan with traditional Chinese subtitles?  I watched Thithi yesterday and it was masterful! It evoked Wes Anderson or Malgudi Days but it was told in a very convincing, original language. My question:

Marketing and distribution are the major bottlenecks for independent filmmakers and generally carve out the biggest slices from the budget pie. How did you market this film? Did you have guardian angels in this regard or help from unexpected quarters? Did you sweat about this much? Is Thithi releasing in hindi too ??
 Hi Raam,
It's been really great to see neo-realistic films in Kannada being appreciated and accepted by people so much. Congrats about that! My question is where can I watch it online? I am in UK and I have been meaning to watch the film since it's release. Are there any websites where I could pay and watch the movie?  Has the response to ""Thithi"" from rural area audiences been different from that of multiplex audiences? I'm assuming it's only the latter going all gaga about the real treatment and story telling... Man sad that it isn't being screened in my city - Raipur . I loved the trailer :)

* Do you think regional films dubbed in hindi/english have a wide audience now or  some years later . Bollywood isn't giving good stories 
* Is the average mall going crowd appreciating your film . Recently Sairat director said - i want to make good films which large audience would watch . Do you have the same view 
* Have you seen Court . What you feel about it ?

 Firstly, great job with the movie. The promos looked great and the reviews seem to suggest that the movie has lived up to it's hype.

Secondly, how does one watch this movie abroad? Do you plan to release this online at some point of time in the near future? Whats your take on College Film Festivals? Are you looking forward to showcase your movie after it has had its run? can you guys upload the making or behind the scene of THITHI...!! I am very much curious to see that..!! Which books should be read by every filmmaker? Are you afraid of losing out on your creativity if you are told to do a ""Big Budget Film""? Will Thithi have subtitles if I go see it in Bengaluru?

My kannada is weak and I don't want to be lost in the theatre. One more question from me:

Neeraj Ghaywan director of Masaan had said this in his AMA when asked what he thought 'is the most underrated task in filmmaking' -

> [Subtitling. People ignore it thinking it is just translation. It is actually as important as screenwriting because you need to give the right context to your dialogue, it should be a great and accurate adaption of your dialogue.

Your thoughts? Do you think regional language films especially in Kannada and Marathi are seeing a renaissance of sorts? Or have smart movies always been made in these languages and the audience hadn't paid attention earlier? when is it releasing overseas?  and on netflix? Raam, your favorite Iranian movies?

Edit: had seen a video of you talking about Iranian cinema. Hope you become trend setters in Kannada and Indian cinema!!

Where can I watch your short films? Hello, 

What is your biggest fears in life? Did you get past them, if so how? 

Also.. This is a general question. Don't mean to be weird about it at all.. Are.. Are both of you single? I'm asking for a ""friend"" ;) 

Sincerely
Walkingtaco22  how did you made these characters to be so natural....because these people are not actors...even the supporting characters were so real on camera...!!! i am so amused to see that...!  Did you incorporate the caste dynamics in the villages? I have not yet seen the film and would surely catch it soon.  [deleted] Hi Ram and Doron!  
Thanks for the AMA  

Individually to both, how do you cimena for yourself in the long run - in the point of sustenance?

Most of the amazing films in kannada, never come out to other parts of the country(haven't heard much before moving to mysore), any comments   Hi /u/raam_reddy and /u/dorontempert,
 I watched the movie quiet recently and I loved it. 
I was wondering, when Gadappa finished his narration to Shepherds, he finishes by saying it might be the truth or a dream. And the shepherds resign by mumbling in kannada, we thought it was truth. But this mumbling was not in subtitle. Was it intentional?
 Hi raam.. Why did you choose kannada over telugu for this movie? 

Any particular reasons?  Namaskara Raam,

""nanghe kannada barud illa""so are you planning to release your movie in Hindi (dubbed version)?

Edit: I don't like watching subtitled movies. * what is your next project..?
* how can someone approach you to be your assistant for the next project...? [deleted] It's Raining in Maya.
Do you understand Maya? is it illusion? define your concept of maya.  Hey Raam,

1. How much does the script influence on the language of the movie? Do you plan to create more Kannada movies in the future?
2. When do you expect the international release to happen? I'm too eager to watch this film, that i don't mind watching a pirated version. Is it ok? Or else hurry up :)
3. How did your collaboration with Doron happen? I see more film makers taking the international route with their DOPs and i see significant leap in the quality as well. Is there a correlation?

Thanks and Cheers.. Hello Thithi team:

I haven't caught up with your movie yet as I am abroad, but I am excited to see this movie getting the praise. 

Did you experience any difficulty getting the certification for the movie from CBFC? 

I am a part of Save our cinema campaign to fight against censorship in movies and I know that CBFC Karnataka has refused to classify a lot of films set in rural settings because they didn't like the language/accent of the characters.  @raam - please shed some light on your pre production and post production process. 

@Doron - how did you break the language barrier? Before edit how big was footage dump? How long did you take to prepare for shoot and what process did you follow?

@Both - how did you convince the shepherds to be part of filming.  I have an iPhone6 and decent video editing skills. What can I do with it? Congratulations on your success guys. Here's to hoping more! *clinks*

I have a rather silly question that's been eating my head :)

Shouldn't the characters' names be transliterated as 'GaDDappa' and 'ThaMManna' as opposed to 'Gadappa' and 'Tamanna' ? It occurred to me when reading the subtitles. I kind of vaguely got the feeling that the names were pronounced 'Gadappa' and 'Tamanna' in the movie too. 

Cheers

Edit: Grammar Saw the movie last weekend. Just wanted to say that you and your team have bought the plot together brilliantly. Loved the work. Thanks for the good time! :) Raam

Why do you think the mainstream (popular) Kannada film industry is so inferior to the films of the other three southern states?

I'm not talking about the ""elite"" niche slice of cinema, like ""Cyanide"", Prakash Belawadi films etc. I meant more, why don't we ever have a Mani Ratnam, Kamal Hassan or Rajnikant? Why are we stuck with the Raj Kumars? Rama - how comfortable are you with Kannada? I'm assume your primary languages are English and Telugu, given your name and that you grew up in the richer parts of Bangalore. How did thought of making 'Thithi' crossed your mind ?

Was it any one particular event/moment or just something which gradually built up in your mind and you decided to go for it after lot of thinking ?",Photography,2016-06-06 20:39:11

[askindia] Am I really thinking wild? Confused. [career help],19,7gdwwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7gdwwd/askindia_am_i_really_thinking_wild_confused/,7,"I'm a 27 guy and currently working in a hectic job in a small town away from a big city with no like minded people around me or even friends to hang out. I'm stressed and with a lot of thoughts in my mind. One thought/idea ain't letting me sleep these days. I want to start a photography based business in a nearby big city. I've been in love for photography but since I've started working, I hardly get time. Don't have any like minded people around me, or even if, can't give much time. I've had a small business earlier which was unsuccessful but learnt a lot during college time. Now working for a year has got me a hang of how to deal with people, manage them, get results. 

Now coming back to my idea of photography and filmmaking business, it ain't any disruptive business but something I've loved. I have a small portfolio which ain't much impressive, not of any models in the photos but general landscape, street and travel. I don't intend to be the next fashion photographer either. So the idea is leave this work, get to the nearby city, start a photography firm with initially teaching the basics and advance of photography, not the costly ones but even college students which can afford. Side by side, also lectures from the well knowns in the field who might help me get some traction along with what I've been doing. I plan to get some amount of initial money from home for this. Pick up a few students, with some contacts, get some photography paid jobs. Get those students paid with some margin for me, get more contacts and  follow it up. The jobs I tend to initially get are concerts, photoshoots and even weddings. Photography instruments and cameras can be rented. A lot of things I feel I can do. 

But now the only fear is jumping out of my well paying hectic job at this age for something like this. How much harm will it do to my career if I fail out and if I want to go back to my work life again? How do I see the future when this field is jam packed with every photographer and film maker out there. I don't plan to bring anything different in photography but satisfied clients, good photographs and create a team which can deliver this with me. This all as happiness in what I will do and something belonging to me. 

I also thought of doing this after trying out for mba, as it might give me a cushion. Maybe help me out. But again confusing.

So how wild is this? I need some sane suggestions here, haven't asked my family or friends. 

I've not edited any part of this text, just raw, straight out of my confused mind. Please be gentle, already stressed and confused about all directions in career.

tl;dr: 27yo guy, hectic job, wants to leave for starting a photography business with not much experience and not a disruptive business but something just for happiness. Confused guy.",shitheadchad," My suggestion

Start a Facebook page, Instagram page and a 500px page. Keep posting your BEST photos. The photos should inspire people and make them wonder how it was shot. If you are into videography, then make some short-films and post it in youtube as well.

Then, keep doing it for a while, maybe for an year as part-time. Once you have enough followers and is popular enough, you will have sufficient reputation that people will be willing to pay good money to learn from you, and also people will start buying your photos. What is that hectic job you do? ",Photography,2017-11-29 23:09:49

So, Let's discuss.

**Should you buy a new laptop now or wait?**

If you are on a budget between 30k & 50k and can wait for 4+months then I suggest waiting as eighth generation Intel processors will be out. It is said to be having upto 50% better performance in the U-series processors which are usually found on laptops in this budget range.

If you want a high budget high-performance laptop, then I suggest buying from US and getting some relative to bring it for you. This will save you a LOT of money and will give you better choice.

If you want a high-end gaming laptop - You can either buy now or wait for 6+months for Ryzen processors to be out for laptops. 8th gen processors may give more cores too, but wouldn't affect gaming much. Nvidia is unlikely to upgrade their GPUs for at least a year, so now is a good time to buy.

**What to look for in a new laptop?**

1. Value for money specs. No point in buying an i3 for 50k.
2. Good Build Quality. Most budget laptops lack this, but still you can choose the better ones.
3. Good display as it is the most used component of the computer. At above 45k price range try to get only full HD display. It is sad that even today most laptops come with 720p display while low end phones with much smaller screens come with 1080p display.
4. Consider the one with a dedicated graphics card. (This is needed for heavy graphics intensive applications and gaming) [If you are not going to game, do video editing, or other such tasks then it might be optional for you]
5. Approx release date. Try to buy newer laptops.
6. If you are a heavy laptop user, then the additional warranties will help a lot.
7. Try to buy a laptop without a DVD bay. No one uses DVDs nowadays and it is a gross waste. It is an outdated tech but it takes a lot of space inside the laptop, so the designers of the laptop has to sacrifice something else - mostly battery size or cooling system. Instead, if you want DVD, then buy a USB dvd player for 1K. This might not be possible for below 50k laptops as sadly all laptops come with it, but for all expensive laptops, dont make the mistake of buying one with this obsolete drive.

**What NOT to look for.**

1. Do not look at Ram. Only check if additional Ram can be added in the future. Most Laptops have an extra slot where you can add Ram later.
2. Hard disk size - Nearly all laptops come with bad quality hard disk. You can upgrade it to an SSD in the future.
3. Don't assume the stuff you dont know. Processor clock speed, graphic card memory etc - Unless you are an expert, it is very difficult to comprehend the right information, for example, higher clock speed doesnt mean higher speed in all cases. Higher graphic memory doesnt mean anything. 

**All i7's are not faster than all i5s**. 

For example - i5 7300HQ will beat the shit out of i7 7500U because the second one is a processor designed for ultra power efficiency while the first one is designed for performance. 

The real world performance difference between  i7 7500U and i5 7200U is nearly zero but the price difference between laptops with each of these chips is over Rs10k. So, you basically handed over your money to intel because you were not knowledgeable enough about their tricky naming scheme. (*there is a tiny percentage difference, but not at all worth the money increase)

The real world performance difference between i5 7300HQ and i7 7700HQ are less than 5% on most tasks. Only software which can utilize the extra threads(video editors, virtual machines etc) of this i7 will have about 30% more performance. This improvement in performance is usually NOT worth it if you are on a budget as you wont be able to utilize it in most cases. It is like the difference between buying a 10 seater van and a 6 seater car, but you almost never have more than 4 passengers, so better save up and get that car

If I oversimplify, i5s are basically slightly lower performing i7 chips with hyperthreading tech disabled. It has same architecture and same everything as the i7, but since it was not performing as much as i7, intel decided to sell it as i5. 

It is recommended to ask a tech expert about these stuff, especially about the processor model number and graphics card. 

**Whichever laptop you buy, you will have to upgrade your laptop later with the following components**

1. **RAM** - Many laptops come with 4GB ram, but it is advised to upgrade it by buying an additional 4 or 8 GB ram which would cost around Rs3000. You don't really need more than 8GB unless you are doing specialized stuff like video editing.
2. **SSD** - This is a new faster hard disk. It is a must-have for speedy laptops. It costs around Rs7000. It is a must have, because it will make everything like 400% faster. I suggest to replace the DVD drive with the existing hdd, and put ssd in the internal bay. If you are the lucky few who don't have the dvd bay, then either replace internal hdd or look to buy laptops with pcie based internal ports which support NVME SSDs. Most common laptops doesnt come with this port and you will have to use the older SATA connector. 

**Speed difference-**

* Normal hard disk - 80MBps
* Sata SSD - 500MBps (Good for nearly everything)
* NVMe PCIE SSD - 4000MBps (Slightly better(because most people won't be utilizing that whole speed except when copy-pasting stuff or loading games or heavy apps), but if you are buying a new laptop above 80k then try to get one with this one.Dont buy it if you have to pay a premium for this, as the real world speed difference will be like 20%) 

Regarding good deals - I bought [Acer Predator Helios 300](https://www.flipkart.com/acer-predator-helios-300-core-i5-7th-gen-8-gb-1-tb-hdd-128-gb-ssd-windows-10-home-4-graphics-g3-572-gaming-laptop/p/itmewggdy7uasfhh?pid=COMEWGGDGQDDSGPD&srno=s_1_1&otracker=search&lid=LSTCOMEWGGDGQDDSGPDTEZG5J&fm=SEARCH&iid=ff62873c-4a31-449d-ae30-f94d4d7ed957.COMEWGGDGQDDSGPD.SEARCH&qH=e01f2311eb834a15) for 49.9K from Flipkart. That is a laptop worth over a lakh in India. So, there are some good deals out there, just that you need to be vigilant about it.

Indian multimedia is horrendous.,101,560z3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/560z3n/indian_multimedia_is_horrendous/,40,"So I'm part of an multimedia help group. We volunteer, helping people from all over the world with various software, but mostly Photoshop. People will post their images or animations and ask for help or feedback which we assist with. 

Now I've been doing this for more than 8 years and I'm educated in art and multimedia design, and classically trained in print advertising. I'm also a graphic designer. So I know what I'm doing and I know what I'm talking about, as do the other volunteers. 

Now, India. Whenever we get an upload from India it's almost always a case of the following:

1. The work is terrible. Over use of vignette, blur, exposure, saturation. 
2. It's a ridiculous portrait. For example, some guy sitting on the roof of a Ferrari. 
3. It's almost always men of various ages working on images of themselves. Really over-acted poses and stares. Just, shit really, no matter how it's analysed. 
4. Despite the fact that it's a helping forum with clear instructions to post AND ask your questions, Indian work is NEVER posted up with any questions. It's just posted and left like, *""Look at my awesome work!""*

Now I'm not biased or racist or generalising and if you think I am, I couldn't give a shit. This is based on 8 years of experience and the simple, statistical reality of almost all posts that come in to our site from India. No other country's people act this way on our site. Every one else mostly posts reasonably good work of general artistic topics and asks for help on some level. Not Indians. It's always vain, childish trash that none of us volunteers can even begin to understand, and when we offer feedback (which is usually not positive but always polite) we meet incredible resistance. Like how dare we critique work and offer suggestions to work that is posted to our free art critiquing website? It's not a gallery. It's a help and critique site made very clear by all the comments and critique publicly displayed, **as well as** the rules stated upon posting. 

Even if you look at our collective ban list right now. 248 people banned in 8 years. 233 of them registered as being from India. 

So what's up with this, India? How do I better understand what's going on here? How do I help you to help yourselves? Why is your art and photography so self-centred, vain, and forgive me, just plain terrible, and why won't you listen to **free**, professional advice on a free, professional advice website that **you came to**?",Art3sian," > How do I help you to help yourselves?

If I were a member of your forum, i would personally really appreciate the following:

- A wiki with a clear end-to-end workflow or flowchart of common boilerplate practices / environment setup.

- A section with examples of ""Good"" photos vs ""Bad"" photos.

- Then you could point the newbies to the mandatory wiki reading first (optional I've read through the wiki check box at the bottom before their membership is promoted from newbie to regular member)

These measures set up the expectations in the mind of new members. [deleted] >It's a ridiculous portrait. For example, some guy sitting on the roof of a Ferrari.

Oh dear. This is what fuels IPFB. It's cringeworthy as fuck but you know, people do whatever they like.

Why is this happening to your site? I guess you are being too accommodating to these guys. Simply kick them out. Unless you feel a work deserves your attention, remove it. Just because you volunteer, doesn't mean you need to put up with crap like this. Set up some rules. Once they realize, they will leave.

What is your site btw? [deleted]  
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3040 
 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/63034) There was/is (?) a fad going on where every single person became a photographer and started their own editing companies called awE$0m3 eDitzzZz. So cringy.  These are inspired by trying to emulate the over the top, ridiculous ways in which the hero in portrayed Indian cinema. As everyone wants, these guys want others think highly of them. But they don't realize what may be suitable to heroes in movies is not suitable for others. And our shit doesn't smell type of thinking.

If you are Indian, you must know the ridiculous amount of time people spend taking and editing their photos. Most won't use Photoshop and even if they use, they use only the told which require a low curve of learning. Many look for ready made filters they can run their photo through or pictures in which they replace subjects with themselves. By definition, good artists are not common. Then I guess many of those users you are taking about might be the type of people who get featured on Indian people Facebook subreddit. If you are Indian, you know the ridiculous amount of told people spend taking photos of themselves and editing them in an amateur way. Now their perceptions of art are affected mostly by the movie industry. And Indian movie industry ridiculous in portraying the heroes in films in ridiculously grand ways. People may want to emulate that and as with everybody, our shit doesn't smell. 100% accurate. I'm a third year product design student and I visited the offices of the designers at one of the biggest fmcg companies in the country. They had people represented through stick figures, for fucks sake.

its the education primarily that's at fault. give it 10 years or so, I guess Not defending anything, just trying to explore possible root cause of such behaviour.

> The work is terrible. Over use of vignette, blur, exposure, saturation. 

A very common newbie mistake, newbies look for something easy that makes an impact, rather than getting comfortable with tools first and creating something. Also these filters are the first thing that pops up in mobile editing apps, some EXIF data might indicate if the photos were taken using a camera phone or DSLR.

> It's almost always men of various ages working on images of themselves. Really over-acted poses and stares. Just, shit really, no matter how it's analyzed.

- Newbies by definition are terrible.

- Easiest available human model is oneself right?

- Women in general are much less likely to do something publicly that has a potential for embarrassment (experimental pictures)

> Despite the fact that it's a helping forum with clear instructions to post AND ask your questions, Indian work is NEVER posted up with any questions. It's just posted and left like, ""Look at my awesome work!""

Probably something to do with male ego and not wanting to appear weak/inexperienced.

Also with the rapid increase in availability of multimedia devices at an increasingly more affordable price points, a lot more photography newbies have been created. I have no idea why you are posting on a specific country page because of problems with users of your so-called professional website. Just enforce standards for user behaviour, and ban them if they don't conform to those standards. **Job done**. Why does it matter what country the uploader comes from?

Now if you were really trying to understand something like cultural factors behind this sort of behaviour (and were treating it as a user experience problem), you wouldn't have used like ""vain, childish trash"", and ""I couldn't give a shit"". The fact that you are, shows that you are looking for someone to ego massage you by going ""Oh yeah ‚Äì about that; we are sorry for all the assholes from India. Please, please, forgive those of us that are good!""

I suggest you seek this validation somewhere else. I hear that making toilet jokes about India works well on Reddit. > Your art
> Your photography

You're making a generalization based on the subset of designers that come to your site. I suggest you visit any reputed Indian ad agency or production house to get a feel for the state of *professional* design in this country. I do not find them lacking in the way you describe it, but perhaps they catch on to global design trends a little later.

Otherwise, I'd say the kind of people who post as described are probably new to technology or in environments where it is seen as magical. For a person who could never dream of being photographed near a ferrari, Photoshop gives them a thrill. It may seem kitsch to us.
I do not know why they are arrogant. I will give you that - as a people we have the highest ego per unit of achievement (Narayana Murthy quote).  r/indianpeoplefacebook  That's just your confirmation bias on your part.If you have encountered several terrible american or french designers you wouldn't call all american, french artists as shallow, vain and pathetic.

But since they were Indians,you are more likely to be biased against them(I'm guessing aussies have a history of being bigots).After analysing your entire rant, you seem like a racist prick.
And how is posting here going to help you with your assignment? Better filter out the bad ones rather than whinging here. I fail to understand the point of your winding rant in this sub Do you expect us to bow down before you and apologise for the sins of Indians who are not obsequious enough on your forum? Perhaps you do not have the temperament to be a volunteer. A little humility and compassion would go a long way.

And before dismissing all Indian multimedia as horrendous, perhaps you put some effort to find work done by other Indians and Indian companies in this field. Whatever, don't bitch about it. If you're sick of the questions/requests, just ignore.

If I were you, I'd see this for what it is - a business opportunity. So many people want exactly the same thing, an over the top photoshop of them with ferraris. Just make some awesome stock templates and sell them. Don't come here with your cultural complaints chutiyapa.",Photography,2016-10-06 02:27:40
21 (F) Backpacking India solo in October! Seeking advice/tips!,37,4uu5hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4uu5hv/21_f_backpacking_india_solo_in_october_seeking/,68,"Hey Guys! Firstly, all my flights are booked. This isn't a ""is it safe"" thread :) I am well aware of the dangers and scams. I have done and am doing my research. I know what to wear etc. Thanks for your concern!



I'm flying into New Delhi on the 19th of October, staying for one night then probably heading off to Jaipur the next day. I would rather avoid going to Agra, and want to get out of Delhi ASAP so i'm going to skip the Taj/Save it for next time.




Im hoping to head to Pushkar after that, and then off to Udaipur and Jodhpur, after that I have no sort of sense of where to go next. I want to go in the general direction of the south (Goa, Kerala etc.) I'm hoping to spend 3-4 months travelling around. I should have $2000-2500 AUD to spend (100,488 - 125,606 Rupees) maybe even more. Any advice on time I should spend in certain cities etc. would be greatly appreciated. Im really into photography and video. Really keen on going to markets, trying lots of food, buying clothes, seeing some awesome architecture etc.



Would like some recommendations on: - Doing classes, yoga, massage, cooking etc. where to do them - Buying clothes, places to avoid or places to 'save space' for - Activities (like camel ride in Jaisalmer, which I probably wont be doing this time)



I want to know how to go about money; Should I get out a large amount before I go? Use my card? Are there many ATM's around? Whats a good system to have to avoid getting my money stolen.



Any other advice or anything would be cool. Also if you're going to be in Rajasthan around the same time let me know!

I've also posted this in /r/backpacking ",SilkyWizard," I know this isn't a ""is it safe"" thread, but let me still point one thing out.

You're budgeting 120,000 bucks for 120 days. That's 1000 per day. This will include travel, food, stay, sightseeing etc. Not impossible, but with the quality you'll be getting, safety is going to be a major concern. Your budget should at least be 3 times that for a comfortable and safe journey. I would recommend a companion, India broadly is safe, but it still won't hurt to use the buddy system.

As to the money bit, others recommended ATM cards, but keep one thing in mind, Visa / Master charge a fucking arm and a leg for every withdrawal. Withdrawal fees alone would be $ 1 minimum (check with your bank though, YMMV as per the bank) + they have horrible currency conversion rates, you will lose a fair sum of money just due to these fees.

I am not sure if foreigners can open bank accounts, but opening a bank account locally and wiring your money in would be the best bet.

As to the where and what, I would suggest the South. You could visit Goa, Mangalore, Hampi (an absolute must see, and it is also a party destination for backpackers, mostly Israelis and Germans from  what I have seen), Badami, get into Kerala, do a house boat tour, Munnar / Thekkady (wildlife reserves, that are absolutely gorgeous in October-Feb), maybe move into the highlands, Ooty (not very crowded during this period, so it is good), Pondicherry (the Aurobindo Ashram here is a good place to get your Yoga, Massage fix, and one more popular stop for tourists), Arakamedu ( an ancient port town), Mahabalipuram and then move into Andhra or move back to Karnataka and end the tour in Bangalore.

edit [Turns out, you can open a bank account](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=30).

I would strongly recommend you to do this, this will save you a fortune in bank charges.  

* Open bank account
* Wire money
* Withdraw in rupees
* Profit?


Many metros and tier 1 and even tier 2 cities have Uber or Ola, use them, they are cheap, safe and reliable. Hey, don't have too much cash with you. If it is for small things, I ask you to have a maximum of 500 INR in cash with you. 10 rupee notes, 50 rupee notes, and 100 rupee notes. Because you'll be needing these from time to time if you travel by rickshaws and such or have a plan to eat paanipuri and such things. Preferably, bra is the best place for little amount of cash. Might seem odd, but it is the safest safe according to Indian women.

ATMs are available in plenty pretty much everywhere so that won't be a problem. You can ask for them or track them on GPS.

You have done a lot of research, good! I hope you have some fellow redditor accompanying you in each state that you travel. 

What classes other than yoga and cooking will you be opting for? Mehendi? Rangoli? I believe you are in for a great plan and you'll be knowing more of Indian culture than most of us here do. 

Good luck for your journey! May you have some best moments of your life in India. It seems you have done your research sincerely. 

ATMs available in all cities and most towns. 

Pick pocketing is common at all stations(rail/road). These places tend to be overly crowded.

Do not accept unpackaged food from strangers while in transit.

Local women keep their money/valuables stashed securely under their bra.

Ask politely and most would help with anything.

Enjoy your Travels. op i would like to point out that you should increase your budget, take care of your hygiene i dont know about other state but in Punjab their is viral,typhoid and malaria on rise.Drink bottled water only (of good brands). Firstly as your period of stay is quite long and you have an appropriate budget for the same, consider opening a bank account [NRO account](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=30), here's some info and you can search more about it. Some prominent banks in India are SBI, ICICI, HDFC, etc

> Foreign tourists during their short visit to India can open a Non-Resident (Ordinary) Rupee (NRO) account (Current / Savings) with any Authorised Dealer bank dealing in foreign exchange. Such account can be opened up to a maximum period of 6 months.

> Passports and other valid identification proofs are required for opening the accounts. Authorised Dealer banks are also required to follow the Know Your Customer norms while opening the accounts.

As for money, the general advice of keeping your money compartmentalised (not having all money in a single place) applies. Emergency cash as suggested by others is best suited to be kept in a bra, Some in carry on and some in the hotel. ATMs are plenty and can be found in most of the places.

Buy an Indian Mobile SIM. Airtel (best coverage), Vodafone, BSNL (public sector so coverage is better in remote places) are your best choices. It's also helpful for registering for various things.

Don't try to hire an auto-rickshaw, cab on the go without using an app (in detail later) as many of them will try to overcharge you

As you're coming on the 19th of October, I would suggest for you to be in Jaipur or any other big City on 30th October which is a day of celebration as its Diwali (one the widely celebrated festival of India, with loads of fireworks, sweets,etc).

Go ethnic (Food, shopping) in everything except the place to stay.

I would like to suggest to add Rishikesh, Ranthambore - Sariska, to your bucket list.
Actually, there are so many things to see in Rajasthan itself to last you the full trip. Going to Goa for New Year celebration/Christmas while maybe expensive (peak season) is a great experience, you may be able to reduce the costs by living in not many popular places which the locals know about

Smartphone Apps are your best friend here:
For hotels: Make My trip, Trip adviser (for the well-known hotels), Oyo Hotels (for lesser known but with great price)
For Cab: Ola, Uber (for AC taxies/cabs with 10-11Rs/km) and Jugnoo (for app base auto rickshaws, incredibly cheap, 5-6 Rs for a kilometer)
[Note: There is a special feature (kind of emergency button) for safety in these apps]
Google (on Android at least) is a great help, It automatically shows you nearby places and stuff
Tip: Register on these apps using Indian number even if the app is used internationally like Uber to enjoy the best price possible, in most cases sometimes Indian number is necessary

I live in Jaipur, Rajasthan and feel free to AMA about the Rajasthan leg of your trip.

COBRA GYPSIES - full documentary

it was done by a backpacker and he did a very good job


also go to Kerala if you can...see the beaches, rice paddies, and tea estates... Couchsurfing? [removed] I recommend carrying a power bank for your phone.
Most places only accept cash but there are atms also available i recommend getting a local rupee card in order to avoid cross currency charge.
For example http://www.axisbank.com/personal/forex/india-travel-card/features-benefits.aspx In udaipur, there are a lot of quaint little coffee shops and restaurants by the lake. Just a grab a book and pick a spot. Drink beer out of a tea pot. Walk around the old city aimlessly (i do that myself time to time and I live here). There are day trips you can take to ranakpur, kumbalgarh where there is a lot of history. Karni mata temple for a panoramic view of the lakes and the city. Eklingji temple. Shopping is not very expensive here if you go with the locals. Best way to get around is rickshaw or foot. If you have any questions or concerns, I'll be more than happy to help I will be in Rajasthan around the same time. Just letting you know. I think you're making a mistake by staying just one day in New Delhi and skipping Agra. These are the two most historical cities in North India. Rajasthan is great but it doesn't come close to these two. 

Sure, I agree they are filthy at shit, every second person you talk to there is going to try and scam you and they are filled with tourists and tourist traps, expensive compared to the rest of India and thousands of other negatives including safety. But you signed up for the full experience so why not go and get it?

New Delhi is a city of ruins spanning two millenniums - you can't ever get tired of exploring it. Wake up early and go to Taj Mahal at sunrise and I promise it will change your life forever. Go to Fatehpur Sikri, an abandoned historical city near Agra. And thats scratching the surface.

Skip Goa - its just a bunch of beaches with cheap beer. You'll probably get bored of it within minutes compared to the Gold Coast beaches. Please visit south India, you'll be much more safer and have a good experience compared to north. Don't have any advice specific to what you asked, but do also try these:

http://www.indiamike.com/

http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/forum

https://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/forums/asia-indian-subcontinent

Much larger and travel focused communities. Hi, others have given great suggestions here. I will suggest these based on my own experiences:

Delhi:

1. Architecture: Qutab Minar, Humayan's Tomb

2. Temples: Akshardham, Iskcon, Lotus Temple (choose any two)

3. Party Circuit: Hauz Khas (lots of expats)

4. Food: Old Delhi specialties for traditional Indian foods, Hauz Khas for modern delights.


Agra/Fatehpur Sikri:

1. Agra Fort (really liked it) and Taj Mahal 

2. Fatehpur Sikri Fort (beautiful)

Avoid: 

1. Buying artifacts, handicraft items from street sellers (unless someone is accompanying you.)

2. Red Fort, Delhi: Too Crowded and not maintained properly (personal opinion)

------

Jaipur: I live here presently so I can pinpoint to places you should see:

1. Amer Fort (must), Jaigarh Fort (if you have the time), Hawa Mahal (looks basic from outside but beautiful from the inside), City Palace, Jantar Mantar, Birla Temple & Ganesh Temple (side by side), Chokhi Dhani (never been here)

2. Food: LMB

3. Nearby: Ranthambore, wildlife and a centuries old template on top of a fort

Ajmer: 

1. Ajmer Sharif Dargah (very crowded, so watch out)

2. Avoid the Ajmer Fort as it's just a museum.


Pushkar: Quiet little place with the Ghats and the Brahma Temple being the most impressive. I have been here only twice so not able to offer more advice. But you will like it here, so plan a extended/flexible stay.

Further: 

Udaipur - visit the forts, lake, a memorial or park, Nathdwara and also a very old but still well maintained Temple beautifully crafted from the mountains (don't remember the name!). Also checkout Kumbhalgarh and Ranakpur which are nearby.

Mount Abu - Jain Temples, lake (nothing significant on offer except natural scenery apart from these)

Jodhpur and Jaisalmer - Visited long ago and don't remember much now except the Forts/Desert Rides.

May Also Try:
Bikaner - Fort and famous for Sweets/Food
Deshnok - Temple with thousands of rats roaming free.

I have only explored the Northern parts of India so don't have enough experience to suggest more about the Southern part which you are keen to explore. 


General Tips:

1. Keep a chain to lock your backpack while travelling so it's not stolen while you are asleep. I have also seen a netted cover protection which you can bring along.

2. Powerbank

3. Inflatable Pillow

4. Light Sheets to cover yourself at night.

5. Mosquito Repellent Cream (just in case) and a SPF cream.

6. Sandals/Flip Flops

7. Photocopies of all your identification/travel documents. Keep in separate location from originals. Also carry two ATM cards and keep them in separate locations.

8. Cash: As others have already suggested, carry less but small amounts. Keep excess emergency funds in backpack or some hidden location.

9. Waterproof Backpack (or a cover)

10. Write Down Common Emergency numbers (personal and government) in a paper and keep it handy in case of loss of phone.

11. First Aid Kit: (Band aid, medicine for common illness, cotton and an antiseptic cream). Also Carry Paper soap with you.

12. Avoid street food if not accompanied by friends.

13. Setup apps on your phone which help you locate it in case it gets stolen, not in hopes of recovery but at least you can lock/erase your data.


Activities: 

1. Yoga/Cooking and other Skill classes - many options. Enroll in classes in the city where you plan your maximum stay.

I hope I covered the initial part of your trip well with the limited travel experience I have. All of this is from personal experience so modify to suit your style. Have a nice stay. [deleted] You should start from the North then via Punjab (Amritsar etc) go to Rajasthan, maybe a trek to Kheerganga or some other hill station. Leh Ladakh is very nice, you are missing an entire scenic part of India.

 Don't carry large amounts of money but always carry some. ATM's are very common in cities. Rent a car. You can still do everything you wanted. But you will have a lot more freedom.

Hate to say this - but i don't know how you can be confident about your safety. You did your research, yes, but there are no standard safe practices for the entire India. 

Rent a car. Feel like walking or travelling by bus? You can still do that. Wish you a great trip.",Photography,2016-07-27 19:35:39
Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP],186,4i91ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4i91ig/kota_district_collectors_letter_to_the_parents_of/,40,"Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one‚Äôs child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child‚Ä¶ Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No‚Ä¶ They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children‚Ä¶ Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say ‚ÄúTip of the Iceberg‚Äù reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don‚Äôt mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts‚Ä¶ your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better‚Ä¶psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors‚Ä¶could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child‚Äô s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is‚Ä¶ Should parents go children√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted‚Ä¶ Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain‚Ä¶ Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful‚Ä¶In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying‚Ä¶ But there is a possibility of your child not liking you‚Ä¶ This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have‚Ä¶) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you‚Ä¶ I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo‚Ä¶

Children are parents‚Äô responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so‚Ä¶ Parents really think good for their children‚Äôs future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good‚Ä¶ what is successful‚Ä¶ what is the best thing‚Ä¶ Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of‚Ä¶

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in ‚ÄúRight Child Care Practices‚Äù and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case‚Ä¶Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise ‚ÄúYour‚Äù dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care‚Ä¶ Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times‚Ä¶Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child ‚Äúto be‚Äù on his own terms and here I mean especially the child‚Äôs engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the time√¢‚Ç¨¬¶. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise ‚ÄúYour Dreams‚Äù at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises ‚ÄúHis/Her‚Äù Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!
I am sure there is no competition there

Yours Sincerely,
Dr Ravi Kumar
District Collector, Kota",grasssrootz," I doubt that the parents he is targeting will read his letter and even if they read it I am sure they won't give a shit. This is embarrassing. All my life I've just heard 'Kota' and I had thought that was the name of the institute. And here I was, reading the letter wondering how the director of Kota is jeopardising his own institution.   Source? Or is this yet another what's app forward. Not bad, really well written appeal. It was much needed as sucide cases is on rise at kota. I'm glad my parents never wanted me to go to an IIT.  >Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth

[RANT] Reservation Quotas.,116,3afiny,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3afiny/rant_reservation_quotas/,129,"Everyday I wake up and regret being born in this country. I gave 3 competitive exams this year for different colleges. I was not selected in any of them. It's okay. I accept it.

Here's the part that grinds my gears. Reservation category. People getting selected on the basis of what their caste is  plain ridiculousness. Let me tell you these competitive exams were design aptitude and Film desgin (Specific area). I know a guy who got selected in a  college, he didn't even know what WHITE BALANCE in camera was until I told him (this was after 2 days of result declaration in which he was selected). The douche has Canon 5Dmark3. ""Photu me background blur ho raha hai, bc FB pe photography page kholo"" type dude. His father is super rich. Owns a jewelery shop.

Reservation quota does injustice with someone who knows better than the aforementioned prick. I am not saying I deserved that seat but.....fuck it man, this all just makes me super sad in general about India. 

Government sectors are not top notch as they should be because pile of reserved pricks got through who were only better taking bribes but nothing else. 

I am going to give entrance for FTII this year. In total 10 seats. In which 5 seats are reserved. Let's see how it goes for me. Considering the current situation at FTII with all the protests and all, this year too there will be no intake, a zero year. If this happens another slap to India's body of work. 2nd consecutive Zero year it will be in FTII.

EDIT:- NEW TO THIS SUB REDDIT. Didn't know this has been posted before also. Sorry for that. Anyway, sorry for the inconvenience. Kindly ignore or downvote the thread just for your satisfaction.

EDIT:- Hey, I also get the part where I didn't get the seat in unreserved category. I get it. I also accept it. But the 'whining like a little bitch' as some of you are calling is because of the stupid system. That prick with canon 5dmark3 didn't deserved that seat. Bas bc. He said ""jo photu me blur hota hai"" which is  ""SHadow depth of field"" makes me sad.

EDIT:- Adding extra point which is totally off topic but have surely done everything to bring my moral down. FUCKING RELATIVES. Fuck them all. I hope they die a painful death. 
",takemybody," Sorry that you regret being born in this country. But ensure that your children don't regret about their country. Expatriate yourself at the earliest opportunity. [](/knowthatfeel) - Get married

- Get H1 job

- Go to US and knock wife up

- Your child born in US.. automatic US citizenship for child.

- Come back to India.. work.

- Child grows up in India.. send him to US for studies.. 

- After graduation, child gets work, applies for your visa.. you get to US within a year.

- Enjoy US. [deleted] *Sigh*. How many times have people ranted about reservation in this subreddit and everytime same answer needs to be given.


There are millions of people living in this country who don't have the same opportunities as you do. The reservation is for *them*. Despite that they are backward is because they are mostly not aware of it. And the creamy layer needs to be enforced. The reservation is required in this country. Otherwise they have no hope... Off tangent to the topic at hand -- why is the conversation about quotas only when we are applying to colleges? Is it a matter of out of sight out of mind thing? 

I ran out ""fucks"" to give so I made my peace with it.  I was extremely lucky. I passed the entrance test and got a top college in Mumbai. Very well know. Got 333 rank. 

I get to college for admission and there I met a guy. We chatted a bit and he asked me how many questions I attempted.

 I said 113. He said he attempted 35. 

How the fuck did you got passed ?  

Answer - quota 

My face ¬∞_¬∞

Why don't we introduce a creamy layer. All the wrong guys are taking the quota.  And would you believe some people have the balls to question my flair. Un-fucking-believable people. I get it. Reservation sucks. Hard. Pendulous Donkey balls. Sure, I too understand, I too am condemned to lifelong drudgery of fighting for leftovers thrown at us unreserved folks. But frankly, I dont complain. I cant complain. Am sure our ancestors made the most of their superiority back in the days, at our expense. Life's not fair. Big whoop. You know what grinds my gears Peter Griffin? People suggesting you to move to 'le states'. If I were really pissed off about reservations; angry, frustrated about this awful unfair treatment as much as OP , I'd try to bring about a change in the system. Find ways bring reforms to legislature. Maybe even join the system to change the system. Someone has to get their hands dirty eventually. Emigrating to US surely cannot be the answer. Or better yet, spare your fucks, you only have finite number of fucks in your life. Deny your relatives and the system the fucks they crave.

EDIT: In case I wasnt clear, I dont want you to form political parties and turn kejri 2.0(unless, ofcourse you want to; then by all means...) . I personally chose not to  attach any emotional significance to this whole reservation pamaada. I know, escapism isnt the answer and isnt helping the social situation, but hey, I am lazy, selfish and art of not giving fuck have worked wonders historically, ex Shiva and Budhha . Its just that before suggesting others to emigrate to wonderland, realize that your ancestors have worked hard, fought hard, walked thousands of KMs of desert & mountain to be a part of India. 

If you can get worked up enough, to consider moving abroad and turn 2nd citizen or even rant over here, sure as hell you'll find it logical to think up of a way to solve this ( **relatively** ) superficial problem of reservation.
Also, leaving India in 2015 is plain stupid. India will soon be the [fastest growing economy](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/05/07/imf-pegs-india-to-be-one-of-worlds-fastest-growing-economies/). Expected GDP growth of China- 7.2 , India - 7.8 . I will not turn this into a pro/anti Modi thing now. India is world's youngest country (demographically), and FUCK IT, at the risk of sounding desh-premi,I AM EXCITED ABOUT INDIA's FUTURE. I WANT TO WITNESS ITS METAMORPHOSIS FROM THE INSIDE, FOR BETTER OR WORSE.  You don't get the concept of Affirmative action, do you? oh mahn, thats pretty bad! good luck for FTII

i am planning to settle in my village in Uttar Pradesh, kheti-baari karunga, will keep cows for calcium n chickens for sunday brunch. tax free kheti karunga. aur toh aur 10 saal zyada jeunga. the current scenario is not at all good for a middle class open folks. jiske pass paise hai. they r going abroad.

 The sense of entitlement in some of these reserved quota pricks is too much. They would not hesitate to start riots and setting things on fire if caste based reservation was abolished. I have also seen rallies where the leader of these pricks says there should be reservations in the private sector as well. >Everyday I wake up and regret being born in this country.

I know this feel very well bro. Pata nahi kaunse paap kare the jo yahan paida hua. I study at one of the top engineering colleges in India, I had to settle with my 3rd choice(though I don't regret it) because I scored less marks and people with 10 times my rank study in my first choice branch. It feels frustrating but let it go and try to work with whatever opportunities you get because life isn't fair. I didn't know about FTII.",Photography,2015-06-20 02:39:23
How do you deal with your friends/relatives who ask you do to something for them just because you are good at it professionally/amateurishly & asking you is cheaper option then hiring someone other professional ?,40,5lsibx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5lsibx/how_do_you_deal_with_your_friendsrelatives_who/,19,"For instance, I have been asked to do photography at an event by a friend of mine, but I dont want to do since if I shoot I wont get time to enjoy.I suggested some other names but he wants me since apparently likes my photography.  If I reject, he becomes displeased, probably wont invite me for the party... or be salty during bday when he meets me. 
",McStark46," Screw up once, they will not ask you again.

Alternatively, learn to say no to bad friends. If he doesn't invite you just cause you will not take photographs, he doesn't want you there anyway. I don't have to worry about this. Most of my relatives think I'm a good for nothing loser. [removed] Ask them to pay upfront I have fixed, assembled many many many computers of my neighbours, friends, neighbour's colleague's, even some random person's. They never paid me shit even when I have spent hours and days.

I didn't feel bad at all for hiring me for free instead of calling a repair person who charges at least ‚Çπ500, because I was doing what I love, some of them called me for dinner.

Yeah they were taking advantage of me, I was a little kid, couldn't deny on their face. Tell them you have prior paid assignments on same day. If they want your service, they will get message that this person will face loss of income on that day if we ask him/ her to do photoshoot for free. Henceforth,  while casual talks with your friends share your experience that photography involves lot of hard work , expensive gears and editor and designer's pay and still some people ask us to work for free. Slowly people around you will get message that nothing comes free ( except Jio's network ) in this world.   I don't face the same problem, but my sister and cousin do - they're both photographers/designers and family members keep relying on them for free services. 

Basically, they've started being a lot more open about how this is not OK - that it effects their income opportunities or that of another person who would have been hired. They don't wait for someone to ask for a favour, but when given the opportunity (say a chat about work, or annoyances) they bring this up. Then they've recruited me and other closer friends to also advocate on their behalf. This way most people now know better than to ask them in the first place. 

And if they still get guilted into doing something (""we didn't hire a photographer, so please bring you camera ... hahaha ..."") They'll do a very basic job. Their first priority will be to enjoy the function and the second priority will be to take pictures. They'll take a handful of good pictures and let it be. If the person asks where the pictures are - they're honest about the fact that they just didn't have enough time to take so many pictures, and that a professional is the best bet if you want things properly covered.   [removed] Ask them for some awkward favour. Not money. 

Sure, sure, you are my bro. But sun na, ek kaam tha. Make them work for it.
  >If I reject, he becomes displeased, probably wont invite me for the party... or be salty during bday when he meets me.

Dude, just grow a pair and don't give a fuck about either of these things. People don't fuck around with people who take their own self-respect seriously. 

Anyway, suppose either happens:
""Hey, how come I can't find our good mutual friend McStark46?!""
""Oh... He wasn't feeling well."" 
When asked about it, you spill the truth and your friend gets a bad reputation.

If he's salty to you... just don't GAF and enjoy with others.

Simple yaar. Easy. Give them an estimated price quote. If they want to hire you after that, good for you. If not, the message has been conveyed. The gist is - Learn to create boundaries, make clear what your boundaries are, learn to say no. Its either pay or favour based...

Atleast works with friends.

Relatives idk -.- better to be ""busy"" Name your price. And keep it high enough for the friend to be able show their appreciation, and make it acceptable for you to miss out on the festivities. You win no matter whether they choose to hire you of not, at that point. Send him a huge ass bill later on for the services. Then follow up four five times and forget about it cause he won't pay.

Then when other friends ask for free work tell them by mocking the first friend that he hasn't only paid yet so don't trust you guys. 

Btw you sure they're friends? Lol.  I suffer from this.

Now my motto is ""If you're good at something, never do it for free"".",Photography,2017-01-03 23:34:35

J.T singh was not a man who we thought would ever take the easy way out. 

DC article : http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150809/nation-current-affairs/article/chennai-%E2%80%98harassed%E2%80%99-sikh-student-ends-life

the DC article is accurate except for this.
>When DC contacted Kanathur inspector P. Asokan in connection with the suicide, he brushed aside the whole incident down saying that the student committed suicide due to ‚Äòlove failure‚Äô or a failed relationship.

this is false story. JT had no love failure. in fact he was happy in his own way and never mentioned any relationship issues in our day to day talks. all of jt's friends knew what he was going through at the hands of the principal, A.venugopal (aka hitler of AMET). this is not the first time this man has mistreated students. he was the principal of the department of marine engineering for decades and he exercised his reign of terror relentlessly often threatening students having disciplinary issues with termination of their well earned placements and other job offers as well as personaly humiliating their parents in front of other college officials. he was a fanatic who wanted all his students to be mute slaves who will never raise their voice against him or his actions. there is a limit for a student to tolerate the negativity. the principal was a man who felt no remorse for his actions. it is extremely saddening to realize that a life of a student had to be taken for everyone to question mr. venugopal's authority. in his death note JT singh clearly specified his name and hoped that no one would fall victim to this man's brutality ever again. 

jt singh was a passionate photographer and a talented speaker. he was a man of will and there was always purpose in whatever he did. it is agonizing to know that he is with us no more. we all miss you JT!! i hope nobody will ever have to go through what you went through.

",venugops," Something similar happened to an Architecture student recently in A.P. She ended her life due to severe ragging by students who were pretty close to the principal of that college. The principal ignored the ragging complaints and even drunk danced with the students in the freshers party.  More about venugopal the hitler of AMET http://imgur.com/a/0qkf8 Hey OP sorry to hear your loss. I know college is melancholic for some, I've been there too. But thankfully never been driven to the point of suicide. Jt singh , he is a bravest guy in my batch, but i didn't thnk he would do like dis. Jz thnk if the guy lyk him did lyk dis hw much tortured he went through by venu... he is not a coward dat venu is coward he should hve ashamed by nw. My only wish his dis will not gng to happen for younger generation.... No one will go through this kind of torture by their administration. Make his lyf worthy rip my frnd u ll live in our hearts Hearing about a young sikh person hanging himself with his turban touched me more deeply than your average suicide... May because media portrays them as warriors and proud people, you never think about anything like this to them really. Story of South India. Oppression in the name of culture and religion. It can never be considered a progressive region till they tackle the harsh truths. bc, everything happens due to love failure. http://imgur.com/a/ikbyw I have teetered on the brink before on three distinct occasions. At the face of it, the triggering situation does seem dire enough to just take the plunge. 

What keeps me from jumping is how people around me would go on with life. My wife and parents would just be heartbroken. there is no way I could do that to them - sending them through the pain of losing a loved one to suicide. 

It is a far braver decision to live on for others than end the pain for yourself. To anybody contemplating suicide - please spare a thought on how it would affect those that care about you.  If there were a place we could report such people, a lot of students like J.T. would still be alive. 

r/India, If you're ever put in his position, how will you handle it?

 yaar look for an opportunity and beat the crap out of the guy already! My university had its share of student deaths. One or two were suicide, a bunch were accidents. 

Local yellow journalism rags twisted each and every death without fail into some story of unrequited love or sordid sex. Cops were also eager to put those tags on every death. College management was happy to go along because that absolved them of any and all responsibility. If you're a parent of a dead teen, you have no power. Unless you're rich and powerful. Everyone wants to blame the victim.

Now the new trend is to imply that the victim had depression and hence killed themselves. This is what scares me the most. I have mental health issues, but this is why I am very secretive in real life about my mental health issues and treatment. I tell my closest friends and family constantly 'if I die, it's most certainly not intentional' from time to time because if I do die, I want a full police investigation on suspicion of foul play.  Need justice....cant leave as it is....today its jt singh.....tomrw there will a another one....need to stop itttt.....so fight for justice....its not a suicide....its a planed murder.....it s a Crime for conviction of provoking suicide...

My budget is ~15k and I have these models in my mind: Celestron 114EQ (Rs. 15k), 127EQ (Rs. 17k), 70AZ (Rs 13k), 114EQ (15k).


Cannot visit Tejraj shop Mumbai as I am based in some other state, so above prices are from amazon.in.


Thanks in advance!

Edit : a word.",garibo_ka_nietzsche," If this is your first time observing, I'd recommend you get a good pair of binoculars. They're as good, if not better, than a beginner telescope and are way more portable. 

The Olympus DPS-I 10x50 are probably the best pair of binocs you can buy for the price. I've seen nebulae, galaxies and clusters with mine :) 

Get a telescope after you're sure that you want to continue astronomy. You can go for a 6-inch Dobsonian then instead of these scopes which aren't really that good. ",Photography,2017-04-15 02:08:38
"Fellow Randians, are there any amateur astronomers on here? Hobbyist star gazers?",11,4m5ooe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4m5ooe/fellow_randians_are_there_any_amateur_astronomers/,34,"Greetings! 

As a passionate, but extremely amateur stargazer who is taking baby steps in this hobby, I have recently taken the decision to buy a serious telescope (a 10"" Pro Dobsonian by GSO). 

For said purpose, I was just over on /r/telescopes, where I was informed there were a lot of amateur astronomers on from India asking about telescopes. Which got me wondering, are there any fellow hobbyists out there with an interest and experience in astronomy, sky watching and astro photography in /r/India? I only ask because the best way to learn something new is to learn it hands on from one on one interaction. 

Anybody out there?",temporarilyyours," [deleted] If you are in Bangalore, you can go to Association of Bangalore Amateur Astronomers. It is based from Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium. They organize cool things every week. They even teach how to make your own Telescope.  I love stargazing, but in cities is a traumatic experience. 

I went to Pelling, Sikkim in 2013, and the stars I saw there will never be beat by anything. It was like a whole new world.  I am an amateur stargazer too, nice to see so many of you here. I plan to get my first telescope soon but I need to save up first. I'm currently in a coastal town where the humidity is disorienting and the night skies are usually overcast. I mostly follow an astronomical calendar and stay up to see if there any aberrant phenomena showing up in the night sky. I was able to catch a [meteor shower](http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-lyrid-meteor-shower) about a month ago, it was beautiful. It's cool that you're getting a Newtonian as your first one, please post your experience with the telescope once you get it. Cheers.  Was active as an amateur astronomer for some time before giving up the hobby due to time constraints. I'd not suggest a Dobsonian for a beginner at all. Please go for a refractor with alt azimuth alignment.


And if your city doesn't have good dark spots around or it is cloudy most of the day, really not worth investing in this.

Happy to answer any questions. The kind folk of Indian Amateur Astronomers Club on FB are pretty amazing and helpful. I want to start. But i live in a small city and have no idea where to begin. :(",Photography,2016-06-02 13:30:20
So R/india what are your hobbies?,35,1otqn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1otqn2/so_rindia_what_are_your_hobbies/,251,"Should have put this up on friday, but was busy with a normal boring life.

I've noticed there are a bunch of shutterbugs here, and that got me curious, what other hobbies do other people have on r/india?

Any trekkers/bookworms/gamers/<insert your hobby> here?

<... my poor inbox>


Edit: Photography (hobby/passion), reading, movies and travel seem to be popular. 

Surprisingly no eating? Also Occasionally pet management, a really nice fish tank... We could probably organize a book exchange.",parlor_tricks," I loved electronics so much that I studied electronics. I built bugs and receivers, audio amps, stereo decks, speakers and was saving money for a digital multimeter when I got a break into IT. Now, I am a self proclaimed master chef. I love traveling, music, all kind of music and I love watching suspense thriller drama^(not the KJO types) movies. I love books and reading. I've read continuously for the last 17 years non stop, one book after another and have collected quite a bit. I've recently started rebuilding my entire library. It's a passion which will always be there till i die. I hope to pass all this on. Books, Comics, etc. EDIT: I recently starting collecting autographed books. Have only a few packed away. 
I also love Philately and Philosophy. I'm also fairly into Zen. I am an agnostic but i love reading all the religious books too. Apart from these, i am into the regular things: Travelling, TV, Movies, Music and all that.  Arduino / Books

Also, I have a Yamaha electronic keyboard upstairs which is carefully wrapped in bedsheets to avoid dust collecting on it, SINCE I CAN'T FUCKING PLAY IT. :D Eating and Gaming!!!

Hail /r/IndianGaming :D I dunno. Watch porn maybe.  [My main hobby is bird photography.](http://500px.com/akshay_charegaonkar/sets/reddit_ama_sample_shots)

Apart from that, I love to travel. It's difficult to find time for these hobbies due to work, though. audiobooks, chess, reddit. programming.  I rediscovered the joy of reading after getting a membership at the local lending library. Besides reading, I've been learning about Linux (in a bid to discover free software) and I'm happy to say that I was able to troubleshoot my way out of a bind when my laptop borked on me on boot. :D

I also watch anime, if that can be categorized as a hobby. Writing, reading(mostly philosophy) and watching movies. I watch way too many movies. [deleted] I was into photography, now into making films. I love finding new music and gobble up all the politics /r/india has to offer. After joining Reddit is when I first got into talking and reading about it. My Pets are the best stress busters. 

House is a growing menagerie. Started with 3 Dogs, now have one [Rottweiler called Kali]. Have 2 lovebirds, 4 Planted tanks with Shrimps and Fishes. Planning to get a Guinea Pig and Hamster next month.

Also into amateur Astronomy when the clouds are clear in Bangalore. Nothing but politics and chai :/ I'm surprised to not see 90% of /r/india go - cricket and bollywood music. 

Indians as a majority suppress hobbies. Anything that doesn't bring in money in any form is not worth participating in. I play guitar, keyboard and enjoy travelling.

And films! I enjoy films from all over the world Passions more than hobby - Astronomy, Writing, Gaming, Photography and Travelling (Hiking and Trekking)!! Reading books, listening to music and working out! Writing, reading, photography, travel, music, movies.

Some of them aren't even proper hobbies, just something to do in spare time Well, there is reading and gaming.

I like to swim too. I draw things.. some are good, some terrible. Since my daughter loved them, I drew Mickey /Minnie etc - then went to lion king. Now planning for Ice Age. Three years ago I bought a classical guitar called 'Givson' on a whim and in my spare time I kick out some jams. Photography. Some samples:

I have really started enjoying taking photographs with my phone. Here are some samples:

Travelling. Last went to Bruges, Belgium.

Reading. Anything well written. Usually I read light fiction with a non-fiction book. Right now I am reading '[A thousand Splendid Suns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns)' and '[Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Lives:_In_Search_of_the_Sacred_in_Modern_India)'
 I used to change my hobbies every 6 months. As a parent my hobby-times have come down drastically.

here are some of them:
1. Cricket - Own a mini-library, autobiographies of several all-time-great, video clips of famous matches, several cricketing magazines, lot of rare cricket stuff including autographs of the 1976 Indian cricket team and a 2 Kilo scrapbook of newspaper clippings from the 1960s.

2. Basketball - Coached an under-10 team in a Little League in the US, biographies of half a dozen basky greats, couple of famous basketball movies, two dozen great games on DVD, used to wake up and ride to a court to shoot free-throws for an hour each morning.

3. Sports - in general an attic full of sportsmagazines since childhood. Parents keep throwing them away, still retained a few.

4. Researched the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka online - talked to a few people online and over email who were directly affected. Read every book on the conflict....this was some roughly 1000 hours around 2005-2009.

5. Currently - parenting skills, read about 50 books on the topic. Also read a ton of books on having a great marriage, interacting with seniors, etc...I do 'free counseling'/mentoring on relationships for the folks that know me well :)

(I'm in my mid-30s so there are a bunch of other hobbies that fall in the 'done it and dealt with' category) Quizzing Photography, Fort Treks

Drives, Movies

and lately into cars Technology, coding, new software, astronomy. Guitar. [deleted] Travelling, eating and keeping fish. 

Yes, I'm an avid aquarist. I have kept many different species of fish in the past two years. I currently have a planted tank with native Indian species.  Video games, anime and manga, gunpla, magic the gathering, books/novels, music. Two wheels and an twisty highway (full tank of fuel optional). I'll ride anything on two wheels - from bicycles to scooterettes to all types of motorcycles. Nothing makes me happier than a full day on the road. I enjoy too many things. Reading, programming, writing, poetry, music from all over the world, scriptwriting for short films etc (currently writing a tv series just for fun) I love trekking and I like editing videos too. [Here's a sample of both coming together.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMZ22lfYCVY
)

Apart from that, I enjoy working out. It gets me from Monday to Wednesday to Friday.
 listening to podcast,punching a boxing bag if that's a hobby.running, learning guitar. 

making free web apps. yup that's summarizes me. 
 I've done some model photography (outside of India) but I'm still trying to figure out how to contact models here in India (amateur / tfp). Anyone else have any experience? Matchbox collection I play a bit of Harmonica. Reading, photography and travelling are other passions. I used to collect MAtchbox lables when I was a kid since Philately is an expensive hobby. Travelling and eating, so i joined Third Party Inspection agency. I get new sites mostly after 2-3 months. In 3 years of experience i have seen and lived in most states of India and did assignment in Netherlands, China, North Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Dubai, Brunei and Kenya. I also got chance to be in offshore oil rig in KG Basin.     Gaming.  Am a birder. Some images from last year. 
http://m.flickr.com/#/photos/11366385@N00/ Traveling, Visited 14 Countries.  I (used to) collect First Day Covers. I've been meaning to get back to it for a while now.... Reading manga, gaming and watching TV shows :) [removed] I have a secret hobby.

Redditing. Photography programming Watching movies and reading about  them, I watch around 300+ movies an year on average. 

Edit : Cooking also. Reading: As long as the content is well written, I will read it. I like reading long form articles. Poor language will turn me off, no matter how important the content is. For books, I prefer to read dystopia, fantasy and mysteries. 

Music: Sennheiser HD 598 and semi-classical / Indian classical (or electric) fusion and I can zone out for a couple of hours easily. Excellent for coding as well. 

Talking: I like interacting with people. I'd go crazy if I spend an entire day without talking with someone. 

Writing: When all else fails to calm me, I write. Sometimes in English, sometimes in Hindi.  I love aeromodelling and anything to do with airplanes. Also photography, gaming, riding, movies, reading. I'm big on music, mostly progressive rock. I love Tool and Porcupine tree.   Hiking - most recently at Lake Tahoe in Nevada,USA 
Reading - starting on a Rushdie novel
 Asking people what are their hobbies. Playing guitar, reading (I'm currently looking for something good and non-pulpy to read, like Bertrand Russell or Kurt Vonnegut), watching films (Kurosawa, Spielberg, Kubrick, etc.), listening to '70s progressive rock, and writing poetry and essays. Reading and learning whatever i can. Ladki dekhne aaya hain kya?",Photography,2013-10-20 15:50:36
