Ex-PM Manmohan Singh: The state of economy today is deeply worrying. Last quarter's GDP growth rate of 5% signals that were in midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has potential to grow at a much faster rate but all round mismanagement by Modi govt has resulted in this slowdown.,654,cy66pf,https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1168025028916465665?s=19,118,,Gavthi_Batman," Let's not forget, 5 is the biggest *answer* they could come up with. A colleague was saying ""educated people should never run country they cannot take brave steps like Modi does"".. People seriously don't care about economy all they care about is Pakistan and Kashmir. BJP is doing right ... We are fucked boys More on current situation:

>Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh: It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector's growth is tottering at 0.6%. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the govt to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.


In such distressed time for economy, even [few words](https://twitter.com/INCIndia/status/1168018140971905024?s=19), even a criticism (though he rarely criticize anybody) by him is like rain in drought...

Wish he had majority in parliament like the incumbent PM, wish he could implement his knowledge and experience to grow India into superpower... My father runs a business in the automotive industry and says that this is the worst slowdown he's seen is 25 years. He says even 2008 was better and that was during a global recession. Factories halting or running 2/7 days, bodyshops shutting down or halting orders etc(throughout India). These are really troubling times. I hope that change is forced quickly or we'll stunt ourselves for a really long time. I don't know how competent the people in charge of the decisions regarding finances are. 

You just pick anyone random and make him/her the finance Minister. I know they don't make the decisions themselves, have a team of supposedly experts behind them, but I won't be surprised if the so called experts may also just be bootlickers rather than competent individuals.

And it should not be tough to find competent people in our country. Check out the comments in any article reporting the same.. bhakths out in full force abusing him..to solve a problem you have to admit that you have one. Cow economics and ram mandir finally taking effect. Acche din bros. He's not wrong. This guy is hands down *the* greatest Prime Minister the country has ever had. No politics, no drama, no braggadocio, no bullshit. He wasn't tainted by crises like Indira Gandhi or Nehru, either. He was all work and no talk. He singlehandedly pulled India out of the mouth of a potential economic depression in 1991 and helped set it on the right track as Prime Minister. 2004 to 2009 saw stratospheric economic growth and even 2009-2014, despite the global financial turbulence, was pretty impressive. No amount of praise will be enough for his contributions to India's growth story. 

But, today's hateful, terrorist-electing India doesn't deserve him. India deserves Yogi Adityanath, Sakshi Maharaj, Pragya Singh Thakur, Amit Shah and that failed theater actor-cum-riot-monger.

PS: Enjoy the Hindutva way of running an economy, India. Just another 5 years. Or maybe 50. Make the most of it anyway. Condition of bhakturds in 4 months of Modi 2.0 
https://twitter.com/free_thinker/status/1168042369909805057 Man, I miss good old of Days of Manmohan Singh.. Remember we used to have an economy ? Now what we have is just shit and giggles I think after the end of this term Modi will have a hard time gaining popularity. Mody govt how to solve -- DENY Could anyone estimate how low the GDP will be if we had the old non fudged formula?? We chutiya Indians deserve such economy.. We all are bullyish in nature and we don't care about actual growth. We will make fun of your introvertedness and will laud extrovertedness of Modi even though he know shit. Though if you have said two words when the corruption was high in Congress, we wouldn't have given or even consider BJP. bjp didn't came bcoz of mandir and cows, but it came bcoz of people being fedup with your untolerable silence towards the shameful corruption

You were too much introvert and the current one is too much extrovert. No balance in between Sadhus are becoming CMs. What do you expect? The comments as usual are cancer. The job market is so fucked already, can't imagine how much more worse it can get C'mon now , someone should come up with solutions! Amd BJP govt should fucking accept it and implement it ! Nirmala Sitharaman's response for any question about the economy is acting all haughty and telling the finance secretary to answer it If this man would have been allowed to rule unhindered from the Gandhi duo he would have completely transformed the country. Man, I miss the golden era of booming growth of the 70s. Overall economy - worldwide, has slowed down.

"Hello Top Minds of R/india, Is the Indian economy being nokia-ed?",50,cz0ctb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cz0ctb/hello_top_minds_of_rindia_is_the_indian_economy/,42,"I am uncomfortable with the narrative that the bureaucrats and figureheads in the Indian government are clueless morons tanking our economy. Why can't it be the same thing Microsoft did to Nokia? Force a fire sale of Indian government assets. Maybe we are up for the biggest wealth transfer to the richest elite in this country since demonetization? Or am i wearing my tin foil hat a little too tight?

Edit: Spelling",H1ken," One of the biggest reasons for this slowdown is the death of private consumption. It was the only wheel that was sustaining the economy. Now with rural consumption taking a hit, the government is clueless. To revive demand it needs to pump that RBI surplus as development expenditure, but it risks increasing the inflation. With lower income rates and if inflation rises the government is on for a disaster.
Long story short, the government is walking on fire. Why not both? Their cluelessness contributed to the current slowdown, but they are also corrupt enough to use this opportunity to transfer Air India etc to Adani et al for cheap.

Also privatization does not have to be the government's brain child. It could simply be the government's friends seeing an opportunity and them 'convincing' the government. > Force a fire sale of Indian government assets.

This is a good rationale actually. Keep the tinfoil hat, we'll see more patterns like this. I am more interested in knowing what microsoft did to Nokia? It will happen. There are a lot of PSUs that the govt wants to rid of, but who will buy it when the buyers themselves are in a slump? 1) Global recession was long forecasted for 2020 
2) We failed to capitalise opportunity to get business from China 
3) Indian economy rested on what we call ""black money"" , addition of cluster mess which we call gst further compounded it, lack of government trust, and dynamic policies and if that was not enough the accumulation of money from middle class to elite few who won't invest leads to the perfect concoction to kick down our economy. Don't forget recession is part of economy cycle. 

Probable future :We should expect deflation of economy which will lead to lower product costs but also more job losses. 

Possible but unlikely: Govt may decrease interest rate in favor of inflation, now do remember most people use interest as investment option and they may get fked , but I don't see it increasing borrowings. New minted currencies + deflation + lower currency exchange value against usd may lead us down to Zimbabwe root Inviting the top minds of r/India? 246000 replies coming up Damn right!

We were once the 3310 of world economy...sigh! It's hard to predict as this recession seems to be a cyclic one, it's not just India but globally the investment is slowing. There are many factors that can be attributed to current downturn and for every industry there's a different reason. What I believe is that India in actuality never recovered well from 2008, while in fiscal terms we were out of recession very quickly this was in parts fuelled by the excessive lending during 2009-12 from various public/private sector banks.

Till 2013 coupled with High Crude oil prices economy loomed, around 2014 crude oil prices decreased but the effects of NPA's started kicking in economy. During the same time many big loans started converted to NPA's and the every single month the NPA's ballooned. 

In between the Central Government's implementation of GST and Demonetisation fractured a lot of domestic consumption, as a lot of it depended on Black money ( This is my personal opinion ).  The current government failed to control the NPA's till Q1 FY’19 when there was reduction of stocks of NPA's  by \~Rs.21,000 Cr. 

The government now has started to refinance these banks and merge them, although merging shouldn't have been a priority, while it wasn't a bad step per say. The surplus that Government skimmed from RBI a part of it might be used for PSB Recapitalisation which seems to be a good step, again it's hard to predict anything when it comes to economy its a dynamic system of scale that no one can comprehend.

Rich will always get richer, there's no problem in that. I believe the important issue is for the countries large population ( India )  is to deliver jobs and grow middle class. With a lot of manufacturing automation / automation it would be hard to grow a middle class ( again this is an assumption ) . At this stage it's very difficult to predict to what extent automation is going to affect the job market. 

Now coming to selling assets , may be or may be not. There's no singular answer. 

I think governments montenisation plans on non-core assets is fine, if some business / riches can get even more rich through clever understanding of Indian bureaucracy it's still not a bad deal , not atleast for an average tax paying Indian middle class citizen,  we won't have to shell out money for operations of various CPSEs that are a burden on our pockets. The biggest concern is how this government has a socialistic attitude for the poor and a capitalistic outtake for ultra-rich. There is a very little concern for middle class, anyhow this is nothing new. 

We need to stop relying on Central / State governments, as for our business rather than expecting government to provide incentive for domestic business ( like China does ) , a lot of our business have to grow Global ambitions rather than fixating ourselves on Indian domestic market. I don't think the toxic mix of bureaucrats who are selected through UPSC with questionable hiring process and Politicians will be mature enough to understand the dynamic global market. While it's an extremely painstaking process but I do see a lot of business growing in core engineering services in India ( from mobile transceivers, SDR to Custom ASIC's ) who are actually making a lot of money. Leaving aside fancy AI / ML ( essentially decorated statisticians ).   
There are huge opportunities in global markets, only if we have vision and risk taking aptitude. Our economy is not just and shouldn't solely depend on a immature Government structure.

Bottlenecks of Indian economy compounded by the policies of first Modi government,95,cp7sen,https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/cover-story/bottlenecks-of-indian-economy-compounded-by-the-policies-of-first-modi-government/articleshow/70624190.cms,16,,azemda," See, I believe that not only this government but every government from the past decade is responsible for this.

My grandparents are farmers in Andhra Pradesh.
He harvest 25 acres of land. In the past decade itself, I have not seen a single rice crop being harvested properly. There are at a stage where even in rural areas they need to buy rice.

When there is a good crop, the prices are down. 
They sell at 25kgs for ₹600-800. While in Delhi I buy at ₹2500/-. I can't understand this gross miscalculation. Farmer isn't getting it and we as a consumer paying more than thrice of it.

Coming to Auto sector, ""Maruti"" doesn't produce world class products in India. Taking an example of Swift model. There are many differences in Indian version and overseas version. So, if the sales slump in domestic market they can't even push it to overseas. It's a high time for these companies to produce high quality products. 

This government doesn't even know basic economics. How will they? They don't have even one person who has a sound market knowledge.
Giving loans to people like Neerav Modi and making him flee. While giving a free hand to income tax officers.

Irony.

Situation will only get worse. Don't worry. > The liquidity crunch has become tighter because it’s no longer as easy to do business. AIM Nonwovens sought refunds of Rs21 lakh for the Goods & Services Tax...

This bit boils my blood. The tax you have to pay is due immediately, but your input claims are never accepted on time, especially if it is a large amount. Idk if this idea is dumb but i think our cultural economy has so much potential and it's obviously being under utilised.

I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,95,c95ykl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/,46,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",MelodicBerries," Based on your summary, (and good of you to make the effort!) the economic survey is goobleydook. 

If they’re busy saying general equilibrium theory is Anglo Saxon economics (and somehow behavioral stuff is not?) then it’s some weird waste of time in the “you aren’t even wrong” kind of bad.

I’m going to go read it. Now one else has to waste their time on this shit. Literally /r/badeconomics. Thank you for your service to the nation. One of the worst economic survey's ever in the recent years. It was expected, given how the current CEA got his job,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnamurthy_Subramanian#Career

>In articles published in The Times of India and Livemint titled, ""Will Black Be Back? Why demonetisation will be revolutionary in India’s fight against corruption"", and ""Demonetisation: Are the poor really suffering?"", respectively, Subramanian supported the Government of India's banknote demonetisation policy in 2016. What didn't catch your eye

1. Nudge economics and excessive stress on behavioural economics -> it seems like a kind of foreshadowing and a prelude to ""excuses for data theft""

2. After speaking few pages on gibberish on big data and data, the govt reiterates the same lines as it did before aadhar judgment. Sovereignty of data, state security and providing cheap data to corporates while again, using the garb of security and ease of biz

3. All the wanking on beti bachao beti padhao being an immense success and swacchh bharat being a great success. Sorry to let you know, the chapters seemed kind of promotion than anything related to policy prescription. That's quite a downgrade, even under NDAs standards, given I haven't missed an ES since 2014

4. For all the bashing of anglo saxon economics. Do yourself a favor. Pick up es 2018, book 1. See chapter 1 or chapter 2 (basically the big chapter). In one of the boxes, where it compares to USA and then later in another of the chapters, where it compares savings and investment slowdowns across economies, it shamelessly uses Rodriks theory and proves, India shouldn't give a Damn about savings rate. This time it did a 180. 😂 Bro thank you for the effort You missed out The Nudge. The mass control program. They are gonna make robots out of people. For the first time ever, a government has openly admitted to using behavioral control. Just imagine the consequences of it as used in electoral politics. Thank you! Can you please ELI5 general equilibrium theory? I am little concern about mutual alienation between india and russia and in return US's backstabbing. 

Theoretically US-China's trade war should benefit india, but by the way US has treated us in the previous term i am not sure. High quality stuff.. thanks! [deleted] So is this a major policy break then? Is India ditching free market economics for some sort of a social democracy (e.g., like the Nordic Model) or are we adapting the managed-economy model of China? Could someone explain exactly what Nudges the govt is implementing?

RBI's deputy governor Viral Acharya quits six months before his term ends,99,c4hsqq,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbis-deputy-governor-viral-acharya-quits-six-months-before-his-term-ends/articleshow/69920503.cms,38,,killswitch13," >Acharya has been uncomfortable ever since the exit of Urjit Patel as Governor of RBI. His academic views of the financial system was in contrast with the rest of the system. 

Bichde sabhi baari baari... BC hope there's no announcement coming that he wants to disown. This was bound to happen. Oh this is bad. Very very bad.

Deputy governor is a very important member of the Monetary Policy Committee ( one that decides policy stance and repo rates, basically major macroeconomic decisions ). This 5 member panel has government nominees too and decisions are taken by majority vote. 

Since the decisions are taken by a majority vote, it is always advisable to have majority economists so that RBI policies are not driven by political agendas but only sound economics.

And he was one of the few economists in the panel that constitute the MPC, especially after they replaced an economist with a Bureaucrat as the governor RBI.

So why would he quit? Essentially because there's no point for him to be there as virtual liquidation of RBI as an institution has lead to loss of value of individual opinion. In an organisation dominated by bureaucrats, decisions are now not taken in Mumbai ( RBI HQ ) but in Delhi. 

Terrible news. The off balance sheet borrowing pegs the fiscal deficit at 8-9% of the GDP.

So much easier to pass reforms in dictatorship than in a democracy where people care about their political party and winning elections more than they care for the country. Let's stop this silly comparison to China. The beat us badly in the last 1-2 decades, and we are not going to catch up with them now. I am not sure how many commenting have actually read the article,  headline is misleading and does not tell what is the comparison,  bloomberg talks of defense budget mainly, in what sense can india compete with china's defense budget, china is a much bigger economy and have more spending power and is not comparable to india Because economic growth is exponential. The increase in the size of the economy depends on the current size of the economy. China's economy is already 5 times ours. Military spending and geo-political influence which the article is talking about depend on the current size of the economy. It is mathematically impossible for India to 'catch up' with China unless China's economic growth slips to around 2%. Has more to do with China performing exceptionally well than India underperforming.

India is the fastest growing major economy right now but will never reach the crazy per year growth China has had. Mitron....china ki growth kya hai bus ek waham hai Catapult ko bhi peeche Kheecha hota hai bhaiyya🤣 defense spending is not a good way to measure anything, we need to see educational and health spend Hey I don't think that is the case though. If you only read the media you think India is incredibly corrupted and all the streets have trash on them. In reality some areas are quite prosperous, clean, and modern.

"What do you think that a united India would have looked like in terms of development, the economy, foreign policy, et cetera?",14,cezrj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cezrj9/what_do_you_think_that_a_united_india_would_have/,6,"What do you think that a united India would have looked like in terms of development, the economy, foreign policy, et cetera? As in, what kinds of domestic policy and foreign policy do you think that a united India (one that keeps Pakistan and Bangladesh) would have had and also how would its economy, economic development, industrialization, and business climate compare to that of India in real life?",Souhondron," An undivided India would've been a disaster which would have made Indians pine for the rule of the British. The compromises that the Congress and the Muslim league would have had to make to avoid partition would've led to an extremely weak centre and immensely strong regional provinces, this would've quickly led to the creation of communal blocs in India with the Muslim provinces of Kashmir, sind, eastern Bengal, Punjab (barely Muslim majority though),NWFP facing off against the Hindu provinces elsewhere.

There would have been competitive communalism to an extent that you can't even imagine. The Muslim league during British times often petitioned them to declare Sind and NWFP as new provinces because they desired numerical parity with the Hindu dominated provinces of present day India like Bombay, Madras, UP etc. This was because they wanted to engage in a balance of power type of situation where if a UP state passes a law banning say, cow slaughter then NWFP will pass a law banning public celebration of Diwali. This communalist tit for tat would've only strengthened communal forces and led quickly to a civil war situation only in this case the violence wouldn't have been confined to the border provinces of Punjab and Bengal but would've engulfed the whole territory of the sub continent. There would be riots in Sindh and in retaliation there would be riots in Kerala. 

In foreign policy terms India would have a restive Muslim population in Pakistan which would look for third party support from fellow Muslim nations of Iran and Afghanistan. This would be especially potent because there are vast historical and cultural links between the border territories with Pashtuns in the case of Pakistan and Balochis in the case of Iran, crudely the Indus river actually is the real dividing line between Indian people and iranic people. The Indian state would have similarly onerous defence requirements as it does now with the Pakistani border except it would also have to deal with a local population whose loyalty would always be suspect. Pakistan has tried to pre empt Pashtun nationalism by raising up the Taliban to supplant it with Islamic radicalisation, an option not available to a Non Islamic Indian state. 

India would also be much more vulnerable to the mess in Central Asia and the middle East, both of the cold war (like Iran and Afghanistan) as well as the recent rise of Isis type Islamic extremism. This has nearly destroyed the Pakistani state but the borders between the two countries has shielded India from the worst of it. The Punjabi Muslim (according to Ambedkar) was always the most susceptible to ideas of Muslim brotherhood with the ability of radicals to weaponise this (like with the Mujahideen). If these people were in the Indian state then it is more than plausible that they would still be as radicalized as they are now, except now as citizens of India they would have free reign to carry out attacks throughout the country instead of being largely confined to Pakistan. 

In terms of economy, Ambedkar in his thoughts on partition showcased that the provinces of present day Pakistan were mostly a drag on the British exchequer while the Indian provinces were a tax surplus. This isn't necessarily true for all times but if you factor in the communal hatred that would develop between Hindu provinces and Muslim provinces then I struggle to see a situation where the economic gains would be great. Harmony is usually better for the economy than conflict.

The situation of minorities of all types would've been worse. Indian non muslims don't really care about the situation of their co religionists in Pakistan or Bangladesh. This is pretty much true for Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims as well with one huge exception being the Babri masjid demolition which kicked off riots in Bangladesh and Pakistan aimed at Hindus there, destroying temples and killing people etc. This wouldn't be the case in an undivided India, Hindu minorities in Muslim provinces would be hostages ensuring the safety and well being of Muslim minorities in Hindu provinces. This was an idea mooted solely by the Muslim league but I'm pretty sure that once there had been a tit for tat riot then the Hindu communalists wouldn't be far behind in adopting this theory. Needless to say, not a good way to run a country.

People often say that India is secular only because it is 80% Hindu and I agree with that statement not because of any great rationality in the Hindu faith, but because the question of religious hegemony in India is settled. The proportion of muslim in undivided India would've been large enough for the Hindus to start feeling threatened and for the Muslims to start demanding their pound of flesh (and maybe a bit more). The insecurity is highest at such a point where there's a chance of hegemonic change, it could've been a domestic variant of Thucydides Trap leading to civil war and eventual fragmentation of the country. Far better for one religious group to be in the outright, unchallengeable majority and to feel secure enough by this to give rights to the minority religions.

Answering all the questions regarding RBI fiasco,97,a8qw39,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a8qw39/answering_all_the_questions_regarding_rbi_fiasco/,57,"**Who appointed Urjit Patel?**

Narendra Modi.

**Why did Raghu Ram Rajan step down?**

Because Narendra Modi and his government would not act against NPA companies. And also because draconian Demonetization was being planned.


**Why did Deputy RBI Governor Viral Acharya raise the issue of Section 7 of RBI Act and warn the Government?**

Because Government wanted to step in and take over the Reserves of 10,00,000+ Crores lying with RBI and use them to plug NPA's.


**Why does the Government want all this money?**

Because banks have been rendered empty and the 4,00,000 Crore windfall gain from Demonetization never happened.


**Why companies are declaring NPA's?**

Because their business have failed due to a failing and failing economy.


**But is the economy not doing very well under Narendra Modi?**

If that was the case, there was no need to take over RBI Reserves. The story about the economy doing well is a fake story like everything else told to you by Narendra Modi.


**What triggered this take over bid of RBI Reserves?**

Because many companies were declaring NPA's and the biggest shock came when IL&FS declared (officially) an NPA of 90,000 Crores. And none of the directors was arrested.


**But why take over RBI Reserves when it had already paid a dividend of 58,000 Crores for the last fiscal?**

Because that was not enough to fill the holes created by businessmen who lost money hand over fist.


**What will be the consequences for ordinary people when government prints more money?**

Prices will rise across the board as more money will be chasing the same basket of goods and services.



**Why Does Government of India require so much money and needs to print more?**

It is because GST has failed. From the expected collection of 1,30,000 Crores per month, it is only collecting 90,000 to 1,00,000 Crores with 30,000 Crores going back as refunds. Every month there has been a deficit of 30,000 Crores on an average.



**Why GST Collection has fallen?**

Because it has been declared by IMF as the most complex form of taxation in the world and Indian businessmen have been smart to find out ways to avoid it, also the business volume has fallen as economy has failed.



**Why Business Volume has fallen?**

If you withdraw 83% of blood of an economy for 2 months and then take 6 months to pump back that blood, you can't expect the person to get up and start running as if nothing had happened. Demonetization was such a blunder. It killed the economy and India lost 2% of GDP, which is approximately 3,00,000 Crores. And the losses continue. But Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar have both certified Demonetization as a brilliant move and they have also been endorsed by the likes of Aishwarya Rai and Paresh Rawal.



**What is the immediate danger?**

Telecom sector, that has seen mergers is now three players, Airtel, Vodafone Idea Limited and Jio and all three are bleeding. Telecom sector is sitting on 8,00,000 Crore possible NPA as estimated by SBI internal report which was later suppressed.


**What about the GDP figures that show NDA-2 doing better than UPA-2?**

Former CEA has already spoken on this and informed how the Niti Aayog changed the figures and how to make NDA-2 look better they made UPA-2 look bad. They just drew a bigger line next to the UPA-2 Line.



**Who is responsible for all this mess?**
Of course Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru is responsible for all this mess and his family. They have not allowed Narendra Modi to do anything in the last 56 months. Had Sardar Patel been the First PM, none of this might have happened.

**Who should resign?**

That's a stupid question!!! Of Course Sonia Gandhi should resign and Rahul Gandhi should resign as Congress President and Modi should be given a free hand with the 10,00,000 Crore RBI Reserves to do what he wants to do.


**Who should you vote for in 2019?**

Of course Narendra Modi, because he is the 11th Incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is the savior of Hindus. He is the only person on the face of earth who can teach Muslims a lesson. He is the only person in India who can protect the cow. He is the only person in India who takes 'care' of the poor, marginal, soldiers and veterans. He is the only person in India who can build the Ram Mandir. He is the only person on earth who has left behind his wife and family and even his mother and the only person who himself lives on 10 acres of prime property, protected by 5 layers of security while his 90+ year old mother stands in bank queues to withdraw 4000 Rupees as per demonetization rules along with a camera crew. Because he is the only PM who has traveled the world and done so many town-hall and rock-star type shows. Because he does Mann-Ki-Baat every month on Radio and it is broadcast on TV too. He is the only person who can buy 36 jets instead of 126 jets by paying the same price and convince you without giving you any data that 36 > 126 and he has in fact saved money for the nation and yet managed to give 30,000 Crores to friend Anil Ambani.

Because there is no other person in the whole country who is more qualified than him with his MA in 'Entire Political Science' and a missing BA.

Now how dare you think of voting for anyone else?""
",waahmudijiwaah," *Chaliye OP ko Wanakkam!* The RBI fiasco indicates there are bigger skeletons in the closet. Whether it is the banks or telecom or someone else, only time will tell. > Why did Raghu Ram Rajan step down?

As far as i remember, he wasnt given an extension. So if he wanted to continue he would have to follow the same procedure of appointment of an RBI governor along with other contenders i.e. being interviewed by a panel headed by the Cabinet Secretary. Just this fact is enough for a person of high repute to resign.

The reasons you mentioned are relevant as well. But RR didnt step down, he was never given an extension.  [Citation needed] Your username emplies obvious bias here.  If the economy was failing then Moody's wouldn't have upgraded Indias credit rating from Baa3 to Baa2. 

On top of that I don't see any numbers.  But just Modi is lying,  economy is failing. We are not your whatsapp junta.  Give quantifiable data to prove your forwarded as received.  Very comprehensive, and very well articulated. Couple of things I'm not up to speed with:

Just wait for bhakts to label him as a double agent  This will piss off all the right people in both the countries. Man, British are still looting our national treasury.xd

Just this time we are giving it away intentionally. Ohohohoho this will burn right through the asshole of many fellow Indians 😂😂 To put this in perspective, consider that UK has to navigate Brexit. They actually know the importance of the post of governor of central bank.You cant let politics dictate the appointment of such critical posts.Or even appoint a parrot to that post.The very minute changes in central bank has far-reaching effects in the coming years.

People underestimate the power and influence of governor of the central bank in the economy.Since his policy changes don't produce immediate results(for the common man) and takes mostly 1-2 years to show any signs.

Some people think that lowering the interest rates are the only thing the RBI chief does and if he does only that, everything will be great. TIL that Raghuram Rajan's father, R Govindararajan was a spy. ITS A PLAN.

Now he will have full access to Vijay Mallya's bank accounts in London :) And we Indians like to crib about brain drain and how everyone talented works elsewhere. If you don't make use of great talent, someone else will. 

 It will be a big advantage for Bank of England if Raghram Rajan become head of their institution.A great economist,intelligent man our government discarded him and brought a puppet to run RBI,England taking second Kohinoor from India. Nice! [removed] Shobha de moves to London.  I'm happy for him, I'm sad for myself and India. I laugh at modiji when he says Pratibha Palayan.  Not a hope.

He would turn it down himself unless the political winds turned. Head of a sinking ship is a dumb role to take. He deserves this position but Indians do not deserve great economist.
Indian Politics SUCKS... He did not give a fuck to indian politicians.
CHEERS... Watch idiots of our country go on a rant about how he’s bowing to our colonial overlords and how he has no self respect as an Indian He was in the longlist for US fed chairman post too. Let's not kid ourselves here. The lists may be diverse, but most likely the post will be filled by a white man. As it was with the fed: Jerome Powell. He was intelligent and charismatic enough to capture the attention of people or youth especially who otherwise have zero interest in Indian bureaucracy or administration.


Govt should have desperately tried to hold onto him ,on the contrary they worked out of bounds to get rid of him. [removed] No big deal, we have intellectuals like Sambit Patra and Venkaiah Naidu.  Oh, this must hit the Hindutva brigand brigade hard.

I sincerely hope he wins it. And if he does, these guys will claim he is anti-national, not recognizing the fact that it is ironical.

 Knew this was Modi's plan all along.

/s He is the best at his job, as he says :

I'm Raghuram Rajan, and I do what I do. I hope he turns things around as he did with India Only person who must be feeling sad about this is Manmohan Singh, who personally requested, hand picked or whatever you call it, Mr.Rajan to be RBI's Governor. It's sad to know he may never return, but glad he is being recognized so well in a 1st world country. Good luck for the race, you logical Indian. Great news , now Indian economy will again see a depression . LOL This bugger needs to read that Bengal famine essay that gets posted on schedule on reddit. Brain drain 😂 Rajan did not want the extension. Ask someone who you might know from RBI / senior banking circle.

As an active trader, I really hate Congress.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. 

 ______ 
**India Retains Position As Fastest Growing Economy, GDP Growth Accelerates To 7.7% In Q4** 

 ______ 
India retained its position as the world's fastest growing major economy in
the January-March quarter, well ahead of China. India's

GDP or gross domestic product

growth accelerated to 7.7 per cent in the March quarter - the fastest pace of
growth in seven quarters. Strong growth in agriculture (4.5 per cent),
manufacturing (9.1 per cent) and construction sectors (11.5 per cent)
contributed to the overall growth. Growth for Asia's third-largest economy,
reported by the Ministry of Statistics, trumped forecasts in a Reuters poll
for annual growth of 7.3 per cent. GDP had grown at a revised 7 per cent in
October-December quarter.

For the full year (2017-18), GDP expanded at 6.7 per cent, lower than the 7.1
per cent recorded in the previous year.

Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank, said: ""Today's GDP number is very
comforting and should put a lot of concerns to rest. It seems like we have
moved beyond the teething troubles related to GST implementation. The pick-up
in investment activity (fixed capital formation) is also a good sign.""  
  
The faster pace of growth in the latest quarter might also strengthen
expectations for a rate hike by the RBI later this year. ""We expect RBI to
revise its policy stance in June and follow it up with a hike of 25 bps in
August policy,"" said Garima Kapoor, economist and vice president at Elara
Capital.  

Many economists expect India's economy to grow more than 7 per cent in
2018-19, helped by a normal monsoon and a pickup in private investment.

Though global rating agency

Moody's earlier this week

cut its GDP growth forecast for India due to higher oil prices and tighter
financial conditions, it still expects the country's GDP to expand by 7.3 per
cent this fiscal year.

GDP growth in 2018-19 could get a boost from prospects of good monsoon,
potentially brightening the outlook for agricultural output.

Economists also point out to many risk factors that could put downward
pressure on GDP growth. Possibly, the biggest risk could be rising crude oil
prices, which this month hit $80 a barrel, their highest since 2014. India
meets 80 per cent of its oil needs from imports.

Domestic

prices of petrol and diesel

are near all-time highs, putting pressure on the government to bring down
taxes on the fuels.

Rising oil prices could also weigh on the consumer demand, say economists. The
government's Economic Survey, issued in January, estimated that every $10 per
barrel rise in global oil prices cuts growth by 0.2-0.3 percentage points.

Higher crude oil prices have already hurt the rupee, which slumped to near a
record low this month. It is down about 6 per cent so far this year against
the US dollar.

__ Comments

Banking credit, a main source for corporate borrowing, has remained weak
following a surge in bad loans, as banks have been reluctant to extend new
loans. The 21 state lenders hold two-thirds of banking assets, and accounted
for the bulk of the record $150 billion of soured loans in the banking sector
in 2017.

Separately, infrastructure sector recorded a 4.7 per cent growth in April, as
against 2.6 per cent a year ago, data released by government showed.

Dr Manmohan Singh is the Real GDP King; Jaitley’s Blog cannot Change it,44,99b2zl,https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/dr-manmohan-singh-is-the-real-gdp-king-fm-jaitleys-blog-cannot-change-it,15,,thewebdev," > The Twitter hashtag #DrSinghGDPKing 

Cool. > The Modi government has once again got a panic attack. The Twitter hashtag #DrSinghGDPKing caused it. The underlying reason behind the alarming palpitations is a research panel of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation releasing a back-series adjusted GDP based on 2011-12 prices to make GDP comparisons dispassionate shorn of political googlies. This would enable holistic policy-making besides providing fodder for rigorous academic reasoning. **The Bharatiya Janata Party’s acute nervousness was on account of two manifestations of the sub-committee’s findings:**

> - 1) As expected, UPA-1 ( 2004-09) had a record-breaking five-year average GDP growth of 8.87%, an unprecedented score in India’s history.

> - 2) Even the much-maligned, badgered UPA-2 had a more impressive lead over the headline-grabbing hyperbolic NDA, 7.39% as against 7.2%.

> **Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote a hurried, poorly researched rhetorical blog**, Niti Aayog chief put out a few dubious tweets as a diversionary tactic ...

> ... Jaitley & co made an embarrassingly phlegmatic attempt to puncture UPA-1’s triumphant performance. **According to them, Dr Manmohan Singh inherited a booming 8.1% GDP growth from the Vajpayee government** in 2003-04 and just rode a providential bonanza thereafter ... **What he artfully dodges is that in the preceding year of 2001-02, the GDP had touched a nadir of 3.7% , even lower than the 3.9% of 2000-01** ... **Truth be said, NDA-1 just about averaged 5.6%**, and was easily outclassed by the formidable Dr Singh-P Chidambaram-Montek Singh Ahluwalia triumvirate.

> ... Jaitley then caustically refers to fiscal profligacy of average 5% of GDP under UPA, while selectively ignoring that under NDA-1 fiscal deficit was higher at 5.5% . That is called cherry-picking. **Under NDA-1 the average crude oil price was around $30 per barrel, while under UPA that skyrocketed to over $145 at one stage**; Jaitley has a memory loss of this stupendous escalation when discussing the inflationary impact. Yet, one of the most extraordinary accomplishments in human history happened during UPA; **poverty declined by over two-and-a-half times than under NDA and 140 million people were lifted out of poverty, the second largest ever after China.** Naturally, Jaitley did not mention this crucial statistic in India’s celebrated growth story under Dr Singh. A pity, really.

> ... **agriculture under UPA grew at an annualised 3.6%, while it was 2.2% under NDA-1.** Private consumption went up 40% faster under the UPA as did private disposable income at 20% as compared to NDA’s 8.3%. At core, **both the rural farmers and urban dwellers were better off under Dr Singh.** ...

> Jaitley is being mendacious with facts when he talks of alleged scams ... The tradition has continued in NDA-2 with Nirav Modi, Mehul Bhai Choksi and some other close buddies of the current dispensation ...

> ... **UPA-2 (7.39) has outperformed NDA-2 (7.2%) as well by a convincing margin** despite overwhelming headwinds; I list four of them.

> **First, UPA-2 faced the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007/8** which literally incinerated economies worldwide. It’s ramifications were both geographically spread (the Eurozone crisis) as well as structurally penetrative. It was the world’s most testing survival period after the Great Depression of the 1930s.

> **Secondly, oil prices reached a dizzying average of over $110 a barrel**, creating a massive pressure on current account deficit and fiscal deficit, and adding to an inflationary spiral. 

> **Third, UPA had a coalition government** and thus required circumspect calibration in policy-making which was done with adroit political maturity through consensus building. 

> **Fourth, it was actually parliamentary paralysis** (which Jaitley famously described as legitimate political strategy) forced by a belligerent BJP that created a gridlock and prevented the GST and several legislation from becoming a reality during UPA’s tenure.

> **Yet, UPA-2 has done better than NDA-2, who have had the tailwind of oil prices at $28 at one stage, low inflation, a majority government, growing world economy and above all, a strong inheritance of a robust recovering economy from the UPA-2 of 6.4%. Incidentally, UPA crossed double-digit growth rates twice during its 10-year period.** GONNA VOTE FOR CONGRESS. he is also King of Inflation.

PM Modi Asks What He Did To Deserve Insults. This Man’s Fantastic 22-Point Reply Is Going Viral,331,7jh0ie,https://www.scoopwhoop.com/pm-modi-question-answered-22-point-fb-post/#.hcpft6n9z,116,,simplysimplipal," Here you go - 


Here is a brief list to answer your question Mister Prime Minister:

1. For destroying India's economy via Demonetisation and not taking responsibility for the damage it has done.

2. For destroying the traditional plural culture of our ancient land via organised polarisation - not just religious, but also regional, linguistic and cultural.

3. For destroying the profound teachings of Hinduism/ Sanatan Dharma by placing Savarkar's fascist Hindutva as Hinduism.

4. For continuing the charade of fake nationalism when your deeds and policies are only harming India.

5. For being a government - not of India - but of Hindutva forces, crony corporations and foreign vested interests - especially the Zionist global banking cartel.

6. For false promises and falsehoods which are being spread through multiple channels everyday.

7. For violating the principles of the Indian Constitution by introducing theocratic militant nationalism and anti-privacy/ anti-freedom Aadhaar.

8. For destroying the pillars of Democracy by de-fanging media and institutions - which are critical to offer any semblance of truth and justice.

9. For not listening to people and the diversity of voices - but to impose dictates via coercion and intimidation.

10. For being anti-intellectual and actively promoting the hatred of the learned and the educated.

11. For doing all the tricks in the book to curb dissent and freedom of expression.

12. For sinking all the human development indexes since 2014.

13. For waging a fake 'morality play 'of anti-corruption crusade when the real policies of the government point to the opposite direction.

14. For hiding from unscripted questions which the people want to ask you - no single press conference since you came to power.

15. For focussing on PR, publicity, events and propaganda, but not the real issues of the nation.

16. For ruining India's traditional 'non-aligned' foreign policy.

17. For instigating the ego - hate and greed - through your theatrical 'carrot and stick' speeches.

18. For surrounding yourself with sycophants who have no talent for governance.

19. For being obsessive about grandiose ideas/ misplaced priorities and failing to deliver.

20. For misunderstanding the meaning of 'development' by neglecting social justice.

21. For being pro-super-rich and putting the poor and the Middle class under the technocratic Neoliberal Economic policies which have hollowed out the West.

22. For raging a war against India via the toxic brew of Hindutva and Neoliberalism, and destroying the people's faith and trust upon the government.

And you ask, what I have done to deserve this? Hahahahaha. Like always, Mudiji ne toh rhetoric question pucha tha. Launda serious ho gaya.

However, in my family, almost 95% of them are still pro-Modi, and they buy into each argument he makes. Each time, I try to reason with them, a staple dialogue of ""Congress ruled for 60 years, that shit can't be washed in 5 years"" is thrown around. Only the ones in Reddit, specifically r/India even talk about reason, whereas the entire community still believes in him.  chaiwala samajh nahi paayega I am from Banaras and lot of (read everyone) people in my social circle were a fan of Modi. People were hoping that he would do same to Banaras what Atal Ji did to Lucknow. They were very excited. Then I had to move to another country but when I returned back for vacations a lot of my friend were furious. They were unhappy that Modi allowed Yogi to be CM of UP. They voted for development and didn't expect such a dick move from him. We young generation from UP is really fed up with caste and religion politics. We want development and jobs. But what we got? Again same old shit. I was at least relieved that my friends are not fanboys. Some old people have also started criticizing Modi. They are also tired of religion shit and want jobs for their sons in the state.  inb4 he gets lynched, gets called out for being anti-nationalist, and is told to go to pakistan if he doesn't like it here. Modi is a chutiya of the highest order. Even if BJP wins in 2019 hope he gets kicked out along with that moron Amit Shah. > For being a government - not of India - but of Hindutva forces, crony corporations and foreign vested interests - **especially the Zionist global banking cartel**

Who is the fascist? if some muslim guy wrote this, he ll be picked up by pulis in middle of night. Agree with most but some of the points about Zionist Banking etc are just ridiculous and portrays the intellect of the writer in poor light.  He gon git arrested Ahh antisemetism looked over cause it’s anti Modi too? He can be arrested for Facebook post  Now that it's pretty evident  whose winning in Gujarat such articles would come out in full force
BTW when did Scoopwhoop become relevant ? lol, author is a conspiracy nut. Modi is supporting zionist banking cartel it seems, LOL The work that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done. I do not think so far anybody else has done the work like him. >For destroying India's economy via Demonetisation and not taking responsibility for the damage it has done.

First one. Is this true? Last numbers I heard is that Indias growth is over 6% and [is expected to continue](http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2015/01/14/india-china-gdp-growth-world-bank.jpg). Also, Chinas lead is decreasing. 

If this is economy ""destroyed"" what word is he using when growth is negative? 

Im not being facetious. Im genuinely wondering if economy is now destroyed. What are his indicators that this is the case. Seriously NAM ? Are living in sixties ? We Signed a defense cooperation treaty in 1960s which saved our ass against American nuclear missiles.

And had Israeli technology helping our army during Kargil.

The Nam countries didnt give a fuck when China attacked us in 1962.

Modi is just following what Congress was doing in 10 years who themselves were continuing the good work of Previous governments.

Criticizing the govt for it is just clueless. modi is much better than congrees if not the best.atleast he is doing something for the nation and taking risks unlike congress.
tell me a better option than bjp so that i can use my vote in a good way in 2019.

But by the promises I make in this interview. ""Don't judge me on the basis of my two biggest policy failures,"" says elected politician. Either he is a moron or he thinks his audience are morons. Oh... we forgot to congratulate the PM on his *second* ever interview in 3 years!! Round of applause people. He was finally able to make it out of his mansion to give another interview with no difficult questions! It must have been quite the task to get all the questions correct.  Did he just admit that Demonetisation was a failure? Should we then judge him on:

- Imposing an Adhaar which was meant only for public distribution service on everyone in an orwellian way.

- Having the worst record for job creation. 

- Residing over the worst private investment record since 1950's.

Edit: - A Rafale deal which was steeped in crony capitalism.

- Increasing income inequality.

- Enriching babaji's who masquerade as spiritual gurus. Providing them army to build bridges for private events and suppressing activists who protest against environmental destruction for other babaji's from the south.

- Taking advice on demonotisation from a babaji who on behalf of a quack think tank reccomended demonitisation to Mudi.

- Completley bending foreign policy to the west and not adhering to decades of non aligned status. 

- Almost selling off and destroying India's generics industry in the first 6 months of power which would have made basic drugs cost an arm and a leg to attract 'fdi' only to see a backlash.

- Completely disintegrating out military industrial complex that was on the verge of next gen technology only to buy equipment from foreign companies with zero transfer of technology so foreigners and crony capitalists can profit

- Paying zero attention to the agriculture sector which has been completely destroyed.

- Paying no attention no attention to SME sector which is dying without credit while behaving like an NRI prime minister and begging foreign firms to make in India

- Throwing Rajan out to help his crony capitalist friends; i.e so they don't have to pay back their loans

- Spending billions on novelty projects like trains while making no investments in healthcare.

- reducing healthcare spending to try turn India's healthcare into US healthcare shitty and expensive

- MP's like Mahesh Giri who were formerly with babaji's who support Modi using violence against JNU and beating women reporters and calling them anti national.

- Generally using violence as a state policy and killing judges, reporters and activists.

- Trying to destroy the judiciary and making the last institution of India the SC which is honest into a dalali organisation

- making absolutely zero economic reforms to help the common man.

- furthering Hindutva/cow politics  not Hinduism/Sanatan Dharam and sponsoring state violence against dalits.

- Opening up INdia's economy like the real estate sector and retail to foreign speculators while asking for nothing in return i.e visas or job permit increases. Which then bail out builders and destroy the economy.

- Lying about building electricity access and infrastructure at a faster pace.

- Looting money from the public through various cess's like Swach Bharat etc.

- Trying to destroy the environment in order to build infrastructure including vast tracts of forest. Ok... let's talk cow vigilantism? Or moral policing? Or hate speeches? Or rising intolerance? Or the failure of clean Ganga? Or swachh Bharat? Or let's talk about Adityanath becoming a dictator? Or the lack of a policy on Pakistan? Or China making inroads in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal?  Evaluate me on inciter, instigator, provocateur, rabble-rouser, demagoguery skills, rather. We all can judge him on throwing skills (feku). Mitron!!! Evaluate me on the unemployment crisis, the lack of private investment in the county, rising malnutrition, making AYUSH equal to allopathy (MCI Bill), supporting Aadhar after I opposed it, having biryani with China after I ridiculed my predecessor for it, the rising inflation, destroying institutions like the RTI, CEC and CVC, not appointing Lokpal after almost 4 years and renaming schemes.  Kyun behen ke loude... GST and demonitisation is what affected every common man across the country.  This clown really thinks that people have short memory spans and all.

Abki baar, u-turn waali sarkaar. Judge him for Aadhaar, Bullet Train, and Cow Vigilantes as well lol. Ummm, what about the things like cleaning Ganga, etc. that never ended up happening? There is no “allowed to keep terms” for your next 5.   There is no worse 'journalist' on TV than that prick taking the interview. Even Rajat Sharma and Arnab are better. I wonder if bhakts trying to spin this in a positive way are wondering if they are about to have  aneurism. What a retard. A couple of months ago, he was touting DeMo and GST as successes and now he just admitted to them being failures. He needs to see the latest C voter survey to rid him of the insecurities he feels. Judge me by the number of cows I have saved and the jumlas I have made. Hope someone could do epic rap battles between this guy and trump. ""Logon ke ghar main beti ki shadi hai, or paisa nahi"" ...

**Don’t evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, says PM Modi** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged the nation to not judge him only
on the basis of his decisions to implement demonetisation and GST. “Don’t
evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, we brought economic reform, built
toilets, brought electricity to 18000 villages,” PM Modi said in an exclusive
interview with Zee News.

Talking about his global approach, the Prime Minister who recently hosted his
Israeli counterpart in New Delhi and Gujarat said, “They said my understanding
was limited to Gujarat. I made it my strength. I did not follow protocol, I
was a simple man with no baggage. I made friends the world over.”

On the upcoming World Economic Forum, Modi said that the world wants to hear
“directly from the Horse’s mouth.” The PM also talked about India’s policies
and growth potential and expressed that he felt proud to represent India in
Davos.

Stating that the Indian economy is growing at a rapid pace, PM Modi said the
Davos meet is a “good opportunity” for the country as it is a big market with
the strength of demographic dividend. “The country is seeing the biggest jump
in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). It is natural that the world wants to talk
directly to India and the world wants to hear directly from the horse’s mouth
about India’s policies and potential. It matters if you hear it from the
leader,” he added.

Meanwhile, Modi also stressed on his push for conducting simultaneous polls
for Lok Sabha and state assemblies and said that like festivals it should be
held on fixed schedule.

**Modi may be the last hope for the Indian economy to achieve greatness** 

 ______ 
Recent weeks have witnessed an enormous amount of hand-wringing in the press
about India’s economy. These articles share a common thematic trajectory: they
start with a recitation of statistics that highlight a slowdown, lay it on the
doorsteps of demonetisation and GST, and in the grand tradition of the blood-
sport which is Indian politics, either use these statistics to settle personal
scores, or, as in the case of the political opposition, use it to prepare
oneself for 2019 with nervous glee. None of this hand-wringing is accompanied
with any insight or solutions beyond the obvious.

The fox knows many things. The hedgehog knows one important thing.

In a now famous essay written when he was an Oxford Don in the 1930’s, Isaiah
Berlin classified people into foxes and hedgehogs as a means of making a
distinction about people and the different ways in which they confront
reality. Foxes, according to Berlin, may know many things, but a coherent
worldview is beyond their comprehension. The hedgehog, however, knows one
great truth, and steadfast in its pursuit, remains unreconciled until he/she
reaches it.

This parable is perhaps the best way to understand Narendra Modi and his
actions surrounding the economy. Modi is the hedgehog who knows what India
needs to do to become prosperous, but importantly, is also willing to act upon
it. Indeed, he may be the only politician in contemporary Indian history who
has undertaken structural reforms out of choice rather than, like Narasimha
Rao in the 1990’s, being compelled to do so.

Structural reform is thankless: costs are borne upfront, and rewards come
later. (The currency for this transaction is political capital, and Arun
Jaitley has paid the most for his role as the able knight who is the face of
such change.) For years, it was the very absence of these structural reforms
that armchair foxes have bemoaned. Now that the reforms are occurring, the
foxes are coming out of the forest, and unwilling to pay the price, claim that
these are ill-timed, ill-conceived or ill-executed.

Through his decade-long executive leadership of one of India’s richest states,
Modi knows what the foxes don’t: First, that there’s never a right time to
make a hard choice, and second, the slowdown is the result of a fundamental
fragility of the Indian economy baked into India’s economic foundation at its
creation: the government’s overwhelming role in the economy.

Modi is seeking to eliminate this fragility by recalibrating the entire engine
of India’s economic growth methodically: Jaitley’s increasing of the states’
share in the divisible pool of union taxes in 2015,
digitisation/demonetisation of the economy in 2016, the GST in 2017, Piyush
Goyal’s work in the power sector over the last three years, Nitin Gadkari’s
ongoing work in transportation, all are transformative and quantifiable
contributors to the structure of the economy, and designed to create a robust
and higher equilibrium for the Indian economy from which it can propel itself
higher.

That these reforms are happening without any taint on any senior politician of
the government is in itself a first in India’s modern history. The republic
was lucky to survive through years of pillage under the Congress, and if it
were nothing else but just that the BJP is taint-free, we would still have
much to be thankful for.

But Modi’s toughest test is yet to come. Just as Modi fought the culture wars
and reshaped our national discourse on identity and nationhood for all time,
and just as how he is transforming India’s foreign policy through a new Modi-
doctrine, he must now dismantle the greatest vestige of Jawaharlal Nehru’s and
Indira Gandhi’s legacy: the socialist superstructure that is the curse of
India. Only when he is finished, will he have succeeded in his undeclared
personal ambition: to bury Nehru and Indira Gandhi forever.

To do so involves treating the economic organisation of a society not merely
in transactional terms, but as a moral issue inextricably linked to individual
rights and dignity, and moving wholeheartedly towards the only economic system
that provides for such: a free-market system adapted to help those on India’s
economic margins.

In doing so, he would do well to reduce his reliance on ever wiser economic
councils and bureaucrats, but follow his hedgehog instincts which have yielded
such sharp results in foreign policy and India’s culture wars. (As an aside, I
note with some amusement a lesson from my first class in economics with
Professor Jagdish Bhagwati: “India did so badly in the 50’s and 60’s not
because it had too few economists, but because it had too many!”)

This then, is the call to arms. In addition to a dogged focus on anti-
corruption (a necessary issue for 2014 but insufficiently ambitious for 2019),
Modi needs to speak to the country in civilisational terms about the manner of
its economic organisation, and seek the mandate to put the nation on the path
to double-digit growth for decades to come.

In practical terms, and as a first step, it requires the sale of the
government-owned banks and PSU’s in their entirety. Not re-capitalisation, not
mere NPA-resolution, not partial-disinvestment of loss-making PSU’s etc. A
complete sale. These are giant black holes that destroy capital, or at best,
use it sub-optimally. Modi cannot rebuild a nation without removing the
termites from its foundation.

By seizing the time still available in 2017-2019 (and perhaps for five years
thereafter), Modi may still live up to his own revolutionary declaration of
2014: “Government has no role in business”. Modi may represent the last best
hope for the Indian economy to achieve true greatness. If Modi doesn’t do it
now, India will be condemned to this middling, snakes-and-ladder growth
pattern for another several generations.

If not Modi, then who? If not now, then when?

The hedgehog knows.

[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,158,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,82,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",ringtring," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India. It's just 24 minutes(skip the first 2 minutes of intro) and really goes into depth, yet in an accessible way. 

https://youtu.be/qAuBZQNpOV4?t=2m53s Since East Asia was mentioned... bit off-topic but can someone ELI5 how Japan became such a developed country after US completely fucked them over with the Tokyo firebombing and atomic bombings? What the fuck is happening today, back-to-back quality posts.

Strategy 6: Create a technology platform that enables startup and SME growth. 


 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.  ",Policy/Economy,2017-04-22 12:19:09
Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud,96,6c2b6n,http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/modis-approach-to-china-has-done-us-proud-1695284,62,,Bennelong," Is BARF really the abbreviation for it? Lmao ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**Opinion: Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government's decision to not send an envoy to China's big
Belt and Road Forum (abbreviated, incredibly, BARF) has been the cause of much
wailing and gnashing of teeth in New Delhi. Given the fact that India is
practically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that
dozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of
their governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government
deliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as
stubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.

Well, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign
policy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on
grounds that are both principled and realist.

The government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-
articulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that
""connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility
to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;
balanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;
transparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to
help long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local
communities."" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the
path of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-
initiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were
clearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the
sustainability issues involved.

While India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it
is not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The
Guardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the
resolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental
reasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of
""isolation"" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign
up to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India
is the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the
subject, and of that we can be proud.

Let's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take
advantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free
country and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian
manufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by
China, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.
It is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what
OBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own
position in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will
not, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in
particular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on
infrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS
Bank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.
This is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently
violate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would
fail to uphold.

This is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has
taken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In
almost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of
Manmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in
such matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the
Singh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's
sensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:
Beijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's ""core
interests"". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to
the Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-
II, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact
with Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would
also have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit
from the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's
sensitivities.

By taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi
has done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand
on a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.

There are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is
essentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and
economics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a
leader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an
alternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-
driven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's
America turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free
movement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles
everywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.

And second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this
regard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which
serve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries
and economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,
Singapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.

Modi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning
to deliver. He must keep going.

**It’s time Modi government stopped blaming RBI** 

 ______ 
Overall, the Narendra government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Photo: PTI

Before the six-member committee that sets monetary policy for the Reserve Bank of India met this week, the government in New Delhi made its preferences very clear. Two members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic advisory council—a body that he did without for a long time, but which was recently reconstituted following several policy stumbles—publicly declared that real interest rates were too high. But the RBI committee held firm and kept India’s policy interest rate at six percent.

This could have been, and was, predicted. India’s central bank is now officially supposed to be targeting consumer price inflation and nothing else; the government agreed to this change over a year ago. And inflation has been inching up, driven by higher prices for food and fuel. In October, consumer price inflation was the highest in seven months.

Formal requirements apart, of course, it would’ve been hard for the central bank to ignore the government’s pleas if the economy were stalled. But the government achieved something of a victory last week when GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017 came in at 6.3%, slightly faster than in the first quarter. That eliminated pressure on the RBI to cut rates and stimulate investment. Instead, the central bank’s priority is guarding against the possibility that higher growth will begin to affect wages—and, in particular, real estate prices, which the RBI singled out for attention in its policy statement.

This illustrates the government’s great dilemma. Growth in India never quite slows down enough to make crisis measures necessary. Yet it never quite speeds up enough to satisfy the aspirations of Modi, his party and his voters (not to mention his critics). The couple things the government has gotten right in the past few months—its attempts to streamline the new goods-and-services tax and its determined approach to cleaning up distressed assets—haven’t been dramatic enough either to ease the RBI’s worries or to push the economy to a permanently higher growth path.

Overall, this government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Now it’s clear that the RBI won’t bail it out; the best chance for lower rates may have passed. Any revival of private investment—which, as a proportion of GDP, was even lower in the second quarter than the first—will have to come from somewhere else.

Frankly, if the government is serious about a growth revival, it will have to return to the drawing board. It still has time and political capital to spare before it has to face the voters in 2019. There is an entire set of reforms that it hasn’t touched since its first few months in power: to India’s problematic labour markets, for example, or to the ways available to industry and developers to acquire agricultural land.

Recently, India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, insisted that India would become a $10-trillion dollar economy by 2030. That would mean moving toward double-digit growth in dollar terms very soon. Yet there’s no indication of that on the horizon. Frankly, the signs to me aren’t propitious. While the growth slowdown may have reversed, part of that was simply a dead-cat bounce. Manufacturers who had stopped production to de-stock before the introduction of the new GST started up again in the second quarter. That’s hardly sustainable.

Nor is the government capable of intervening itself to prop up growth. In fact, it’s running out of money to keep stimulating the economy: It has already run through most of its fiscal deficit cushion for the year, and the RBI flagged the fiscal stresses caused by higher pay for government employees and Indian states’ mad competition to forgive agricultural debt. Nor are there really any signs, even anecdotally, of renewed investment in India’s private sector.

It’s hard to see 6.3% growth as a major achievement in India. As the RBI pointed out, it’s not a disaster. But, if the government is honest with itself, it’s not a triumph either. It’s time that Modi, his ministers and his advisers turned to the many reforms they’ve left pending—and stopped blaming the RBI. Bloomberg View

If economic policies are managed well India will be a powerhouse economy, IMF
has said

**Washington: **

India can become a powerhouse economy if policies are managed well and reforms
are supportive of inclusive growth, a top IMF official has said.

David Lipton, the International Monetary Fund's First Deputy Managing
Director, also expressed hope that India's growth will be reflected in poverty
reduction statistics and eventually in a measurement of metrics of inclusion.

""If policies are managed well and reforms are supportive of inclusive growth,
India's economy could become a powerhouse economy. It is already, I think the
10th largest, but with the population and the growth rate there's more
potential,"" he told news agency PTI.

""I've said there's more to be done. There are further reforms both in terms of
consolidating the budget situation to ensure that there's never an incident of
doubt about fiscal finances in terms of making the banking system more
competitive and dealing with the legacy problems of NPAs (non- performing
assets),"" he said.

He said the important job was not just to recapitalise, but to change the
governance and change the competitiveness so that banks serve as a positive
force by allocating credit well and being a driving force in the economy .

__ Comments

Asked about IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde's remarks that she does
not expect any major economic reforms in an election year, Mr Lipton said:
""It's always a difficult to make policy during election years.

""We certainly hope that there can continue to be a progress, but it's really
the judgement of the politicians, the government about what can be done when"".

**Have to take temporary pain for long-term gain: VP Venkaiah Naidu on economy** 

 ______ 
Venkaiah Naidu said that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned. (File photo) Venkaiah Naidu said that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned. (File photo)

At a time when the Narendra Modi-led central government is battling a public perception of economic mismanagement, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu on Friday threw his weight behind the present dispensation and said the country has to face temporary pain for long-term gain.

“The temporary things… there will be some problem. Of course, you have to take temporary pain for long term gain. I am not getting into this arena. There are other people who are debating, using their skills, forgetting what they have done, what has to be done, what needs to be done,” Vice President Naidu said.

The Vice-President also stated that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned.

Maintaining that even China is witnessing a slowdown in its economy, Naidu said that the global economy has slowed down and added that India remains a bright spot”in the midst of this”.

His reaction comes days after senior BJP leader and former finance minister Yashwant Sinha launched an attack on the government over handling of the economy. Sinha in his article in The Indian Express had blamed Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for the “mess” in the economy. He wrote that the economy is in a downward spiral, its revival unlikely by the 2019 elections and a “hard landing appears inevitable.

Later in the day, at a book launch event in New Delhi, Naidu talked on several issues. On terrorsim he said, “Terrorism has no religion, caste, creed.”

He further said, “Religion is used to mislead the younger generation, we should be wary of this. We should educate and enlighten people on evil effects of terrorism, how much it costs. Every country should speak in one voice. Political parties within the country also should speak with one voice, they shouldn’t try to score brownie political points.”

Naidu said, “Bullet can never bring change. If even if it brings change temporarily, it will not sustain. It is the ballot which is powerful than bullet in democracy, that has been proven. The society should discourage acts by people taking to arms and then trying to achieve there state political goal.”

Booster shot for economy: GST rates to be cut on 60 goods and services.,93,74kzl4,http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/gst-council-set-to-ease-processes-for-smes-on-friday-2405561.html,14,,appu_or," Behn ... maslaa rate ka nahi, GST ke rule aur infrastructure ka hai. But wasn't there nothing wrong with the economy as the government insisted? Then why these changes? How many fucking changes will these clowns make? One of the big confusion going on already is regarding different tax rates for products and this is going to get a whole lot worse when tax slabs for 60 more products are changed. Then there are million other doubts regarding actual filing, refund, exports, website acting wonky, zero support from CBEC etc 

The sheer number of changes that have to be done on this half baked tax regime shows how poorly it was conceptualised and implemented. It feels as if someone who has no idea how the country's economy works sat down and came up with the garbage known as GST act. 

Mudi and Jaitley should be ashamed and issue an unconditional apology to corporate India. Shame on these chaiwalas and morons   You still have to file 3 times a month and get extremely confused as you try to figure out the rate for various good. Its been 3 fucking years since gst bill was introduced in parliament and another couple since it was proposed by UPA, why is it so fucking hard to come up with a sane and sensible taxes You know what is worse than impractical draconian rules and business breaking taxes??

Uncertainty. If the above is cancer, but Uncertainty is basically a bullet to the head. 

MSMEs don't have a legal team to go through all the everchanging rules. You motherfuckers  should understand we have other responsibilities and headaches to operate our businesses. You have all the resources one could get and still can't come up with a reasonable policy after multiple meetings.

That's like saying calculus is very important and forcing children to learn it without teaching them algebra.  Even Muslims are turning into Modi agents. Their bhakti knows no bounds. /s this can not b digested by modi bashers A cashless economy is the ONLY way to win the war on black money.  Demonitization attacks stores of existing cash and forces people to learn new methods of payments.  But in the long term, it is only when the government can track each and every transaction that a person makes at the click of a button that the capacity to generate future black money will be drastically reduced.  (and yes, I'm ignoring other benefits of cashless economy such as lack of printing/storage/productivity wasted by getting and storing cash, etc)

Of course he is going to say cashless economy is a boon - Any economist who says going cashless for is bad is a fucking moron. Cashless economy is a boon however shoving it down people's throat by a democratic government isn't. The large majority of those bearing the brunt of demonetization policies are precisely the ones that aren't paying their legal share of taxes regardless of the infrastructure and systems that do facilitate their livelihoods. We live in a country where tax administration only reaches a small fraction of the population.

I'm not accusing them, I'm merely stating a fact. Having lived income-tax-free for decades means they've paid less than their expected share toward national interest. Subsequently having to change money and lose a sum in the transaction one day, or having to suffer the inconvenience of setting up a bank account isn't an unreasonable consequence. 

Many of them are poor but taxes are in some sense an investment for our peoples' future; having a functional society or lift hundreds of millions from poverty will require a budget. Generally speaking, we can have a drawn-out process of social and technological modernization and prolong poverty, or we can do more in shorter order with more resources. This is not something to be contested, this is all obvious, yet people will waste time arguing even the most basic logic.

We should be as creative as we can in our solutions to mitigate the costs of modernization. But there are few low-hanging fruit that will effect meaningful reform on national scale. It is true, one such demonetization even will not break the effect of black money on India; but as one piece of commitment to a multi-pronged, long-term strategy, we can make it work.

The key has to be that someone does something. Government in India often does not meet even this most basic requirement with respect to facilitating our social or technological development. We can argue day and night about everything, always starting from square one, always starting from the most basic philosophical assumptions, but we're guaranteed nothing will change if nothing is attempted.
Perhaps Modi has not done everything he could or should, maybe we can question his motives all day and night, but he has begun doing something, taking some calculated, novel risk, to produce national momentum. He has justified his own salary in some small way.

No one is opposing cashless but opposing the Govts BS on how fast India can become cashless and the propaganda they are engaging in.

India not China is among the fastest growing economies,60,6ntezq,http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-china-fastest-growing-economies-world-bank/1/1004183.html,24,,aryaninvader," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**India not China is among the fastest growing economies** 

 ______ 
The latest World Bank report about the economic health of the member countries clearly says that while India is among the fastest growing economies - big and small, China is not doing as well.

Chinese economy is slowing down. In its latest report, the World Bank has said, ""The continued gradual slowdown in China will slightly offset a pickup in the rest of the region led by a rebound among commodity exporters. Growth in China is anticipated to slow to 6.5 percent this year and 6.3 percent in 2018.""

According to the World Bank's latest edition of the Global Economic Prospects, India is the fourth fastest growing economy in the world. China shows a clear sign of slowdown and ranks at number 16 in terms of GDP growth rate.

INDIA PICKING UP

The World Bank has pegged India's growth rate at 7.2 for the current year on the back of rising export and increase in government spending.

Writing in the June edition of the Global Economic Prospects, the The World Bank analysts said, ""In India, recent data indicate an acceleration in growth, with an easing of cash shortages and a rise in exports. An increase in government spending, including on capital formation, has partially offset soft private investment.""

According to the World Bank, ""India is expected to accelerate to 7.2 per cent in fiscal 2017 (April 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018) and 7.5 per cent in the following fiscal year. Domestic demand is expected to remain strong, supported by policy reforms.""

CHINA SLIPS

In terms of growth rate, India is placed behind smaller economies of Estonia, Uzbekistan and Nepal. On the other hand, China failed to secure a place in the top 15 economies in terms of GDP growth rate.

The World Bank said, that though China has shown recovery in exports and the robust consumption pattern has helped it grow at 6.9 per cent in the first quarter, Beijing's slowdown is pulling down the east Asian region. Other countries in the region are showing better growth rates.

The World Bank has also expressed concern about exacerbating financial vulnerabilities of China on account of ""elevated domestic debt.""

According to the World Bank, the policy uncertainty in the United States and Europe is likely to impact Chinese growth rate more adversely. The trade, immigration and fiscal policies of the US are under review by the Donald Trump administration.

Similarly, the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union carries financial risks that could weigh on heavily on the China's growth prospects.

I think between SC and Modi, the latter is still wiser at the moment no matter what your standings leanings are. You might not agree with demonetization.

Fitch also warned that large stock of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets could dampen the outlook for credit growth and business investment. File photo: Bloomberg

New Delhi: Fitch Ratings has lowered India’s economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 6.9% from 7.4% after the gross domestic product (GDP) growth “unexpectedly faltered” in the April-June quarter.

The credit rating agency said however that it expects the economic activity to accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year with the waning impact of one-off events including the demonetisation shock in late 2016 and the goods and services tax (GST) rollout in July, which had dampened growth in the short term.

“The large stock of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets could, however, dampen the outlook for credit growth and business investment,” Fitch Ratings in its latest global economic outlook (GEO). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) had last month slashed India’s GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7% from 7.4% owing to weakness in private consumption, manufacturing output and business investment.

India had posted a 7.1% growth in 2016-17. ADB pencilled in 7.4% for 2018-19, down from the earlier forecast of 7.6% in July. Fitch Ratings said the global economy has improved markedly this year and is on course to recording its fastest expansion since 2010.

India’s GDP growth at 5.7% in the first quarter (April-June), down from 6.1% in the previous year, is “the lowest outturn since early 2013, and GDP has now been cooling for five consecutive quarters”, it said. Economic activity in the quarter, it said, may have been disrupted by firms running down inventory ahead of the implementation of the GST in July.

The manufacturing sector lost steam in the quarter, growing at a meagre 1.2% year-on-year. The primary sector also dampened growth, while construction and tertiary activity bounced back. On the expenditure side, net trade was a big drag on growth, with exports decelerating sharply (after an admittedly strong January-March print) and import growth remaining buoyant (at 13.4% year-on-year).

“In light of the poor 1H17 (first half of 2017) outturns, we have downgraded our forecast for FY17-18 (year-ending March 2018) to 6.9 per cent, a cut of 0.5 percentage points compared to the June GEO,” Fitch said.

Forecasting acceleration in activity in the second half of the current fiscal, it said consumption should drive the pick-up in growth. “Motorcycle sales — a good indicator of rural household consumption — have gained strong momentum, bouncing back in July and August after having fallen sharply in 1H17. Investment is also expected to tick up in the quarters ahead, in part bolstered by ramped-up public sector infrastructure spending,” Fitch said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its policy rate to 6% in August, resuming the monetary easing cycle initiated in early 2015. “However, monetary policy loosening has taken place in the context of rapidly falling inflation, implying that the RBI’s policy stance as measured by the real policy rate has not been so accommodative,” it added.

The global economy has improved markedly this year but the current favourable mix of strong growth and highly accommodative macro policies could be as good as it gets, it said. “Our forecasts imply something of a ‘sweet spot’ for the global economy in 2017 and 2018 with above-trend growth and still highly accommodative global monetary policies. However, this is not a pattern we expect to persist into 2019 and beyond as output gaps close in advanced economies and monetary policy support is withdrawn,” said Brian Coulton, Fitch’s chief economist.

Global growth has been upgraded to 3.1% in 2017 from 2.9% in June, and 2018 growth has been upgraded to 3.2% from 3.1%.

Jagdish Bhagwati, Pravin Krishna,Suresh SundaresanOn November 8 Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a surprise reform to the nation: the government declared that the high-denomination 500 and 1000 rupee notes, which constituted more than 85% of currency outstanding in value, would be invalid as legal tender and could only be deposited into bank accounts until the end of the year.This is a courageous and substantive economic reform that, despite the significant transition costs, has the potential to generate large future benefits.



This is a courageous and substantive economic reform that, despite the significant transition costs, has the potential to generate large future benefits.India is largely a cash-driven economy, though a rapidly growing percentage of the population is becoming tech savvy. A shadow economy reliant on cash transactions and evading taxes, especially on high value transactions such as real estate purchases, gold, and intrinsically illegal activity, has taken deep and highly persistent root. Counterfeiting of Indian rupee notes and their subsequent use in funding of terrorist activities has also been an important concern.

Undertaking this reform has required the political courage to impose predictable transition costs on the economy to lay the foundation for sustained future benefits – the converse of what one normally expects from one’s politicians.

This is incorrect, as the policy allows for the exchange of old notes for new notes. Although the process is inconvenient, and subjects many households to hardships, it forces the cash from the black economy to be deposited into the banking system, potentially increasing transparency and expanding the tax base and revenues to the government from taxes and surcharges.

The argument that the policy is anti-poor is suspect as a significant fraction of the taxes and surcharges that will be collected from the reform initiative is to be allocated to social programmes.

On the contrary, this action has been taken by duly elected officials within the framework of a democracy.To be effective, the policy required an element of surprise. Given this surprise factor and the magnitude of the reform, the rollout of the policy has generated predictable hardships.The shortage of new currency notes and limits on withdrawals has led to considerable anxiety about wage and pension payments, and cash financing of even routine household expenditures. The frequent changes in rules during the past month, over how money deposited into accounts will be taxed, how much money may be withdrawn and which exemptions would apply, for instance, have led to unnecessary confusion.

Several recent developments suggest that the demonetisation drive may well yield significant benefits.First, around 80% of the currency in higher denominations has now been deposited back into bank accounts. Since individual deposits will now be matched with their tax returns and unaccounted deposits will be taxed, this will yield a windfall for the government permitting large increases in social expenditures.

**Living in denial** 

 ______ 
The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so. The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so.

Delhi’s denials of reality would be funny if it weren’t for the tragic consequences. On the economy, this denial dates back to 2012 when Manmohan Singh was in charge and Rahul Gandhi has only now underlined that unemployment was the problem. Yashwant Sinha has edited a book on The Future of the Indian Economy and documented the continuing crisis.

Employment is only a part of the story. Arvind Panagariya was more direct. The corporate sector has performed well, he said. Investment output and employment have been rising. He took averages to make comparisons, which is not good statistics for analysis of short-run changes, for if there are three numbers 5, 10 and 15, the average is 5 but there is wild oscillation. Panagariya has written a good book on the Indian economy but he is not a great statistician. His use of averages to force the argument that the blip last year and this year will be reversed is flawed. Fortunately, his successor, Rajiv Kumar, says it is difficult but doable.

The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so. The economy decelerated and voters correctly placed the blame on the UPA government and voted it out. Rahul Gandhi is absolutely correct in accepting the mistake on behalf of the then ruling party and saying that it needs to be corrected. Panagariya is too good an economist to ignore the non-corporate sector and its importance in the economy when the corporate sector is less than a tenth of the economy. In terms of output and employment, the non-corporate sector is important because jobs are created there. But for the sake of debating points, the fact that the national accounts data doesn’t show a rosy picture and includes performance of the non-corporate sector, was slurred over. Yashwant Sinha has also started a debate and in a piece in these columns established that the reversal of the slowdown was simply not there.

S. Gurumurthy had the courage to say that since Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s days, employment has been on the back burner. Half a problem is solved if a mistake is admitted and an amendment is made. But the empire struck back. On Rahul, a commentator close to the establishment said that speeches in America won’t matter in eastern UP. Another said that Berkeley and the Ivy League schools don’t matter. I went to the University of Pennsylvania, and also taught there, including at Wharton and Swarthmore College. Working as I do in Gujarat from 1968, I hold the motel owner-NRIs in high esteem. Many are engineers and so on, who went into motels since other options were not there when they settled in America, and being intelligent and well-trained, made a success of them. But the Ivy League and the professional crowd is also important, have strong connections at home and their opinion is respected in India. In fact, they remain more often than not more connected with India than the motel NRIs and so should definitely not be ignored.

Sinha asked the beleaguered establishment to get back to the drawing board. One commentator strangely argued that he was wrong because real rural wages have been rising. Abhijit Sen, now back at JNU, had pointed out a decade ago that the rural wage rate is rising but unemployment is there in a big way. This conundrum needs to be worked on rather than being wished away. Another commentator was to argue that imports are rising so Sinha must be wrong, but we are a continental economy. A senior minister could only abuse Sinha; strange since the finance and planning ministries have been known for their professional stance.

One can only hope that the policy response will be more professional. The so-called stimulus package should not just give us lectures on reform. Someday, we will get to one or maybe two rates and have a real GST, which then, after six months, will start working. Until then, we can call it a GST but with five rates it’s not unlike a sales tax. Some day, the demonetisation effects will wear off. Also please don’t end it all by telling the ministries to spend more efficiently based on existing financial allocations. If reports are correct, the captive secretary saying ‘yes sir’ must have gone out sniggering.

Efficiency doesn’t improve by lectures. Assuming that working styles will remain more or less the same, design a real stimulus. If you do your job and raise demand, the economy will respond magnificently.

India’s Demonetization Debacle,76,5it1gn,http://www.wsj.com/articles/indias-demonetization-debacle-1481851086,18,,abhishekraghunath," In case of paywall

____________________________________________________

Nearly six weeks after India abruptly scrapped high-denomination banknotes accounting for about 85% of its currency by value, the economy continues to slow. Poor and middle-class Indians are still suffering from the shortage of new bills. But the most significant casualty may well be Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reputation as a sound economic manager.

On Nov. 8, Mr. Modi announced that India’s two highest-denomination currency bills—1,000 rupees ($14.84) and 500 rupees—would immediately cease to be legal tender in most places. Holders have until the end of the year to deposit these bills into bank accounts. As replacements, the government has slowly rolled out a redesigned 500-rupee bill and a new 2,000-rupee bill.

The long-term effects of India’s demonetization gambit remain unclear, largely because no other major economy has attempted such an experiment except during a crisis. But with growth slowing and job losses rising, the short-term prognosis appears grim.

Instead of factory openings or large new investments, the images that tell India’s current economic story include snaking lines outside banks, distressed workers migrating back to their villages, and tax raids on jewelers and officials caught with hoards of allegedly illicit cash.

The policy’s shabby implementation—through an avalanche of amendments, rollbacks and patchwork fixes—undercuts Mr. Modi’s reputation for quiet efficiency. It also underscores his overreliance on India’s notoriously heavy-handed bureaucrats.

Demonetization has resurrected fears that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party takes policy advice from quacks. It damaged the credibility of India’s central bank. And it forced many of the country’s ostensibly right-of-center intellectuals to perform advanced mental gymnastics to defend the prime minister. Though a few economists have applauded Mr. Modi, the weight of informed opinion leans heavily against his decision.

Not surprisingly, shock waves from the announcement continue to crash through the economy. The Asian Development Bank cut its growth estimate for India for the financial year ending March 31 to 7% from 7.4%. JP Morgan expects growth to decline by half a percent to 6.7%.

Meanwhile, falling sales have begun to translate into layoffs spanning various sectors, including construction, textiles and jewelry. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy estimates the transaction costs alone of swapping out an estimated 14.2 trillion rupees’ worth of currency to be 1.28 trillion rupees, or about $19 billion.

India’s economy will eventually recover from this self-inflicted wound, but there’s no question that demonetization has created doubts about Mr. Modi’s competence. The decision, reportedly hatched in secret with a coterie of trusted bureaucrats, showcases the prime minister’s faith in the command-and-control ethos of the civil service rather than in the “minimum government” he once promised.

It also shows how susceptible Mr. Modi and his aides are to the unorthodox ideas of assorted cranks and oddballs from the Hindu nationalist movement to which the BJP belongs. The loudest backers of demonetization include a telegenic yoga guru, a chartered accountant best known for propounding the homespun economic philosophy of “swadeshi,” or self-reliance, and a nongovernmental organization that wants almost all taxes to be replaced by a single levy on bank transactions.

Already, a flurry of commentary by well-regarded Indian and global commentators has tarnished the prime minister’s image. The business journalist T.N. Ninan calls demonetization “a bad idea, badly executed on the basis of some half-baked notions.” For Morgan Stanley’s Ruchir Sharma, Mr. Modi’s “clumsy exercise of state power” won’t achieve its ostensible aim—cracking down on so-called “black money” salted away by tax dodgers. Kaushik Basu, a former chief economic advisor to the government of India and former chief economist at the World Bank, calls the policy “poorly designed, with scant attention paid to the laws of the market.”

To be sure, not everyone thinks demonetization is a disaster. Columbia University’s Jagdish Bhagwati calls it “a courageous and substantive economic reform” whose potential benefits include shrinking the shadow economy, hurting terrorists and counterfeiters, and expanding the tax base by digitizing many economic transactions.

Others argue that this is likely only the first of a series of reforms that will eventually simplify tax administration, root out corruption and make campaign finances more transparent. Some supporters view demonetization as a quick way to invigorate a sluggish banking sector with cheap funds.

Perhaps the optimists will be proved right, but at this point their gauzy hopes of future benefits must be weighed against the present pain. Even if demonetization ends up producing some gains, the question of whether it was worth its considerable costs will linger. Moreover, the simple fact that no credible expert suggested such a drastic policy before Mr. Modi announced it makes many arguments in its support look like belated apologia.

Two and a half years ago, based on his record as the business-friendly chief minister of Gujarat, Mr. Modi stormed to national power as India’s great economic hope. At least for now, the demonetization debacle has shaken this assumption to its foundations.

Time to bury the myth of competent Modi once and for all. Modi is totally out of his depth ffs. He's so incompetent. This is some Rahul Gandhi level shit Modi will probably start a war with Pakistan soon to distract everyone. The country’s bungling effort to cut down on cash has undermined Narendra Modi’s credibility, says Sadanand Dhume in The Wall Street Journal.

No wonder garibi did not get removed.

Guess people who throw the word jumla for Modi/BJP forget the mother of all jumlas. Bhai the 'i' at the end of garibi was a spelling error

It was supposed to be 'garib hatao' Obviously. Anyone who looked past the 'pro-poor' rhetoric and actually looked at how India's socialist system worked could see why it couldn't remove poverty: In the name of 'equality' it concentrated all of India's resources in the hands of a small elite of government officials and chosen industrialists.

On 19 November, the Congress party kick-started celebrations to commemorate the birth centenary year of Indira Gandhi (hereafter referred to as Gandhi).

At a time when BJP is championing the image of prime minister Narendra Modi as a strong and decisive leader, the Congress party would be hoping to use Gandhi’s legacy to counter the ruling party and prime minister.

In an interview to India Today Television, Congress president Sonia Gandhi dismissed theories which equate Narendra Modi and Gandhi. While there is nothing new in the political slugfest being played out, a more interesting question is how should one evaluate Gandhi’s economic policies?

To analyse the performance of the Indian economy under Gandhi’s leadership, we have divided the post-independence period into three parts: 1952-1966, 1966-1984 and 1984 onwards. Gandhi was the prime minister from 1966-84 barring the period from 1977-1980. A simple comparison of growth rates shows that agricultural growth under Indira Gandhi’s tenure is the highest India has ever achieved. While overall growth rates have increased overtime in India, industry’s performance was the worst during Gandhi’s tenure.

In terms of per capita incomes, India started lagging behind China and southeast Asia when Gandhi was at the helm of affairs.

Gandhi’s own political rhetoric was more tilted towards providing a welfare state rather than delivering high growth, exemplified in her coining of the slogan Garibi Hatao (Eradicate Poverty). A reading of multiple Indian poverty estimates shows that poverty has declined at a much faster rate in post-reform India despite the dismantling of many of Gandhi’s policies. To be sure, there is a big debate on whether India’s current poverty lines guarantee adequate consumption and well-being levels. However, there is a broad agreement on the fact that poverty has declined faster in post-Gandhi India.

One statistic, which underlines the need for exercising caution vis-à-vis the positive picture painted by declining poverty figures is the rapid rise in inequality in India in the post-reform period. In fact, India was a more equal society than southeast Asia during Gandhi’s period. This trend has reversed itself today.

If there is one policy implemented by Gandhi which has left the most enduring impact on India’s political economy, it is the nationalisation of banks, which created a huge public sector bank network in India. The process was accomplished in two stages, first in 1969 and later in 1980.

Public sector banks have played a major role in the current problem of bad loans which plagues the Indian economy. Given the nexus between politicians controlling banks and businessmen, bank nationalisation policy is seen as a major culprit for the bad loan problem facing the Indian economy today. Public sector rigidities have also been seen as an obstacle to hiring talented executives and improving efficiency in India’s state owned banks.

However, it is also a fact that nationalisation of banks helped in furthering financial inclusion and improved access to institutional credit for people who did not have access to it earlier. Financial intermediation increased sharply in the post-nationalisation period. The state-led expansion of banking also helped in a doubling of savings rate in the economy from 10 percent in 1970s to 20% in 1980s. An increase in savings rate is seen as a crucial requirement for increasing investment and growth rate in any economy.

Caution should be observed in a mechanical reading of the statistics cited above as many policies often affect the economy with a lag. In fact, various economists have pointed towards the need to understand the complexities of political economy factors which drove economic growth in India. A 2004 National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working paper by Harvard economist Dani Rodrik and India’s Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian argues that the pro-business shift in Gandhi’s policies post 1980 was crucial in the growth rate picking up in the Indian economy. Similarly, a 2003 paper by Niti Aayog’s vice chairman Arvind Panagariya argues that acceleration in India’s GDP growth occurred during India’s fifth five year plan period (1974-79), while underlining the fact that growth revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s was more volatile in nature than the post-reform period.

At a time when India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, it is to be expected that the incumbent regimes would claim credit for the economic performance and dismiss the socialist rhetoric of the past of which Gandhi is an important icon.

However, it also remains a fact that despite faster growth, India stills lags behind most peers in human development outcomes.

The economic boom in southeast Asia and China helped these countries to significantly improve their human development indicators. Today, these countries are significantly ahead of India in terms of health and education levels. In fact, this gap started widening during the period when Gandhi was in power (see chart above). It remains to be seen whether a shift from Congress’s Garibi Hatao to Modi’s Cash Hatao will break this jinx.

The journey of India’s GDP from 1000 A.D. to 2020,49,4zc42a,http://qz.com/764352/the-journey-of-indias-gdp-from-1000-a-d-to-2020/,30,,User_Name13," In the year 1700 accounted 24.4% of global GDP. 

By 1950 we were down to 4.2% of global GDP.

And we bottomed out in 1979 with 3% of global GDP.

My beef with this article is that it doesn't even mention Manmohan Singh and completely glosses over the monumental 1991 economic liberisation reforms. Singh set the stage for someone like Modi to become PM and continue the work increasing India's share of global GDP. 

Singh had to do battle with the License Raj, before Singh did away with the old License Raj system, it was almost impossible for even an upper-middle class Indian to become a successful entrepreneur. 

My point is without Singh, you don't get a Modi.  The article is peddling the myth that Indian decline began under the British. This is a lie. India's decline *continued* under the British. India would not have been taken over by the Brits if its decline had not started earlier, thereby making it weak, thus making it easier to conquer.

Indian GDP per capita was already declining by the time the British came. [Look at the change from 1600 to 1700](http://tinyurl.com/gurlh3p).

Other than this annoying habit, the article mostly says what is obvious, India will return to its rightful place in the coming decades at the forefront of economic might. Till about 300 years ago, India accounted for more than a quarter of the world's GDP. This share began falling following the advent of British power over the subcontinent.

Just look at the population share of Asia (which is basically China + India) in this chart - http://i.imgur.com/ZqJhbeg.png

Look at this chart which shows the GDP share of each region - http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-20%20at%209.37.55%20AM.png and sum the India + China shares of GDP.

Until the 18th century, it has consistently been 65 to 70% of the world share.

It was only until the 1700s onwards when industrialization and colonialism started taking off that the GDP shares started diverging from the world share.

To summarize - we were never an economic superpower in the agrarian world which existed from 1000s to 1700s. In fact, it is highly unlikely we that we ever had the same position that USA does now in modern history.

it will not end happily, i assure you.  The article did not mention the role of Govt. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW5FRuMkQ6g That's the classical liberal or libertarian point of view, espoused by the Chicago School of Economics. That would be minarchism, neo-liberalism isn't necessarily the Austrian school.  This isn't really a question for economists but more for political scientists, but that's just semantics. 

Neo-liberal refers to the 'original' liberalism, that is the liberalism that developed during the 17th-18th century that advocated for government to have limited power and to vest greater power in the individual. Theoretically this means the government serves as minimal a role as possible- upholding laws through courts and police forces, providing national defence, etc.

The issue is that 'law and order' as 'justice' are broad terms that aren't clearly defined. For instance, you can and people have argued that banning alcohol is a government move to uphold law and order, as less drunkards will cause trouble or beat their wives or commit assault. You can argue that reservation policies are a policy to uphold justice, to correct the injustice of generations of caste discrimination and such. 

Naturally neo-liberalism vests a lot of power and freedom in the private sector. That said, anti-trust and pro-competition regulations are another key role for the government to play.  When Jhootly and call drop mantri fails to auction spectrum to its potential and loot the exchequer. /s Govt Role - Providing basic services like public transport,good roads, water and electricity (which can be contracted to private players) and govt. schools and maybe govt. universities

State Govt. - Law and order, ensuring the above services are delivered, fund state universities and ensure facilitation of economic growth by removing roadblocks for businesses, slash redtape, repeal redundant state laws and enforce the laws.

All other economic activity like running companies must be done by private players. That's the conservative way of thinking, not liberal.",Policy/Economy,2016-11-07 17:49:50

**Moving towards an investment revival** 

 ______ 
Is corporate investment finally stirring to life? There are now a few silver
linings in what continues to be a dark sky. These rays of hope deserve more
attention than they are getting right now.

In its latest monetary policy statement released in early February, the
monetary policy committee of the Indian central bank said, as part of its
comments on the outlook for the Indian economy, that there are early signs of
“a revival in investment activity”. The panel that sets interest rates
believes the revival in global demand should help strengthen domestic
investment. Earlier, the World Bank had said in its June update on the global
economy that gross domestic capital formation—or investment—would overtake
private consumer spending in fiscal year 2019 as the main driver of Indian
economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also been expecting
a private sector investment recovery in the next fiscal year.

Much of this seems to fly in the face of an overwhelming fact: Indian industry
is still struggling with the problem of overcapacity. The production
facilities frenetically built during the previous economic boom have run into
the problem of weak domestic demand. However, the first synchronized recovery
in the global economy since the financial crisis could provide the export
demand needed for Indian companies struggling with excess capacity.

The industrial outlook surveys conducted every quarter by the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) continue to show capacity utilization at a little over 70%. This
number needs to increase by at least 10 percentage points before companies get
back into investment mode. It is also widely known that the twin balance sheet
problem, or the mirror images of excess corporate leverage and a mountain of
soured bank loans, is a huge obstacle for private investment. Companies are
more focused on using cash flows from operations as well as asset sales to
reduce debt rather than invest in new capacity.

However, the global data is more reassuring. Many large economies have seen a
strong revival in corporate investment over the past few months, and it would
be unusual if Indian corporate investment did not pick up, though a lot
depends on what happens to the structural overcapacity in China as a result of
its investment bubble. The big policy gamble taken by the Donald Trump
administration in the US—of a large fiscal stimulus despite tight labour
markets—could blow another global bubble unless monetary policy is tightened
rapidly. But for now it will fuel strong global demand.

Much of the early data in India suggests that the game right now is capacity
expansion rather than building new facilities. The Mark To Market column
published in this newspaper cited the order trends in capital goods companies
such as ABB India, Siemens and Thermax to argue that brownfield investments
are seeing a recovery. There is less action as far as greenfield investments
go. The index of industrial production also suggests that capital goods
production is growing at a healthy clip, though it must be reiterated that
this segment of the factory output data is notoriously volatile.

There is widespread agreement that India cannot have sustainable growth
acceleration unless private sector investment picks up. The economy has till
recently been very heavily dependent on consumer spending plus public
investment by the government. The two other drivers of aggregate
demand—corporate investment and exports—have struggled. It is for this reason
that the recent green shoots are important.

A bit of recent economic history would help clarify why a recovery in private
sector investment matters for India. The two important economic booms in the
26 years since the 1991 economic reforms tell us an important story. Be it the
1994-97 acceleration or the one between 2004-08, it is clear that a
combination of a strong global economy plus a private sector investment boom
is needed to lift the underlying trend economic growth on a sustainable basis.
Consumer spending and government expenditure alone can take economic growth so
far—but no further.

Strong export growth to complement the recovery in domestic demand could help
companies deal with excess capacity. The deleveraging of corporate balance
sheets as well as the recapitalization of public sector banks can create space
for the financing of new industrial capacity. The battle against the
investment slump is far from over—but there is now reason to hope that the
worst is over.

[Ask] Why central and state governments are failing in job creation?,15,57kl2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/57kl2h/ask_why_central_and_state_governments_are_failing/,17,Is it possible for governments to set up new companies to improve job creation? Or do we have to amend old labour laws? What about land acquisition issues? Do we need a new land acquisition law? Is grabbing a land from citizens and giving them some peanuts is acceptable? ,Raghavcm," How about crony socialists not call bharat bands when labour laws are to be amended? Govrnments don't create jobs. That happens only in Marxists countries. 

Otherwise government is enabler not provider. in an open economy as India is vying for government role is not active participation. 

They need to create laws and be ahead of the curve. For example: That fucking fucktard of fuck shit land acquistion bill has been pending since the first time I read the century old law ! Like since 10 yrs chutiyas are still debating and with every revision you are eroding the rights of the original dwellers of the land. Development can not happen at the cost of a community .. .cause when that happens, the capitalist gets the profits and the welfare costs of takign care of the community falls on government, which increases overall expenditure of the state. 

So we need our governments to do these and not work on creating jobs. 

1. Economy - Open economy - Let people from outside come and and minimise protectionist policies that we seem to create to enable competition. Competition will not drive away kirana stores .. Competition will not kill small industries ... 

2. We need to attract high calibre industries for which we need skill based labor. I mean its not like indians cant import the right technology but we for fucking fuck sake cant seem to find the right type of people to do the job. my family is waiting since ever to open an industry in Andhra but damn fuck everybody is in an engineer and yet dont know what the hell does a machine does. Matlab hadd hai. We need skill based strong industrial complex ! 

We need to create a skill based tertiary sector asap for job creation. 

- Labor laws - Big overhaul and again not at the cost of eroding unions ... 

- and can we just kill communism and these systems which have are holding back states from advancing. West bengal has been ruined ... just looking at the state's debt makes me feel like this https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.128773031.6122/flat,800x800,075,f.u6.jpg
 [deleted] Coz giving jobs is not the govt's business.. I know it might sound rude but it is the truth..Days of socialism or crony capitalism is over.. Capitalism in it's true sense needs to be implemented. Government should allow 100% FDI in multi-brand retail. Will bring in a lot of jobs. Because our government is pro-businessmen, not pro-market. No plans. Just PR. Right now we are int he phase of selling and eating our public sector enterprise sales' proceeds.

**India officials trek through villages to map rising joblessness** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: As India’s infamous summer heat started to rise this April, hundreds of researchers began a trek through villages and cities seeking answers to one of the country’s enduring policy puzzles — jobs. The answer could shape Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election bid in 2019.

The South Asian nation’s most ambitious jobs survey to date will reveal annual employment numbers for the whole country and quarterly estimates for its growing cities. That’s a significant change from the current system where the latest numbers are at least one-year old.

More From Livemint »

“This data will bridge a huge gap,” said Pronab Sen, country director at the New Delhi-based International Growth Centre and India’s former chief statistician. “This survey will give us an idea of the size of the GDP of India’s informal sector — there’s no other major economy with such high levels of informality,” he said. More than 90% of workers exist in the grey economy — unaccounted for in any official statistics — which complicates efforts to track unemployment.

India has so far lacked a reliable policy tool in the form of real-time employment numbers to help policy makers and its central bank. Labour is governed by both federal and state governments and data collection is scattered, with seven federal agencies publishing reports, according to the Statistics Ministry.

Poll promises

Before sweeping to power in the biggest election win in 30 years, Modi appealed to young job-seekers — more than half of the population — with a promise to create 10 million jobs. Three years later it remains unclear how many positions have been created. While his critics say Modi’s biggest failure so far has been his inability to increase formal employment, officials in his government say the claims of jobless growth are a “bit bogus.”

Bloomberg

Failure could risk voter backlash over jobs — an issue already driving protests in some parts of the country — and lead to even more divisive campaigning in the lead up to the country’s national elections.

“The nation will come to know whether prime minister Modi has been able to fulfill his electoral promise of creating jobs,” said Satish Misra, an analyst at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. “It will be an answer to India’s unemployment puzzle.”

Jagdish Thakkar, a spokesman in the Prime Minister’s Office, didn’t return calls seeking comment.

Disappearing employment

While India is one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, employment creation in eight sectors, including textiles and automobiles, was the slowest in seven years, according to a 2016 Ministry of Labour report. More than 12 million Indians enter the workforce every year, government data show. Between 2011 to 2015, the number of agricultural jobs reduced by 26 million while non-farm ones rose 33 million, according to McKinsey Global Institute.

Bloomberg

The government has trained more than 700 researchers to feed data directly on to tablets instead of the usual paper questionnaires, according to Rakesh Kumar, additional director general of the National Sample Survey Office.

More than 100,000 sample households across 7,500 villages and 5,000 urban blocks will be questioned every quarter to generate closer-to-real-time information, creating seven quarters worth of credible and comparable quarterly and annual labour data for the first time, Kumar said. The first tranche of data is expected to be revealed in December next year.

Data delinquency

The survey may also be the first set of comparable economic data from India since 2015 when Modi’s government initiated changes to how the nation plots economic indicators like inflation and gross domestic product. Policy makers and economists have puzzled over new GDP and inflation calculations that catapulted India to become the world’s fastest-growing major economy.

The picture was muddled further in November last year after the prime minister overnight cancelled 86% of currency in circulation.

With its landmark goods and services tax launched on 1 July, calculations used to compile GDP and inflation data are also expected to be out of sync for at least a few months.

Yet, in a country where fewer than 5% of people declare their incomes and 1% pay income tax, the GST will help improve GDP calculations by making available high quality, granular data, according to Neelkanth Mishra, managing director and India equity strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG.

Timely release

India’s decision to use Soviet-style five-year plans to plot its economy is another reason for the country’s data delinquency, Mishra said in a phone interview from Mumbai. Modi replaced those plans with a three-year strategy released earlier this year by the government’s planning body NITI Aayog, which discusses “high-productivity, high-wage jobs”.

Yet, there’s some apprehension about whether the government will keep to its timetable to release the labour survey. The task force formed last month under NITI Aayog’s vice chairman Arvind Panagariya recommended an employment survey every three years.

“It seems the data may not go in his government’s favour as there is not much evidence of job creation because of slow down of economy and demonetisation,” said ORF’s Misra about whether Modi will release the jobs survey findings next December. “In that case he will not allow the data to be released few months before the election — if he releases, it will be a bold step.” Bloomberg

Demonetisation and ramping up tensions w/Pakistan is not any less of a giant 2016 event than the others, it affects over a billion people more than either the Philipines drugs crackdown, Turkish coup or ""the Donald""s shenanigans. In the grand scheme of things, maybe India isn't fucking up that much? Or do you think that the international media and it's consensus-making machine is satisfied with the way affairs are headed? ",tejmuk," What has he done to make the entire world to laugh at him? He enforced a very isolating policy. 

On the other hand Duterte called Obama ""son of  a whore"" twice, and Trump, well he's said ""global warming is a Chinese hoax"" to be laughing stock of the world. Because Modi has been doing well in foreign policy. His fuck-ups are primarily domestic. Also, botching demonetisation cannot be compared to the bloodletting in the Philippines. 

Trump also gets enormous amount of attention because the US is the only superpower in the world. Aside from that, he has a habit of overtweeting about foreign policy. He just sent US/China relations into a tizzy because of his stance on Taiwan over a few tweets.

Modi is not more competent than they are, but India still has a lower profile than either. The Philippines isn't as important than India, but the reason why Duterte gets attention is the China connection. Moving away from the US to China gets attention in the Western press, so they try to discredit him. It's a way of warning others.

Also, up until now, Modi had an aura of competence. If he keeps these fuckups going for a few more years, you'll see opinion turning. I'm already seeing NRIs writing self-serving articles how ""Modi is not like Trump at all"". Well, no, but the differences are not amazing either. Modi is, if anything, even more xenophobic than Trump. He constantly invokes foreigners as a weapon to bash others(as recently seen re: Pakistan against demonetisation critics, his dark insinuations about Sonia Gandhi and her foreign roots etc, his rants against Bangladeshi illegal immigrants during the 2014 election and so on. All Trumpian and then some) I still don't understand how he would've gotten that much respect in the first place, considering his dubious past. I would say he's close to Erdogan in that they're both right wing, but Modi is currently _passively_ right wing while Erdogan is _actively_ so, in a lot of ways. Duerte is a raving lunatic, so I don't think we've descended to that level. At least he never really publically admitted to have killed a person in cold blood. Trump, is vastly different from all the other four. He has no politics - he sways with the wind (read money). He is a joke, and I say that even after he got elected. All others are career politicians, who have long backgrounds in politics. But yes, I do think that overseeing such a disastrously executed policy must've gained him some disrepute.  Erdogan is a political laughing stock? What is the definition of laughing stock? Even people who laugh at Trump fear about him.

Who is laughing at Dueterret? From when killing people in name of justice become laughing stock?

 I think he has been at least linked to them because the three have similar campaigning styles (uber-nationalist, savvy use of social media to drown out dissent, hyper-insensitive towards minorities, etc)

[Here's an article which ran in US in run-up to Trump's election pointing out the similarities](http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/opinions/india-election-lessons-richard/).

**India’s imminent economic crisis** 

 ______ 
To foster higher growth, authorities need to focus on productivity enhancing structural reforms that would encourage the private sector to invest in India. Photo: Mint

Poor macroeconomic management, both by the central bank and political regimes over the past several years, is leading India toward an imminent vicious cycle of low growth and high inflation, making it exceedingly vulnerable to emerging domestic and geopolitical risks. The low growth-high inflation scenario will lead to higher fiscal and current account deficits, consequent capital outflows, a weaker currency and a lack of confidence in the economy among investors. The authorities need to undertake meaningful structural reforms and loosen monetary and exchange rate policy at the earliest to arrest the decline before it culminates in an external and financial crisis. A loose fiscal policy (increased government expenditure) at this juncture with a likely low fiscal multiplier would be counterproductive and accelerate the pace of economic decline.

Economic growth in India has likely been lower than the 7% rate that has been estimated by the Central Statistical Authority for the past two-three years. A sustained 7% gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been inconsistent with other major indicators, including credit, investment, index of industrial production, and exports growth slowing for at least the past four years. A slower 5.7% official GDP growth in 2QFY18 is therefore not surprising. In fact, before the switch to a new series of GDP numbers in early 2015, GDP growth estimates were 4.7% for FY14, according to the old series. New methodology introduced in the new series raised them to 6.7% for FY14, inconsistent with other indicators. Amongst other flaws, value added in manufacturing, which has been consistently significantly higher than other indicators would suggest, is arrived at from a corporate financial database maintained by the ministry of corporate affairs. It would be impossible to arrive at a true measure of value added in manufacturing from financial accounting data for even a few large firms such as Reliance, especially in an era where production of goods and services is becoming increasingly integrated.

Economic output and growth depend mainly on productivity growth and on increases in labour and capital; most commentators mistakenly tend to focus instead on the uses of this output—consumption, investment and exports. Productivity growth, the main driver of growth, depends on structural reforms that would require better institutions and improving human skills.

Structural reforms are reforms aimed at changing the structure of the economy to make it more market-oriented, and consequently efficient and productive. India needs to focus on reforms in several areas—liberalizing markets, legal, civil service, tax structure, financial sector, education, and labour, amongst others. In competitive markets, any price different from the market-determined one (e.g. controls such as minimum or maximum prices) leads to a decline in output, ensuring reduced GDP.

To foster higher economic growth and job creation, the authorities need to focus on productivity enhancing structural reforms that would encourage the private sector—domestic and foreign—to invest in India. Specifically, the innumerable controls on markets and administered prices need to be freed up, including food and agricultural prices, water, electricity, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, seeds and railways, amongst others that reduce output and lead to a misallocation of resources. The direct tax structure needs to be simple and transparent with retrospective taxes eliminated. Public sector banks need to be recapitalized and privatized. The education system needs to be opened up to investors—domestic and foreign—as a profit-making sector, both at the school and higher education levels. These are minimal measures to attract investments.

The inexplicably tight monetary policy of high interest rates and overvalued exchange rate have been damaging to the economy. The insistence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to engage in foreign exchange market intervention to maintain an overvalued currency has encouraged further volatile debt inflows. This has increased India’s external vulnerability and inhibited financial markets development.

Overall, RBI’s high interest rate and overvalued exchange rate policy has hurt credit growth, especially to industry, hurt firm-level debt sustainability and in turn bank balance sheets, and damaged exports and domestic industry further via cheaper imports. India is the only major economy in Asia with a negative credit gap (deviation from trend), according to the International Monetary Fund.

Fiscal policy has largely been unimaginative and a tighter fiscal policy with tight monetary policy has meant no policy support for growth over the past several years. Tax policy has mainly been one of raising tax rates—excise duties on petrol and diesel mainly and service tax rates that have increased from 12% to 18% over the last three years. At the same time, little effort has been made to simplify tax rules; indeed, the new goods and services tax structure with multiple rates is the most complicated globally. This structure with a smattering of controls has kept money out of India.

The fiscal multiplier is low; around 0.3 for emerging economies, according to some estimates. This means an increased fiscal expenditure of Rs40,000 crore (0.3% of GDP) being mentioned in the press would yield a negligible additional growth of 0.1% to GDP, raising growth from 5.7% to 5.8%.

The costs of this misguided fiscal expansion (government expenditure) could be significantly high. It would not lead to sustainable growth or increased investments from the private sector. The larger fiscal deficit, along with slowing growth reducing tax revenue, and a consequent worsening fiscal situation would lead to more borrowing from the RBI. At the same time, the deteriorating economic situation would lead to capital outflows, slowing the economy further, draining liquidity from the system and raising interest rates, further dampening economic growth.

To conclude, the government needs to undertake structural reforms on a war-footing to encourage investments to grow the economy and increase revenue growth. Interest rates need to be reduced by the RBI. Misadventures such as expansionary fiscal policy will not be sustainable and will lead to low growth, higher fiscal deficit, high inflation, less competitiveness that would trigger capital outflows and lead to an external and also a financial crisis if financial sector weaknesses are not addressed.

**Indian economy: From policy paralysis to investment paralysis**

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

**Calls to weaken rupee are misguided** 

 ______ 
Rather like Goldilocks, commentators on the Indian rupee don’t like the value of the currency too low or too high—they would like it just right. Thus, when the rupee is weak, there are complaints that it is too weak; with a strong rupee, there are complaints that it is too strong. It is understandable that industry shills should press for a weakening of the rupee. But it is not just those with a vested interest in promoting domestic industry who are crying foul— eminent economists have now joined the fray. In this newspaper, former chief economic adviser Deepak Nayyar and economist Ajit Ranade have batted for a weaker rupee in the past few weeks. Nayyar, in particular, is explicit that this is best achieved through lowering the policy interest rate, which, it is alleged, is too high.

Unfortunately, such arguments suffer from the fallacy of thinking that the tail wags the dog. It is not that the rupee is too strong relative to the US dollar, but rather that the US dollar is weak—relative to a wide range of currencies, not just the rupee.

The figure shows a broad trade-weighted US dollar index from July 2016 to the present, and this clearly reveals that after a period of steady appreciation culminating approximately at the time that Donald Trump was inaugurated US president, the dollar has been steadily depreciating.

The rupee’s initial weakening followed by strengthening is a mirror image of this. Indeed, the dollar shows broadly similar behaviour vis-a-vis a range of advanced and emerging economy currencies. The fundamental driver is perhaps the market’s sense that Trump’s economic programme—tax cuts and infrastructure spending—is floundering. It is noteworthy that even with monetary tightening, the dollar has been weakening.

The real story is thus of dollar weakness, not rupee strength, and this turns the analysis on its head. For there is little if anything that Indian monetary authorities can—or should—do in the face of a fluctuating dollar, beyond attempting to smooth excess volatility. As it happens, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does intervene in currency markets, exactly for this reason, not to alter the underlying market-determined path of the exchange rate.

There is a second key proposition that critics miss. In a world of open capital markets, and in which the central bank wishes to pursue an independent monetary policy—in the case of India and many others, that choice is inflation targeting—we must, perforce, accept that the nominal exchange rate will be largely market-determined. In other words, you cannot simultaneously pursue an independent monetary policy and control the exchange rate—a fundamental insight that we owe to the Nobel economist Robert Mundell and to which many critics seem strangely oblivious.

Unless critics would like India to abandon our inflation-targeting monetary policy regime and substitute it with a fundamentally different system, such as fixing the exchange rate to the US dollar or something else equally radical, they cannot simultaneously grumble about the interest rate and the exchange rate in an open economy.

It is perfectly possible to debate whether the global economy is in need of systemic monetary reform, but that is very different from suggesting that India, acting alone, should abandon inflation targeting in favour of a more exotic policy approach. And, if we accept inflation targeting, or indeed any conventional flexible exchange-rate monetary policy regime, we must accept that the value of the rupee will be basically market-determined, full stop.

The truth is this: Those at present batting for a lower policy rate and/or a weaker rupee are, it would appear, concerned primarily with the interests of domestic Indian industry, not Indian consumers— who stand to benefit from a stronger rupee to the extent that, for instance, they purchase foreign goods or travel abroad— or indeed the economy as a whole.

Let us not forget that an artificially weakened currency can make up, at least for a while, for a multitude of sins, such as low productivity in domestic industry, and that is another reason why industry pushes for it. Why become more competitive and more efficient when, hey presto, your friendly neighbourhood central banker can bid down the value of the currency and let you stand on stilts for a while? This is an old trick. For instance, Canada for years cushioned low domestic productivity with a depreciated currency.

The RBI’s monetary policy committee is correctly focused on achieving the inflation-target mandate, and ought not to get distracted by the red herring that a strong rupee is hurting the economy.

New Delhi: India could face significant short-term economic costs from the ban on large-denomination currency notes, with no significant long-term benefits, economist Paul Krugman warned on Friday.

The 2008 Nobel Prize-winning economist said there is a good case to be made for not having high-value currency notes, but noted that India’s “unusual move” of discontinuing old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was only a one-time effort to flush out hoarded money, and not to eliminate the denominations forever.

“I understand the motivation, but it is a highly disruptive way to do it. I hardly see significant long-run gains, but there certainly are significant, although temporary, costs,” Krugman, a professor at The Graduate Center, City University of New York, said at the Hindustan Times Leadership summit.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 8 November scrapped the high-denomination currency notes in a crackdown on unaccounted wealth, tax evasion, terror finance and counterfeit currency. The move took out 86% of the value of currency in circulation, and economists have warned that it would dent consumer demand in the short term, set back gains to agriculture from a bountiful monsoon and harm productivity.

One of the reasons for Krugman’s disapproval of demonetisation as part of a drive to tackle income tax evasion is his belief that it is practically difficult for developing economies with large unorganized sectors to raise the share of taxes as a proportion of GDP by relying too much on income taxes.

Although considered regressive, indirect taxes, such as the central excise duty and service tax levied by the central government in India and value added tax (VAT) by states, are more practical tools to raise tax revenue, he said. Indirect taxes are generally considered regressive as they affect the rich and the poor alike, unlike income tax, the burden of which increases progressively on tax payers with high income levels.

India is now leading the discussions among G20 nations for a multilateral framework to prevent income tax evasion, especially corporate tax, based on principles laid down by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group of developed economies.

“Trying to have an OECD style income tax system in a country which has a per capita GDP far below OECD levels is not doable,” Krugman said.

The American economist said India could be hit by a recession in China stemming from declining investment, but has no reason to worry about the US turning more protectionist under Donald Trump.

Krugman said it would be difficult for China to sustain investments as a share of GDP and a readjustment can spell trouble for other economies including India.

“China cannot continue its previous investment-driven growth model. How can you manage the large scale of adjustment without a massive recession?. China looks to me ready to blow up,” said Krugman.

He doesn’t see much of an impact on India from the US possibly taking steps to protect its jobs, including from the services sector in India.

“I do not see a short-run macroeconomic crisis (in the US). If anything, policy will shift to fiscal expansion. Extremely unwise long-run policy does not necessarily carry a short-run cost. Economics is not a morality play. You can have bad policies turning out to be catastrophic a generation from now, but that does not necessarily bring a recession now. The US is not going to be a drag on the world economy, but If China blows up, it is going to be a drag on the world economy,” said Krugman.

He added that not being a trade surplus country will work to India’s advantage in this context. The comment comes in the backdrop of US president elect Donald J Trump’s economic policies widely being taken to be protectionist and hence likely to rattle a still recovering global economy.

Krugman said unlike China or Brazil, India will not be at the receiving end of any protectionist measure by the US.

Krugman attributes the current weak global economic growth to a chronic weakness in demand, which was not the outcome of the asset bubble and financial crisis of 2008, but something which ran deeper.

“There is a an underlying inadequacy in spending, which was masked by the asset bubble. The preponderance of evidence now is that this is the new normal that we need to live in a world which does not want to spend enough to keep itself fully employed,” Krugman said. “Unlike earlier thought, high level of public debt due to the economic stimulus that nations doled out in the last few years, now looks misplaced as interest rates are low.”

Krugman also called for a big burst of fiscal expansion in the world economy after which one could think of resetting policies.

**A credibility deficit in statistics** 

 ______ 
The Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) on 29 May. This is the first estimate for a full year after the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) took over. The growth rate of GDP at 7.3% at constant prices is not only better than the last year of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) but also makes India the fastest growing economy in the world. At a time when the world economy is showing signs of slowing, the performance of the Indian economy judged by these numbers should be cause for cheer. The fact that India’s economy grew faster than China’s may give the impression that all is well, despite fears of rural distress across India.

Unfortunately, nobody seems to be happy with these numbers. Not only has the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the red flag doubting these numbers in its policy review, even the finance ministry has advised caution while interpreting these numbers. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided to send a team to understand the new GDP numbers put up by the CSO. Even the financial media, which should have lapped up these numbers, has shown maturity while reporting them.

India’s statistical agency is well-regarded not only in India but also internationally, but the new GDP numbers pose a serious challenge to its credibility. While the CSO did bring out an explanatory fact sheet, thus far, its attempts to explain these numbers have not worked—partly because the explanations have been largely in terms of accounting and the arithmetic of national accounting, with very little clarity on the nature of changes and the sources of divergence between the new series and the old series.

It is not the arithmetic that is being questioned; the very basis of growth that seems to be at variance with the optimistic picture being presented by the national accounts. The high growth rate of GDP is attributed largely to the better-than-average performance of services and manufacturing with agriculture, mining and construction showing deceleration. The growth rate of manufacturing at 7.1% is not only at variance with the growth rate of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) at 2.3% but is also at variance with the reported sales of automobiles, tractors and many other manufactured goods, all of which show deceleration in sales and production. For the record, sales of commercial vehicles last year declined by 2.8%.

Even for the services sector, the growth rates appear far too optimistic. Profits of companies do not reflect this optimism; nor do sales figures, which are subdued compared with the numbers reported in the national accounts estimates. Other data, such as exports and investment data, are also at variance with the rosy picture presented by the CSO. Clearly, there is something missing as far as the GDP numbers are concerned. Quite simply, the whole is not the sum of parts as expected in an accounting sense.

One of the reasons offered by the CSO for the variance has been the change in methodology of arriving at these numbers. To keep up with international practices, the CSO changed the methodology of computing GDP and its aggregates. As a result, the manufacturing growth rate, which was earlier based on the IIP and the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) data on volume and value-added growth, now also takes into account the advance tax filing data maintained by the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA). This practice of using tax data extends to the services sector as well, unlike the earlier series which used volume-based indices.

While the new series may be consistent with the best practices adopted internationally, doubts remain. These are not only related to the conceptual framework for measuring growth in sectors and sub-sectors of the economy but also to the coverage of the MCA database. This is particularly a problem of developing countries, where the informal/unorganized sector still constitutes a large part of the economy. Serious questions have also been raised by Prof. R. Nagaraj—a member of the committee which recommended the use of MCA data—not only on the completeness of the data but also the methodology adopted to blow up the estimates.

It is obvious that the new series raises far too many questions than it has answered so far. A reasonable approach to such drastic changes would have included a wider discussion among the academic community as well as media dissemination before the new series was adopted. By maintaining secrecy on these, the CSO has not only messed up its communication strategy but also done considerable damage to its credibility.

The matter is not only about statistical methods and estimates. The issue of national accounts is also fundamental to the understanding of what is happening to different sectors of the economy and the way different sectors respond to various policy measures. A discredited database not only does injustice to the statistical system of the country but also hinders policy response needed for long term growth by giving mixed signals.

The main criticisms were that Index of Industrial Production (IIP) growth data was at odds with manufacturing growth in the 2011-12 series. The new IIP 2011-12 series released seems to reconcile these numbers and hence an upward revision. 

Second, there has been no back series of GDP or GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) released based on 2011-12 prices. So essentially, we have estimates 2011-12 onwards and we have earlier estimates based on 2004-05 prices. We cannot directly compare these numbers as it's simply not a base shift, it is a shift in methodology. ",Policy/Economy,2017-06-04 05:27:32

**Overseas investors bullish on India dollar debt even as economy slows; here’s why** 

 ______ 
For all the weak spots in India’s economy, investor love for the nation’s offshore bonds endures.Companies have sold $10.6 billion of dollar debt so far in 2017, the most in three years, as one of the highest returns in Asia and prospects of a sovereign-rating upgrade prompt buyers to ignore data showing gross domestic product in the June quarter expanded at the slowest pace since 2014.“There’s not only large institutional demand but also high retail appetite,” A.S. Thiyaga Rajan, a senior managing director at Aquarius Investment Advisors in Singapore, said by phone. “Some top Indian names are coming up” with dollar debt offerings, he said.The optimism around Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic policies and prospects of outsized profits are proving hard to resist for bond bulls. Dollar-denominated debt from India has returned 5.68 percent this year, compared with 4.95 percent in China and 2.98 percent in South Korea, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes.There’s more juice left in the rally, according to Anthony Leung, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo & Co.‘Good Value’India’s investment-grade company bonds “remains a pocket of good value” across Asia and the steps taken by Modi’s government are “steering the economy in the right direction,” he wrote in a Sept. 7 note. While challenges remain in cleaning up bad loans at banks, the start of an unified sales tax, abolition of subsidies and low oil prices will help offset the problems, he said.The policy measures are bearing fruit and will lead to the nation’s credit rating being raised by Moody’s Investors Service “within a year,” Leung said. A Moody’s spokesperson said the firm does not comment on third-party speculation on ratings.Rating firms have India just above “junk” status and while Modi’s government has pushed for an upgrade in the past few years, Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have all pushed back, citing high debt levels.Green BondsThat said, the unexpected slowdown in growth hasn’t put investors off India’s corporate debt or slowed new issuance. Buyers have drawn confidence from the fact that the nation is still one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and a strong political mandate gives Modi more policy flexibility to revive expansion.Power Finance Corp., a state-run lender to utilities, has sought bids from credit rating firms for its $1 billion medium-term notes. Bharat Petroleum Corp. plans to raise $500 million via Singapore-listed bonds, Director of Finance K. Sivakumar said Tuesday. State Bank of India plans to raise up to $3 billion in the nation’s biggest overseas green-bond issue, the Economic Times reported last week, citing an unnamed executive close to the initiative.“There’s more demand than supply for Indian bonds as investors bet on the outlook of the Modi-led economy,” said Bryan Wang, a fund manager at Fuh-Hwa Investment Trust Co. in Taipei.

Politics! Politics! 

RBI should keep the financial overstatements in check, and keep the government walking on a tight rope if it's to fulfil its goals.  Weather forecast has been more reliable lately.  Can we come to a conclusion already? Watch.

In 6 years, once things improve - people will bitch about this period and blame RR for holding hs back.

You never get credit for making things go - not wrong. I really respect this guy and modi for not fucking with him even though they have had their disagreements. The economy is in shambles and I'm happy that he's not sugarcoating this. Just a day in office for him, I believe. The best suited guy for the job too. 

I'm happy as long as there is a plan, god damn it.  We have moved a little from having a balanced inflation to having some upside risk inflation forecast for next year, says Rajan.

**Indian economy: From policy paralysis to investment paralysis**

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

The analytical solution would help the income tax department gather data received from banks, post offices and other sources for linking of information and identification of duplicate details.

New Delhi: To plug tax loopholes, the income tax (I-T) department will use Big Data analytics to track down evaders by collecting information such as common address, mobile number and e-mail to establish relationship between their multiple PANs. The department, with support from private firms, will analyse the voluminous data available post demonetisation for checking relationships between PAN holders.

The managed service provider (MSP), which the I-T department plans to hire, will design and operationalise analytical solution that will help collating data, matching it and identifying relationships as well as clustering of PAN and non-PAN data, an official said.

The analytical solution would help the department gather data received from banks, post offices and other sources for linking of information and identification of duplicate details. It will also identify records with errors or other defects for resubmission.

“The data quality errors and defects will be communicated to the reporting person or entities, say, banks or post offices for correction and improving data quality,” the official added.

The data integration and matching of the PAN based demonetisation information with that of I-T databases such as tax returns, TDS, third-party reporting, tax payments, would be used to build a comprehensive profile for the taxpayer. It will help identify link between PAN holders on the basis of relationships (business association, asset and transactional association) available in various databases, the official said, adding that the analytics will do clustering of PAN-linked demonetised data using identified relationships as well as common address, mobile number, e-mail and bank branch.

Also, it will cluster non-PAN demonetised data using common name, address, mobile number, e-mail and bank branch. Taxpayer segmentation on the basis of taxpayers’ status, type of ITR form used, nature of business, taxpayer segment, age of the individual and compliance history will also have to be prepared. It will prioritise demonetisation data based on taxpayer segment, relationships, clusters, rules and risk matrix.

“Different types of interventions (send e-mail, SMS, outbound call, letter, notice, verification, investigation) can be selected for taxpayer priority and segment,” the official added.

**Opinion: Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government's decision to not send an envoy to China's big
Belt and Road Forum (abbreviated, incredibly, BARF) has been the cause of much
wailing and gnashing of teeth in New Delhi. Given the fact that India is
practically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that
dozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of
their governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government
deliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as
stubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.

Well, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign
policy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on
grounds that are both principled and realist.

The government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-
articulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that
""connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility
to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;
balanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;
transparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to
help long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local
communities."" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the
path of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-
initiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were
clearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the
sustainability issues involved.

While India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it
is not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The
Guardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the
resolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental
reasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of
""isolation"" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign
up to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India
is the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the
subject, and of that we can be proud.

Let's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take
advantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free
country and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian
manufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by
China, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.
It is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what
OBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own
position in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will
not, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in
particular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on
infrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS
Bank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.
This is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently
violate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would
fail to uphold.

This is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has
taken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In
almost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of
Manmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in
such matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the
Singh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's
sensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:
Beijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's ""core
interests"". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to
the Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-
II, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact
with Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would
also have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit
from the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's
sensitivities.

By taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi
has done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand
on a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.

There are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is
essentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and
economics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a
leader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an
alternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-
driven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's
America turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free
movement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles
everywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.

And second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this
regard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which
serve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries
and economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,
Singapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.

Modi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning
to deliver. He must keep going.

**Central bank liquidity withdrawal: Short-term uncertainty can be long-term opportunity** 

 ______ 
Recently, we have seen huge sell-off in the global bond market as nervousness deepened that central banks are moving toward reducing stimulus efforts that have supported debt markets Almost all the central banks be it the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, the Bank of England or the Bank of Canada, each one is preparing the markets for a gradual withdrawal from accommodative monetary policies.The global economy is experiencing synchronous growth, labor markets are improving and consumer spending and business investment have picked up. However inflation is running below central banks’ targets. The recent data on inflation shows that there is a pickup in inflation but it still remains below desired levels in most developed economies.The minutes of the US Federal Open Market Committee’s June policy discussions shower a split over inflation. Minutes from the ECB released indicated that the ECB was worried about how best to communicate increasing confidence in the eurozone economy without roiling market. The news of shifting monetary policy trajectories of central banks have led to the volatility in both stock market and Forex market.The Bank of Japan and the European Central banks are scheduled to meet on July 20 and Fed interest rates decision is scheduled on July 26. Though Fed Chair Yellen has said that the US economy is healthy enough for the Fed to proceed with plans to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, but it is expected that Fed would slow the pace of rate hikes down the road and interest rates would remain historically low over the longer term.Emerging economies including India have undoubtedly been benefited from the environment of lower interest rates.Among all major economies, the interest rate regime in India only is on a downward trajectory.Meanwhile, recent data pointed to slowing industrial production growth and to a falling retail price inflation has given room to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to resort to accommodative stance from neutral at the review meeting on August 2.The markets know that the long period of low rates has to end sometime and a gradual normalisation of policy rates may not necessarily impact the stock markets. However, a sudden change in yield expectations may cause volatility in the market. As the fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong, any inorderly tapering by the major central bankers would have limited impact on the Indian stock market.So, it is advised to use any dip into the market as buying opportunity and remain invested for long term as India is a bright spot among its peer though its valuation looks rich.

[Politics] Is the golden age over for emerging markets?,20,64q0jq,http://www.livemint.com/Money/pcyXUJDZsh0G08fOB3XF7L/Is-the-golden-age-over-for-emerging-markets.html,2,,whiplash_14," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. 

 ______ 
**Is the golden age over for emerging markets?** 

 ______ 
The answer to that question is probably yes, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A chapter in its latest World Economic Outlook warns emerging economies they can no longer count on the benign external environment that had led to high economic growth in their economies in the last few decades.

It warns of “fading external tailwinds, including waning potential growth in advanced economies, slowdown and rebalancing in China, and a shift in the commodity cycle that has affected commodity exporters”. It says that, “Together with a risk of protectionism in advanced economies and tighter financial conditions as US monetary policy normalizes, these changes make for a more challenging external environment for emerging market and developing economies going forward.”

The chart paints a broad picture. It shows how the contribution of emerging markets to world growth increased from 18.2% during 1976-79 to 69.82% during 2010-15. The contribution of developing countries to world consumption rose even more markedly—from 13.9% during 1976-79 to 72% in 2010-15. But the rise of emerging markets is an old story. What’s new are the projections—the IMF forecasts that the contribution of emerging economies to both global growth and consumption will decrease during the period 2016-2021, as the chart indicates. True, the decrease is not much, but it does mark a turning point from the hefty increases of earlier decades.

How important are external conditions for growth in emerging markets? The IMF article says a 1 percentage point increase in domestic absorption by a country’s trading partners translates into around a fifth of the annual average growth in GDP per capita in emerging markets. And secondly, a 1 percentage point increase in the ratio of capital flows to GDP of emerging market and developing economies raises medium-term growth by 0.2 percentage points.

Taken together with higher growth on account of better terms of trade for commodities, the IMF estimates that over the past two decades, these factors accounted for more than half of medium-term growth, on average, across emerging market and developing economies. In turn, about half of the contribution to growth from external factors is due to higher capital inflows to emerging markets.

Will India too be affected? Well, India is one of those countries where domestic demand has been the mainstay of growth. But we shouldn’t underestimate the important part that external demand has played in supplementing that growth. One very important element of India’s liberalisation story and of its growth pick-up after liberalisation is the increase in its share of exports of goods and services to GDP from 6.8% in 1990-91 to 25% in 2013-14. The most rapid spurt happened in the early noughties, during the period of the global boom, when the ratio went up from 12.6% in 2001-02 to 23.7% in 2008-09.

As the IMF report says, “a favourable impulse from external demand and financial conditions helps medium-term growth outcomes by making growth accelerations more likely. It also reduces the likelihood of growth reversals.”

That’s not all. The rise in fund flows to the Indian stock markets during the noughties led to a boom in the secondary and primary equity markets, allowing companies to raise capital easily and lowering their cost of capital. This, in turn, sparked an investment boom and also led to higher employment, higher wages and consequently, to higher consumption. As the IMF says, “Capital inflows can enhance growth in emerging market and developing economies through various channels: augmentation of funds available for investment, transmission of crucial know-how and technological diffusion, and adoption of market discipline and better governance practices.”

Given the importance of the external sector, what then can be done to mitigate the impact of the headwinds mentioned above? The IMF believes that, faced with a potentially less supportive external environment than in the past, emerging market and developing economies can get the most out of a weaker growth impulse from external conditions by strengthening their institutional frameworks and adopting a policy mix that protects trade integration; permits exchange rate flexibility; and ensures that vulnerabilities stemming from high current account deficits and external debt, as well as high public debt, are contained.

These are all standard text-book remedies, but complying with them will be all the more important in a less benign external environment.

The markets, fixated perhaps on the short term, seem to be ignoring these long-run risks outlined by the IMF. As a recent Bank for International Settlements paper by Luis Awazu Pereira de Silva and Elod Takats says, “We are witnessing a departure from the policies of trade integration and multilateral cooperation that have been our successful recipe for the last 50 years. Is it purely rhetorical or real? Temporary or lasting? Is it linked to the current backlash against globalisation? Therefore, there is a disconnect between market exuberance and policy uncertainty. There are indeed threats to trade, financial integration and international cooperation that benefited both AEs and EMEs. These threats are increasing.”

The Real Reason Why India's Economy Is Smaller Than China's,32,43i4g9,http://thediplomat.com/2015/09/heres-the-real-reason-why-indias-economy-is-smaller-than-chinas/,14,,john_doe1232," I would think South East Asia and South Korea example should make it pretty clear that our current situation is absolutely due to policies pursued post independence. 

There was a clear jump in our trend GDP growth rate after liberalization in 1992. 

 Why did India's economy falter?

---

> * For the past few decades, Indias economy has not grown as fast as it could, or as fast as Chinas.

> * However, Indias share of the global economy fell sharply during the 19th and 20th centuries, knocking it out of the top ten for a while (in raw GDP terms, the economy did grow but very slowly relative to industrialized countries).

> * However, modern economists and historians emphasize the fact that the British policy toward Indias economy was more nuanced and was more concerned with the British homelands trade policy than actually literally draining away wealth from India.

> * All in all, it can be concluded that Indias economy and place in global economic rankings is smaller than it should be at least partially because of British action, though the extent and intent of this action is a matter of debate.

We liberalized our economy 13 years after China did the same. This is the only reason.  A good article and the comments for the article is even more interesting. I think one of the big reasons is that the Chinese government has an almost totalitarian grip over the country.

What this means is, for example if they are making a bridge and they need permission from some people to raze their houses to make way, the government decides how much they will be compensated, when they have to vacate and if the homeowner goes against that, he is thrown in jail.

Thus a lot of daily hurdles that the Indian government has, the Chinese don't.

Looking so far back as the British is of no use. In 1960 India was doing better than China on all parameters. Technological dominance came later. Nauroji's argument holds because the British actually took wealth out of India, and used it to finance other ventures, including development of technology.

The RBI has managed to keep interest rates high enough for a while now (without succumbing to pressures from the business side; thanks dr Rajan!). Lowered inflation is a natural outcome of current Indian monetary policy. I fail to see the fiscal policies that could have contributed to this. The latest budget does not contain any dramatic shifts in terms of spending or taxation, so I'd be surprised to attribute this outcome to the new government.

The government of India is in overdrive to promote digital payments in a country that is excessively dependent on cash with one of the highest cash to gross domestic product ratios in the world. Niti Aayog has proposed an award scheme to incentivize people to use digital modes of payments. Last week, the government announced several measures—such as discounts at petrol pumps and on rail tickets, and insurance policies sold by public sector insurance companies—to boost digital transactions.

There is indeed merit in reducing the usage of cash in the economy as electronic transactions, among other things, leave a trail and make tax avoidance more difficult. However, moving towards a more cashless society is a medium-to-long term goal. The government’s present urgency to turn the ongoing currency swap into a major push to make India a cashless economy must be seen keeping this in mind.

ALSO READ | Watal panel moots independent payments regulator

To be sure, the narrative of the currency exchange programme has changed significantly in the last one month. It was conceived and launched as an attack on black money and counterfeiting of currency notes, but the objective now seems to have shifted to making India a cashless economy. This newspaper supported the idea of the currency swap as part of a bouquet of policies against tax evaders. It was clear from the word go that this would only attack a part of the stock of black money that is stored in cash. But the incoming evidence suggests that many tax evaders have actually managed to launder their illicit wealth. A large number of new bank notes being recovered by the authorities in various parts of the country and a massive surge in deposits in Jan-Dhan accounts are cases in point. Clearly, the implementation of the currency exchange has left much to be desired. Effectiveness of policy also depends on implementation; ideas alone don’t lead to desired outcomes.

It now appears that the amount of currency notes that will not return to the banking system was overestimated. This perhaps explains the pivot to the cashless theme. As Praveen Chakravarty of IDFC Institute highlighted in these pages on Monday, Prime Minister Narender Modi mentioned “black money” 18 times in his initial speech on 8 November and did not talk about cashless or digital economy. However, in two speeches that he gave on 27 November, he mentioned “cashless” and/or “digital” 24 times, but black money came in only nine times. The excessive amount of time being taken to replace the currency notes and persistent queues in front of banks and ATMs may also have prompted the government to push for digital transactions.

ALSO READ | Regulating the digital payment industry

However, the government would be well-advised to not depict the transition to a more cashless economy as the main objective behind the currency reform. The overwhelming public support that the government got after the withdrawal of high-value notes was for the attack on black money and not for making transactions cashless.

Reducing the role of cash in the system is a worthy goal, but it cannot be the driving force for this policy as it now appears to have become. As noted in this editorial, the move towards a more cashless system is a longer-term goal. There are practical problems on the way. A vast majority of Indians either don’t have bank accounts or the technological wherewithal to make or receive digital payments. Many of them belong to the same aspirational middle and neo-middle class that supported the move as an attack on black money and corruption.

Furthermore, digitization alone will not justify the political and economic risk attached to the currency swap. The latest high-frequency economic indicators such as auto sales and Purchasing Managers’ Index for both services and manufacturing shows that economic activity has been affected, though the actual overall impact will only be known in the coming months. In terms of the political impact, the renewed friction between the government and the opposition has resulted in almost the entire winter session of Parliament being wasted, and it now appears that meeting the 1 April deadline for the implementation of the goods and services tax will be extremely difficult.

Since the government has taken a big political risk, it should avoid moving the goalposts. Changing the narrative of the currency swap could affect the government’s credibility and make it more difficult to take tough decisions. It will be a long-drawn-out battle against black money and action will be required on various fronts. Not all of it will be successful.

**Modi government: The next two years** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government completed three years in office last week. Any assessment of its economic performance should take into account what it inherited. India faced a near-crisis situation in 2013. Inflation had spun out of control. Public finances were a mess. The rupee was in free fall. Confidence was low owing to corruption scandals and economic mismanagement by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in the years leading to the 2014 general election.

India has come a long way since then. The most important economic policy achievement of the past three years has been macroeconomic stability. Inflation is now under control. There has been a tentative recovery in economic growth. The balance of payments is comfortable. Part of this can be explained by the steep decline in global energy prices, but the retreat from loose monetary and fiscal policies has also been an important reason why the Indian economy is no longer fragile.

The reforms record has been a more mixed one—especially since Modi spoke on the campaign trail about minimum government and maximum governance.

The Modi government should be satisfied that the stage is now set for the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST). Even the flawed GST we are beginning with will boost overall efficiency in the economy. India now has a new monetary policy framework. The passage of the bankruptcy code will lead to more efficient allocation of capital. However, these policy initiatives were inherited from the UPA regime. The Modi government needs to now craft its own reforms playbook for the next decade.

There have been some important initiatives. A new fiscal framework is in the works. High-level corruption has almost disappeared. The auction of natural resources has been done in a transparent manner. The government has also taken a number of steps to check the flow of black money. However, the most radical move made by the Modi government was the withdrawal of high-value banknotes in November 2016. The benefits of the move are not yet clear, and will only be known in the years ahead.

The government has managed to bring down the fiscal deficit while increasing capital expenditure. A recent report by Deutsche Bank showed that government expenditure led by capital expenditure increased in the last two years of the term of every government since 1991, with the exception of UPA-II, when expenditure went up in the last year. However, barring UPA-I, higher expenditure did not result in a corresponding increase in the fiscal deficit. It will be important for the Modi government to stick to the stated fiscal path, and not indulge in a spending spree like the UPA, as it could compromise the hard-won macroeconomic stability.

Along with maintaining fiscal discipline, the government will have to continue to work in areas that are holding back the economy. One of the reasons why growth has remained subdued in the last few years is the collapse in private sector investment. Policymakers have not been able to solve the twin balance sheet problem. A coherent strategy to clean up banks is still not in evidence. Privatization of public sector banks should be seriously considered.

Also, all efforts should be made to strengthen the corporate bond market in order to channelize long-term finance for Indian companies. This will also help boost activity in the infrastructure sector where private sector investment has been missing, partly because of the reluctance of banks to lend. An investment revival is critical for higher growth.

The government should now work on the next level of reforms. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government managed to do a lot of things in the latter half of its tenure. For instance, the fiscal responsibility and budget management rules and pension reforms were implemented towards the end of its tenure. The looming political risk is that the job creation needed to maintain social stability cannot be addressed without reforms in factor markets. The complex web of laws does not allow enterprises to grow. The next level of reforms should simplify laws in the land and labour markets, which will significantly improve the ease of doing business in the country.

Finally, Modi should know by now that India is being held back by inadequate state capacity. The government does too much in some areas; and it does too little in others. It needs to build capabilities to manage the fastest growing large economy in the world—but not fall into the interventionist trap that it so often seems to be doing these days.

Recent history has clearly demonstrated that economic growth is the best solution for poverty alleviation and improving standards of living. Therefore, the challenge for the Modi government would be to take the Indian economy to a sustainable high growth path. And the next two years will be as important, if not more so, than the past three years.

All this time governments were afraid of ruffling Chinese feathers. why do these media cartoons write these idiotic headlines? There is life after China. This is more an attempt to forge better relations with India's neighbours and nearby countries.  If so, it's pointless. One Mongolia is nothing compared to what China is doing in Indian ocean. Chinese interests appear to be more pro-China than anti-India focused as such. They want new markets, new opportunities and resources, and they are actively developing it where ever they can. I think India should focus on competing them at that level, rather than doing something because it's anti-China, IMHO. Slightly off topic but in Mongolia, they drink horse's milk.

New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley is likely to significantly increase public investment in infrastructure in Union Budget 2017, offering fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth at a time when private investment shows no signs of a pick-up.

There is near unanimity that the economy needs to be spurred through higher public investment, unlike last year when there was a significant divergence of opinion over the need for fiscal stimulus, said an official with knowledge of the thinking within the government. The official requested anonymity.

Last year, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry Arvind Subramanian advocated a stimulus, but the minister decided to stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), fearing a backlash from investors and rating agencies.

“Different schools of thought have argued either in favour of fiscal consolidation and stability or for a less aggressive consolidation and for boosting growth. I have weighed the policy options and decided that prudence lies in adhering to the fiscal targets,” Jaitley said in his budget speech last year.

This year, the economic context in which the budget will be presented on 1 February is different.

Investment demand in the economy is expected to contract in 2016-17 by 0.2% from 3.9% growth in 2015-16, according to data released by the government’s statistics department earlier this month.

The investment scenario further worsened after 8 November when the government invalidated high-value currency notes. Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt Ltd (CMIE) data released earlier this month showed a sharp fall in new investment proposals in the October-December quarter to Rs1.25 trillion, compared with an average of Rs2.36 trillion worth of new investments seen per quarter in the preceding nine quarters that the Narendra Modi government has been in power.

Clearly, investors have been spooked.

D.K. Srivastava, chief policy adviser at EY India, said the economy needs a “substantial fiscal stimulus” to revive growth, which had started slowing even before demonetization. “Government can revise upward its fiscal deficit target for next fiscal to 3.5% of GDP from 3% of GDP under the existing fiscal consolidation roadmap. Beyond that it can allow states to borrow more for capital investments.”

ALSO READ | Should the budget stray from straight and narrow path of fiscal consolidation?

The government may be helped by the recommendations of a committee set up under former secretary in the finance ministry and Bharatiya Janata Party member N.K. Singh to suggest a new roadmap for fiscal consolidation. The committee, which was appointed in May last year, was asked by the finance ministry to examine the need and feasibility of aligning fiscal expansion or contraction with credit contraction or expansion, respectively, in the economy. It has also been asked to examine the feasibility a “fiscal deficit range” . The committee is expected to submit its report on Thursday.

The government official cited earlier said one of the key reasons behind advancing the budget presentation by a month is to give more time to key infrastructure departments such as railways, highways and urban development to implement larger projects as more funds will be made available to them.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month told economists at the NITI Aayog that advancing the date of presentation of the Union budget will help speed up investment expenditure in the productive pre-monsoon months.

> * New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley is likely to significantly increase public investment in infrastructure in Union Budget 2017, offering fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth at a time when private investment shows no signs of a pick-up.

> * There is near unanimity that the economy needs to be spurred through higher public investment, unlike last year when there was a significant divergence of opinion over the need for fiscal stimulus, said an official with knowledge of the thinking within the government.

> * Last year, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry Arvind Subramanian advocated a stimulus, but the minister decided to stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), fearing a backlash from investors and rating agencies.

> * This year, the economic context in which the budget will be presented on 1 February is different.

NDA vs. UPA - Same Data Different Stories,44,1v78mm,http://i.imgur.com/msFKJKfh.jpg,34,,st_hill," I am not economist.Current GDP growth estimate by IMF is 4.7% some say actual was 3.5% while CPI inflation is 11.5 %. Indian economy is in total mess if they fail to fix it, it may have similar effect like Argentina. Fast growing China has inflation of 3%  UPA-1 did achieve some good economic figures.
It consequently won.. 

What we should truly evaluate is UPA-2?

I guess the figures would be very different. 



 This is a stupid way of presenting data. Why don't you just show the trend line? These tables are highly prone to misinterpretations. For example, UPA is a 10-year time period vs BJP, a 5 year time period. Best year GDP growth of 9.6 in UPA might be in 2004/2005/2006...which has absolutely no relevance to the disaster that UPA-II is today. It is very much possible that UPA-I reaped the benefits of BJP's policies. 

TL;DR: Just show us the trendline instead of cherry picking data. UPA I reaped the good sowing of NDA..UPA II is reaping the bad sowing of UPA I. In the NDA years, GDP growth was increasing, while in the UPA years, GDP growth turned negative. When NDA started their term, GDP was near 4-5% growth rate, when they ended, GDP growth was at 8.1%. When UPA started their term, GDP growth was at 8.x%, it peaked at 9% and is now down back to 4-5%. UPA-1 inherited a healthy economy from NDA. It was a ride while it lasted. 

UPA-2 suffered because of UPA-1.   So, effectively, UPA managed to magically turn every single rising graph into a falling graph. Spectacular. 

http://planningcommission.nic.in/data/datatable/1612/table_2.pdf 

In 1997-98 (Non NDA Gov), the GDP was 4.2%

NDA boosted it 8.3% by 2003-04. This momentum was maintained in UPA 1 tenure [but later it you see the graph is moving downward.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-growth-annual) 

In 1998, Infaltion was at 8.26%, by 2004 NDA brought it down to 2.80%. But UPA 1 boosted inflation to 8.70% by 2009 itself!

UPA has been in office for 123 months now and the number of months for which the food inflation stayed above 10% is 78. Thats almost 63% of their total tenure.

Comparing to NDA, they lasted for 72 months, in which the food inflation stayed above 10% only for about 12 months i.e 17% of their tenure. 

Now, i don't know about food prices and other commodity prices, but they surely gone up by 90-900% since the UPA regime took over.

Talking about Fiscal deficit, it was -6.29 in 1998-99, NDA reduced it to -3.88 by 2004. However post 2004, fiscal deficit kept on increasing and now its stands at - 5.15.


 [NDA had current account surplus in 2002, 2003, 2004 \(Again as per above links\). The current account deficit was -2 in 1998. NDA did a nice job and brought it to +2.3 in 2004 which UPA reduced to -5.15 at present. 
](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/current-account)

Regarding jobs, NDA created ~61 million jobs, however UPA 1 could only managed to create 2.7million.

 
Also the savings rate was increased from 23.19% in 1998-99 to 32.41 by 2004. Now its 30.81. 

Regarding exchange rate, the depreciation was of 9% during NDA tenure. Its more than 35% during UPA tenure. 

And lastly, the above data of  showing average scores is basically to fool the voters. We were not hit hard by any recession (and this is not i am saying. It was said by Dr. Singh himself). 

Sources: Mostly from tradingeconomics.com, RBI, Nassco, planning commission, Livemint claim check.  
 Inflation, price rise and massive unemployment neutralized most of the UPA's GDP growth rate and prevented it from actually reaching the people. Try this for perspective.

http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fI98V9JE8uOmAhVS0fjhQO/Claim-Check-Narendra-Modi-on-jobs-created-by-NDA-vs-UPA.html

>The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government created 60 million jobs during its tenure in 1999-2005 as against 2.7 million created during 2004-2009 under the current United Progressive Alliance government. This is called being unambiguous with facts but being open with interpretation. Pretty much my employer's policy. wait... so why is UPA so bad? can i add the [R] tag here.. UPA-I was quite successful,it may not be popular opinion here but India did weather financial crisis better than others.

However UPA-II performed substantially worse because of high interest rates to curb inflation which tanked the growth. http://i.imgur.com/IgMyx.gif",Policy/Economy,2014-01-15 00:53:34
Why should India not side with USA now?,0,57n8qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/57n8qs/why_should_india_not_side_with_usa_now/,10,"It looks like India is so keen in developing ties with USA...  But the next four years (at least) are going to be the toughest in american history. Who ever gets elected  they are doomed. It is better we side with Russians or just stay Not aligned as always? 
What do you think?",iWantMy15Lacs," There is no such thing as alignment in foreign policy especially for countries like India. It's not a zero sum game.

You pursue your own interests. Period. We will work with USA for access to high end tech & invts into Indian econ & work with Russia for energy security & high end defense tech. India should stay firm on non-alignment policy. It had done more good than harm to India in the past, kept us out of unnecessary wars, helped in making new friends easily. I don't think any govt is going to fuck with that. Diplomatic relations are built upon years of work by diplomats staying in those countries. So why try to fix something that is not even broken and would take a lot of time.

Russia is also not in any better condition. USA at least have businesses that provide work to Indian companies. Russia's economy is shrinking and they have put in a lot in Syria. A lot of how long they would continue that they are a superpower would depend on how long they can stretch this crisis.

What the hell kinda car does the reporter drive? Kant pointed to a number of policy decisions that have already been taken in this regard. These include 

* further freeing up the foreign direct investment ( FDI) regime, 

* bringing consistency and predictability to tax policy and 

* pushing hard on infrastructure projects, particularly in roads and railways. 
 Indications of a mining sector reboot suggest that the govt's attempts to revive the economy through reforms and higher public capital.

> * NEW DELHI: India's economy may be about to turn the corner on the back of robust public spending that's beginning to have an impact on the ground coupled with strong urban consumer demand, economists and government officials said.Three months of sound industrial growth driven by manufacturing, signs of a pickup in investment, robust indirect tax collections and indications of a mining sector reboot suggest that the government's attempts to revive the economy through reforms and higher public capital spend are working.Going ahead, the tailwinds of falling interest rates, big foreign inflows and a further strengthening of consumer demand in anticipation of the Seventh Pay Commission's award should propel the economy forward, said the analysts and officials.

> * ""The key challenge was liquidity, particularly in the infra sector and the government has done its bit by boosting capital expenditure in roads and railways,"" said Kant, who has been spearheading the Centre's initiative to make doing business in the country easier as well as the Make in India campaign, resulting in the increased flow of foreign investment.The government has sought to press ahead with policy changes despite resistance from the opposition on some key changes.

> * In this slow pace, most of the data will not look positive; there could be ups and down,"" said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist, India Ratings & Research.

> * ""The likely stimulus from the upcoming Seventh Pay Commission, further monetary easing of 25-50 basis points, the thrust on public investments coupled with structural reforms such as the goods and services tax (GST) and ease of doing business are likely to aid the process of recovery, said Citigroup's Anurag Jha in a note.

"India, America and the geopolitical chessboard: America’s ruthless self-interest seeks an India that is strong enough to act as a regional counter to China but weak enough to be kept in check by rogue Pakistan.",21,2w7l4p,http://www.dailyo.in/opinion/india-america-and-the-geopolitical-chessboard-foreign-policy-barack-obama-narendra-modi/story/1/2102.html,19,,Fluttershy_qtest," Of course. They are not propping up India because of goodness of their heart. Did anyone applaud the masterstroke that was Sri Lanka. A regime change was bought about certainly due to Indian influence which India will not confirm or deny. This will certainly has upset China, as Rajapakse was China's sweetheart. Modi's foreign policy is look east which IMHO will reap benefits.  This is the statement I have been barking from past 2 years everywhere , But I always get shitty replies -"" times have changed, we should forget Russia "" , ""we are democracies"", we are that or we are this. Simple thing No Super power will allow other countries to develop, which may challenge them, in 1970's they sucked Chinese to oppose soviet union, Now they want relations with India to stop china, tomorrow they do same thing against India with Pakistan .  In 2014, a slow year for the Indian economy, India grew at a rate of somewhere around 5%. (Estimates vary from 7-4.x, so 5% is a reasonable middle of the ground number.) 

This meant an addition to Indian GDP of about 100 billion dollars. In comparison, Pakistan has an economy of around 245 billion dollars.

So in a bad year, India will add to its economy half a Pakistan, and in a good year, India will add to its economy one full Pakistan. In a decade or two, the relative economic disparity between India and Pak, which is at 10:1 today, will be around 20:1.

How can such a tiny power, that cannot keeps its own children safe, keep India in check? American strategic thinkers are many thing, but math illiterate they are not. 

Forget these conspiracy theories peddled by foolish NAM types, and too clever by half hidden-Islamists, and venture forth boldly into the future.  I don't believe that the American political system is capable of long term/very long term foreign policy strategies this article proposes it's doing. 

America's foreign policy is like any other country's foreign policy, just reacting to what pops up day to day. Somedays you're an enemy, and somedays you're a friend. ",Policy/Economy,2015-02-18 01:16:55
How would rank the Indian Prime Ministers from 1947-2014?,18,22ulu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/22ulu8/how_would_rank_the_indian_prime_ministers_from/,43,"Rank them on whatever criteria you feel is important. 

In chronological order:
Jawaharlal Nehru (1947-1964)

Gulzari Lal Nanda A (1964-1964)

Lal Bahadur Shastri (1965-1966)

Indira Gandhi (1966-1984)

Morarji Desai (1977-1979)

Rajiv Gandhi (1984-1989)

VP Singh (1989-1990)

PV Narasimha Rao (1991-1996)

HD Deve Gowda (1997)

AB Vajpayee (1999-2004)

Dr Manmohan Singh (2004-)

Didn't include the cases where the tenure was extremely short. 


EDIT: Ugh, missing a word in the title, supposed to have a ""you"" in there. 

",Brownhops," It's very hard to ""rank"" PMs like this, because a ranking suggests a single axis. Most PMs have mixed track records, good in some areas, crap in others. 

Since a lot of posters here are quite young, I'll try to cover some of the older PMs:

 * **Nehru**: [4/10]: His economic theories (Fabian socialism) made India suffer, some of his appointments were disastrous (Krishna Mennon), he was geopolitically naive (Panchsheel, UN security council, Sino-Indian war), his political machinations kept some capable men away from power (Patel). In general, he was indecisive and weak. But OTOH, I have to admit that overall he was better than 99% of the other options at that time - his personal stature imbued the PMO with a sense of dignity, he was pretty good as a figurehead - he could speak well and if he had left governance to the officials and confined himself to the ceremonial role, I think he would have been remembered well.

* **Shastri**: [7/10]: Bit of a surprise package. During his early days in office, he'd kept a pretty low profile, almost like late-term MNS. But he rose to the occasion in 1965, when confronted with Pak's Op Grand Slam.  He authorized the military to open a second front - a decisive move that helped India militarily and restored some of the confidence lost in 1962, both among the services and the civilian population

* **Desai**: [1/10]: Fucking disaster. Disgrace to the office of the PM

* **Charan Singh**: N/A: Nonentity but at least not an idiot like Desai

* **Indira Gandhi**: [6/10]: Probably the most divisive of India's PMs. A lot of people overlook that her two terms were very different - her second term was much more low-profile than the 1st one. But overall, she made many mistakes. The emergency of course, but also her nationalization drive (consummating India's flirtation with socialism started by her dad) and her overt political dealings. (FWIW, I don't think her political machinations were any worse than the others', she just carried them out more openly, and broadened her scope of influence, opening the door to other politicians doing the same). She also handled the Khalistan situation badly - Op Blue Star... well, that was a crying shame. On the flip side, she was the most decisive PM India has had - she knew when to get out of the way and let the professionals do their job. India's profile rose with the Asian games, CHOGM and other events on her watch. Most importantly, she handled 1971 perfectly - a lot of folks don't understand *how* badly it could have ended for India, given the US position and the localized issues in Bangladesh, Punjab and Pakistan. That the country came out on top is nothing short of incredible

* **Rajiv**: [4/10]: Pretty much a nonentity, wasted years for India.

* **VP Singh**: [2/10]: Mandal and other BS

* **Gujral**: [3/10]: Personal probity aside, his Gujral doctrine was a fucking mess. Still, at least he had some ideas, shitty though they were My top 3 in chornological order - ( Shastri had too short a stint to know for sure) 

1- Nehru - Made huge mistakes but setup the way things work in India. We have adjusted some minor things but Indian economy's most important features work the way his team designed- Socialist 5 yr Planning, Non-aligned diplomacy, federal structure where center is all powerful, central institutions of great quality like AIIMS, IIT, IIM 

There is no major change apart from liberalization in 1992 that any PM has done to the precedents laid out by him.

2- PV Narsimha Rao - Gave all of us McDonalds and private sector jobs. Without him liberalizing economy, we would be the at least 20-30% poorer as a nation and individually. 

3-  AB Vajpayee - Made major changes to the way India was conducting diplomacy and re-started the process of structural changes PVNR had brought in.  Was Shastri instrumental in anything other than winning the Pak war. Yes, that is a big one, but I have heard people being so impressed with Lal Bahadur Shastri, that I want to know what else did he do? 1. Indira Gandhi (8/10): Split Pakistan into two pieces...this victory is the greatest Indian victory since the Marathas defeated the Mughals. Also, she convinced the Sikhs that an independent country in northwestern India will not even be discussed.  Can you imagine how horrible it would be to have a country that plays Pak and India against each other and shelters agents from both sides?

2. Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, VP Singh, Chandra Shekar, IK Gujral, HD Deve Gowda (7/10). These prime ministers proved that India was not a Single-Party state. They provided the first viable opposition to Congress and showed that whoever wins an election in India will peacefully take power. Also, these Janata Dal governments were among the first to have leaders from Middle-Caste and Lower-Middle Castes...this integrated these communities into democratic India by assuring them that India belonged to them too. Deve Gowda is especially important because he assured non-Brahmin dravidians that India would not treat them like 2nd Class citizens. 

3. Atal Bihari Vajpayee (6.99/10) for improving the budged deficit, undertaking infrastructure projects and for establishing a permanent and resilient opposition party. 

4. PV Narasimha Rao (6.98/10) for liberalizing the economy. Also he was the first non-Nehru dynasty person to serve a 5 year term. This is why his memory is erased in the Congress party...they don't want to acknowledge that the Congress can thrive without the Family. 

5. Manmohan Singh (4/10). For making India enter into some nice nuclear deals. Also, though he was largely a figurehead, at least he made sure an Italian didn't become PM. It would have been might embarrassing for a country known for anti-imperialism to be ruled voluntarily by a European. I know Sonia largely (but not completely) ran the show behind the scenes but still symbolism is important and I'm glad Manmohan was the PM representing India overseas. 

6. The rest were not really consequential positive or negative. 



 Nehru: 8/10. Passed the Hindu bills in spite of opposition from almost all pro Hindu organizations. If not for him Hindus today would have been in same state as Muslims. His relationship with Edwina Mountbatten helped India a lot in partition. Sure he erred on Kashmir but Kashmir anyway could have gone either ways. He is the reason we have democracy. While almost every post colonial democracy failed, India thrived because of him. He actually believed in democracy. Had he died 5-10 years earlier, India would surely have lapsed into dictatorship. His economic philosophies were alright for his times but were carried on for long because of his family being in power. 

Atal Bihari Vajpayee: 7/10. Mistake on Kargil but India coped well. Went big on infrastructure, the best thing to happen. Very few scams during his time compared to any other PM.

Narsimha Rao: 6/10 Started liberalization and helped India break from stagnation.

Shastri: 5/10 Led India well, clean image. Had promise.

Indira Gandhi: 4/10 Emergency and some extreme socialist decision notwithstanding she did well in operation Bluestar and 71 war.

Rajiv Gandhi/Manmohan Singh: -5/10 Took India years back.

Everyone else: 0 they were just holding onto their chair. Confession: I don't know much about PMs before Rajeev, other than Indira. Hence, my rankings:


1. AB Vajpayee (1999-2004) - True globalization. Stable economy, low inflation. Honorable foreign policy, good handling of Kargil. 

2. PV Narasimha Rao (1991-1996) - Good handling of BoP crisis. Tried to make a break from Gandhi Dynasty.

The rest are worthy of contempt:

Negative 1,000,000 - Indira Gandhi (1966-1984) - Started India's love affair with all that's evil today, from sloth and corruption to ineptitude and greed. India's Hitler and Castro rolled into one. May she rot in hell.

Negative 1000 - Rajiv Gandhi (1984-1989) - Perpetuated Momma's stupidities, fine tuned vote bank politics, first PM level corruption.

Negative 500 - Dr Manmohan Singh (2004-) - Took India from ""growing economy"" to ""stagnated economy"" and now disaster story

Negative 500 - VP Singh (1989-1990) - Mandal Commission, indecisive on key policy points

The rest (post Rajeev) are idiots. 1. Narasimha Rao
2. Vajpayee 


3. Manmohan Singh (UPA 1 only)
4. Lal Bahadur shastri (just for winning the war)
 gujral missing in the list?! Shastri - Best Ever
Indira Gandhi - Strong leader..though misuse of power but stability
AB VP - Nuff Said
Nehru - Guided through nascent democracy years
PV N - Filled the void in bringing open markets
VP - Alternative
RG - Unable to use absolute majority to guide india and set up as a success
MMS - Do I even type
Moraji Desai - Opened can of worms of bad governments
Charan Singh - Why was he PM
Nanda - Filler...served his purpose
Deve Gowda - Classic example of what is wrong with Indian electoral system
Chandra Shekar - If there is a way to make this unhappen, please look into it. ModiAll others I don't know PMs before ABVP, so my order is short:

1. Vajpayee
2. Manmohan Singh

But if I'll have to go by what I've read and heard:

Vajpayee

Nehru*

Narasimha Rao

Indira Gandhi*

* excluding their blunders, which seems to almost nullify and makes them a bad one.

Ones I dislike:

Manmohan Singh

Rajiv Gandhi

Indira Gandhi

Nehru

Yep, they make both of my lists. 1 : modi

2 : ABV

3 : LBS

4 : Nehru

5 : PVNR

IMO, FSB is a good bill, passed at the wrong time. OP, you have spent your time writing stuff up - educating people and sharing something you believe in and that itself is commendable. 

Most people don't even know the basics of economy - so this post could be a good starting point for further discussions. I saw somebody calling you out as a socialist - and that shows how under-educated even our elite is(assuming those on /r/india are elites). You could perhaps expand more on why our government decided to spend a large amount of cash on welfare policies and compare the same with few first world nations. 

Personally, I believe govt should just focus on governing and the rest should be left to the economy. They do a bad job at everything they touch so policies like National Corruption Guarantee Scheme are bound to fail in India. But even while I say that, the policies themselves are not that bad. Guaranteed employment, food, education etc are all very good and noble ideas. Hopefully, someday we will have a stronger economy to implement these ideas well.  Does it mean that if a lot of people stop using cars value of Rupee may go up?

Also good work OP. I think it's a combination of both the export/import gap as explained, but also the result of economic slowdown in India and continued questions about India's fiscal responsibilities.

Perhaps a decisive moment in history of India. Anna Announces party. What's your take ?,32,xmb9m,http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Team-Anna-to-form-political-party-to-fight-corruption-confirms-Kejriwal/Article1-907640.aspx,53,,identity_none," I would like to know their stand/opinion on other stuff before deciding to vote for them.

One of their team members Prasanth Bushan is a staunch supporter of Azaadi assholes of kashmir.He wants India to give up kashmir. 
Other members such as Aruna Roy openly bat for maoists . and they don't have a opinion on economics etc. If they manage to come to power , it will be Gandhi/Nehru redux and will be a disaster. I hope they do well. Thing I am afraid is that it might split the opposition vote and give Congress another win. One more term for Congress and I think we are doomed. Should give them one chance. Things couldn't be worse anyway Sooner or later he will have to open his mouth to voice his opinions on issues other than corruption and quite frankly he is a simpleton.

Lets hope he focuses completely on the corruption agenda, gets enough votes to be, at the very least, a strong enough voice as part of a coalition with any of the two parties and force them into implementing greater transparency measures and strong anti corruption laws. Where is the party? Will they serve drinks? Nothing is going to happen. For a party to be successful funds are needed. No one's going to back up Anna. We suffer from a lack of options in politics so I welcome any serious attempt to break the two party system. Unfortunately this party will probably be very extreme in most things. ref: AH saying alcoholics should be hanged and ambivalence on separatist issues. This is silly. Now they will just split the anti-incumbency vote, which would have gone to the BJP, and let Congress win again. They have no source of funding and no agenda. Heck, they dont even have unity within their own group!! Only Kejriwal and his coterie may think contesting elections is a good idea. You cant win elections like this. They'd have done better if they had remained an NGO and campaigned against corrupt candidates by making the public more aware of who the right candidate is. Now the whole anti-corruption thing is going to fizzle out. I would really like to see them do well, but ""Power Corrupts"". Also, some of his comments on personal freedoms are disturbing. They're likely to merge with the NDA. I can see this turning into a grand failure. Anna knows zilch about running a country and Swami Ramdev is only advocating the Hindutva brand of politics. 

The Indian economy will be in a deeeep slump if these clowns actually come to power.  how does he plan to get enough candidates to make a impact ?

From facebook ??  What would be a good name for the party? Why not - the have struck a chord with apathetic India and made uninterested middle classes think, and make their voices heard. Their strategies are not working to their specific objective, but their larger objectives can be met only politically.

Let them give it a shot. I am not sure if they will be able to even get a single seat in parliament, but if they have a long term view and can hold the group together, they may have a chance. Well they'll never be credible enough for me.With the maoist and the azadi douches supporters on their team,they can expect  nothing more than a middle finger salutes from me. Here, I was hoping parties like LokSatta would do better. You either need experienced personnel or intellectuals in your party to form a stable government once elected. Anna's party currently has neither and I don't see experienced politicians joining the party. The success of Anna's party will solely depend on how many real intellectuals(from varying disiplines) he is able to attract.  [I will quote myself](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/xk0pf/team_anna_asks_india_should_we_start_a_political/c5n27p3), also, I can see me being flogged coz I drink and do not pray or go to temple etc. 99% of voters in India vote based on caste,liquor and money so sadly I can't see this party having much impact on the elections.",Policy/Economy,2012-08-03 22:01:07

Earlier this month in Japan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his government seeks to pursue economic policies that will make India “the most open economy in the world”. His statement was lost amid the domestic din following his controversial decision to pull high-value banknotes out of circulation.

Chinese President Xi Jinping made a similar point on the sidelines of a conference in Peru. He pledged to further open up the Chinese economy so that the benefits of economic integration were shared more widely. These parallel statements by the leaders of the two largest emerging economies come at a time when protectionist sentiment is gradually casting a long shadow in the developed world, especially after the election of Donald Trump as the next US president. Global trade by value has also been shrinking.

The backlash against globalization in several rich countries is because a growing numbers of voters there believe that free trade has harmed them, as jobs have moved to Asia. A robust debate is still under way among economists whether technology has been a bigger reason why median incomes have stagnated in these countries, but the dominant narrative blames free trade.

The situation in India and China is quite different. Millions have been pulled out of poverty because of the opportunities offered by globalization. Economist Branko Milanović has provided one of the most evocative visuals of what he has described as the greatest reshuffle in global incomes in the past three centuries. His elephant diagram shows that the two groups that have seen the most rapid rise in incomes in the two decades after 1988 are the few in the top income percentile (the global elite) and the hundreds of millions around the median income (mainly people from India and China).

This fact partly explains why leaders such as Modi and Xi are committing themselves to open economies even while Western countries that originally pushed for globalization are getting attracted to protectionism. Their middle class has been one of the undisputed beneficiaries of globalization, and hence has a strong interest in more economic integration with the rest of the world.

But what precisely does being the most open economy in the world entail? Modi did not provide any details. Trade policy has definitely become less restrictive since the advent of economic reforms: import tariffs that were once among the highest in the world have come down dramatically. The goal set by the initial reformers that average tariff levels should come down to East Asian levels has been met. There is no doubt that the old protectionist walls have been dismantled.

The trade-policy reforms over the past 25 years have also resulted in better trade outcomes. The trade/gross domestic product ratio has doubled. India, however, can never reach the levels of openness of a country such as Singapore because of its size. Smaller countries tend to have a higher trade ratio because their domestic markets aren’t big enough.

The record is less encouraging when it comes to trade in services, despite the success of the software services industry. Trade in services usually increases in tandem with prosperity, so India still has some distance to go. The other two indicators of openness are restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) and capital account controls. India has far fewer FDI restrictions, though some sectoral caps persist, but the experience of China shows that there is an umbilical link between higher FDI and more international trade.

India has also brought down most of its barriers to capital inflows, though there are still controls. The standard measure for capital account openness—the Chinn-Ito index—shows that India has far more controls on capital flows compared to its peers. The traditional view within the economic policy establishment has been that capital-account convertibility should be a gradual process, and deeply dependent on durable macroeconomic stability as well as a strong banking system. The Modi government has as yet shown no sign that it has broken with this convention.

India is definitely a far more open economy than it was before the economic reforms of 1991. Millions of Indians have benefitted from its integration with the global economy, though that has increased the income gap between those who could take advantage of globalization and those who could not. India and China should be important voices in the protection of the liberal international order—both through a more active role in global institutions and through domestic reform that advances the cause of global economic integration.

Should India and China stand up for globalization when its advocates are dwindling across the developed world? Tell us at views@livemint.com

Replying to Jairam Ramesh of Congress, who raised the issue of ensuring complete autonomy for the IITs, Javedekar said the HRD Ministry is not there on any board of IITs.

On funding for the premier institutes, he said there would not be any financial constraints for growth of IITs.



The government is already working on a scheme for financing higher education infrastructure needs, particularly research infrastructure requirements, he added.

> * In this context, it is no surprise that when Andre Malraux, French culture minister, asked Nehru what his greatest difficulty since Independence was, he had replied: Creating a just state by just means. After a brief pause, he had added: Perhaps, too, creating a secular state in a religious country.

> * Years later, when Nirad babu had become sharply critical of Nehru, the worst he said of the prime minister was: He is our ineffectual angel. John Kenneth Galbraith, an economic guru, former US ambassador to India and a personal friend of Nehru, has put it more succinctly: With Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru was, indeed, India: Gandhi was its history; Nehru, after Independence, its reality.

> * Another distinguished American, Dean Acheson, who was secretary of state during Nehrus first visit to the US in 1949, has recorded in his memoirs, Present At The Creation, that he found Nehru to be prickly, arrogant and one of the most difficult men to deal with.

> * Yet, he added: India was so important to the world and Nehru so important to India that  as Voltaire said of God  if he did not exist, he would have to be invented. My humble submission is that in the glittering galaxy that marches in the multi-coloured procession of modern India history, Nehru walks a few steps behind his mentor and master, the Mahatma, but much ahead of all others.

 I'm socially on the left wing, but right wing when it comes to economics. I'm totally for a free market economy. I wish India would adopt the [Nordic model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model).  >Instead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like Western Europe or Scandinavia, why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?

Sorry but your understanding of economics seems to be flawed. India is a mixed economy - State and Private sector are involved in production and it is not a free market economy, but a heavily regulated economy in which the state intervenes to correct the natural equilibrium of demand & supply.

The model you are referring to is the Nordic model (Social Market Economy to use the technical term). In this the type of set up there is actually more free market than the crony free market of the US or other ""free market"" economies.

A Nordic model is one that is capitalistic but tempered by an implementation of Ordoliberalism which says markets are free, competition decides if companies thrive or fall BUT there will be regulation to ensure fair competition.

>why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?

Who wants to move to a free market corpotocracy? What (and I generalise) a lot of young Indians want is labour law reforms, more transparent rule making while reducing discretionary nonsense that is the cornerstone of Indian bureaucracy right now, support for infrastructure and consequently letting the private sector do what it does best. Make money, create goods & services while creating jobs. Nobody says that we shouldn't invest tax money in poverty alleiviation programs or investing in infrastructure or run schools & hospitals or any such thing! What we want is an end to the Maai-Baap sarkaari model that the CONgress has imposed upon this nation for 50 years. A model in which the government uses hand-outs to control votes, while keeping the nation poor and dependant on the government for their daily bread & butter.

>Why do we want leaders like Narendra Modi to be like Ronald Regan or Hitler ? Wouldn't Franklin D Roosevelt be a better role model ? FDR took America out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in American history.

This is the second time I am seeing your admiration for FDR and not questioning that, but what do you understand of his policies?

Have you truly looked at Modi's economic philosophies? Till Kujliwala said crony capitalism, nobody ever accused Modi / Guj of crony capitalism. 

Anyways, back to the topic on hand,

FDR's key solutions to recovery were as follows,

* Recovery of the Agriculture sector
* Create jobs at stable wages (in reality though, wages dipped while the number of jobs created increased-check wages paid out via the WPA if you need clarity on this)
* Using a fiscal deficit (atleast in the 1st & 2nd New Deals) to fund the WPA to create infrastructure.
* Increased corporate taxation (it is another matter that this was absolutely watered down)

There are other Fiscal policies / Monetary policies which I will not discuss now as it is not relevant to the point I am trying to make below.

Look at Modi's Gujarat minus whatever blinkers you might have.

* The only state to have grown it's Primary (agriculture) sector at 10% plus, while the rest of the country grew at roughly 2%. While critics point out to other ""advanced states"" like Maha or TN and compare GDP growth rates, keep in mind the growth patterns of these states is NOT SUSTAINABLE. They have moved directly from a primary economy to a tertiary economy skipping entirely the manufacturing phase which is where jobs are created.

* As a net share - Manufacturing+Agriculture contribute roughly 60% of the states GDP, while in states like Maha and TN this would be at a paltry 35%. Keep in mind, nationally Agri+Manufacturing account for close to 70% of all employment.

* State with the LOWEST unemployment figures - The above thrust on the primary & secondary are paying off. Jobs are being created. Have real wages dipped? yes, but that is more of a function of demand & supply equilibirum and less of ""Evil Adani pays less hurr durr"". 

* Taxation in Guj (despite all accusations of crony capitalism aside) has increased, it has the highest contribution of tax revenue as a percentage of total revenue is at 80% which is the highest in the country! Clearly, all that free land is paying off in the form of increased state taxes.

How does any of the above equate to crony capitalism? Why would a crony capitalist develop the primary sectory where 60% of our population works? If anything, thrust on the agricultural sector+increased job creation+increased taxation were aside from the fiscal tweakings a corner stone of FDR's New Deal.

Truly you seem to be spouting the same gibberish less informed people spout, you might want to look at the macro economic indicators before you come to any conclusions.

Not every Chaddi wearing Sanghi is a brain dead communalist, some of us have decided to vote for him more because of his economic policies and not for whatever else people vote for him.

>I think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like Russia or any of the South American countries. Why do people want to move from one corrupt system to another ?

Really? Simply take a list of the big name MNC's and Indian manufacturing powerhouses operating out of Guj and Adani / Ambani would be just one amongst the Fords, Samsungs, Peugeots, Renaults, Lakshmi Steels, Mahindra's, Tata's etc etc. It is sad that off all the bad things Kujliwala has done, he has used his goodwill in convincing people that Modi's gujarat supports crony capitalism! Not much original thought in this. Essentially your entire question = ""they are doing, why aren't we?""

>Outside of sources like Fox news, western media is deeply cynical of unregulated capitalism - especially after the global financial crisis of 2007-8. The same general idea is reflected in the educated youth/college grads in the developed world too.

Neither the media, nor the students, are contributing to their nations' growth.

>Why does India have the complete opposite attitude towards economics ?

Because it's required. The kids joining International Socialist Organization live in first world countries that can afford unemployment benefits.

>Instead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like Western Europe or Scandinavia, why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?

Because we have the largest number of extremely poor people. We need to make money to feed them.

>Why do we want leaders like Narendra Modi to be like Ronald Regan or Hitler ? Wouldn't Franklin D Roosevelt be a better role model ? FDR took America out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in American history.

Ronald Reagan was one man's comparison. In any case, all American presidents have sworn by free enterprise, it's only their socialism that has varied in degrees. Modi is pro-welfare too, just not a welfare state to the exclusion or detriment of private enterprise.

>Is it just an overextension after years of misrule under the Congress party ? I don't want to believe that Indians are inherently more selfish than everybody else.

Selfish is a good thing. We want to make money. We want to pay taxes. We want the poor to be helped, but don't hold us back from our own destinies.

>I think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like Russia or any of the South American countries. Why do people want to move from one corrupt system to another ?
Personally I doubt there will be any major change in economic or foreign policy no matter who comes to power, but the mentality of India's urban educated youth is interesting.

Meh. Your p.o.v is too popular and stopped being relevant after the BOP crisis.

**India has no option. If not Modi, then someone from the economic right.** I believe it is mostly due to a false sense of entitlement and upbringing, The fact that you have had a decent life and have never had to live through abject poverty leads to apathy towards the underprivileged. So you tend to root for policies that will benefit your current standing, which in case of educated young Indians are the right wing policies. Because America and the west have strayed in too much to the right. We have strayed on too much to the left. You're comparing two different things. On the political scale, I am a left-social libertarian. Economically, I am liberal but to an extent. I believe in laissez-faire capitalism but with government oversight and regulation to prevent monopolies, pollution, and gouging customers. Essentially, rules that would apply to an individual to ensure the harmonious functioning of society, should apply to a corporation as well.

Now if the economic climate is way to the right of me, I would look like I am on the left of the spectrum. In an economic climate that is way to the left of me, I would look like I am on the right of the spectrum.

The first case applies to the US. I have been here since '99. I think the economic policies are pretty much brain-dead and have gone too far to the right. Intense deregulation is what led to the financial crisis of '08. Corporations have way too much power, and you essentially have state-sanctioned monopoly ensured by the revolving door between corporations and Washington (current head of FCC used to work for Comcast for example). 

In India, you have the other extreme. Far-left policies and the disastrous experimentation with Fabian socialism have stunted the economy and slowed down development. The Indian economy is comparatively hostile to entrepreneurship, although the situation is way better than it was, say 20 years ago. In fact, it was a combination of Nehru's and Indira's policies that brought India to the brink of bankruptcy in '89/'90, and it was only because of liberalization at that point that India's economy was saved. The additional liberalization during the NDA years also helped.

So this, in short, is why I favor regulation in the US, but deregulation in India. What India needs to do is learn from the mistakes the US made and not go too far in that direction. Because India is too far to the left economically relative to the US. You can't equate the current right wing of US with anything. According to their principles even their past governments would have been considered liberal. **Attention!** Please keep in mind that the OP of this thread has chosen to mark this post with the **[R]eddiquette Enforced** tag.

> western media is deeply cynical of unregulated capitalism - especially after the global financial crisis of 2007-8

This is essentially the biggest criticism of capitalism. If you have analysed financial crises you will see only one pattern - no two crises are similar. You know why? Because after every crisis we learn a new thing about how economy can go wrong. In the 2007-08, Wall Street didn't understand the risks of what they were doing completely. Now we have better sense and hence are trying to implement Basel-3. I'm sure there will be more crises and each time we will learn a new thing.

tl;dr: 2007-08 crisis doesn't mean capitalism is bad. ",Policy/Economy,2014-05-08 16:00:13

India’s policies are being crafted to help strengthen its competitive advantage in a globalizing world. But what happens if the basis of that globalization changes? The UK’s recent decision to exit the European Union—popularly termed Brexit—has been touted as an indicator of the end of globalization. While we at the BCG Henderson Institute believe this view is rather extreme, our research concludes that the nature of globalization is indeed changing. In order to thrive in the next phase of globalization, India needs to act quickly—and differently.



Globalization of the past



India was a big beneficiary of the globalization phase, starting in the late 1980s, that led to rapid economic growth in emerging markets (EMs) on the back of outsourcing and trade. This phase witnessed the widespread adoption of the Internet, the outsourcing of low-cost manufacturing and services, and the development of globally integrated supply chains.



Consequently, India’s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at a compound annual growth rate of 6.5% between 1990 and 2010, representing a significant improvement over the 4.3% average economic growth recorded between 1970 and 1990. Export of services to developed economies accounted for the bulk of this expansion, with the share of services jumping from 40.3% of GDP in 1980 to 45% in 1990, and to 55% in 2010. Services export growth almost quadrupled, from 4.5% during the 1980-90 period to 17.5% between 1990 and 2010. India’s integration with the global economy was made possible by the liberalization reforms initiated as a result of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) structural adjustment programmes in the early 1990s. Further, institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) which were set up to create uniform “rules of the game” enabled greater trade between countries.



This model of globalization prevalent since the late 1980s was, however, not unique. Our study of globalization, spanning the late 1800s to date, shows that globalization has phases of growth and periods of transition, usually triggered by a crisis event. Although each phase differs from the previous one, all of them follow the same model. This model comprises three forces (see below).



• First—a new “technology” (referred to in the broadest sense) was leveraged by a country or a set of countries to boost productivity and output.



• Second—one or more countries served as an economic “pole”, which became the global growth engine. Western European countries, the US and China played this role in the first, second and third phase of globalization, respectively, driving 20-25% of world GDP growth, and around 15% of the growth in global trade. This, in turn, fuelled economic activity in other countries, especially the trading partners of the “poles”.



• Third—a favourable system of global governance facilitated cross-border financial flows and trade through the enforcement of stable “rules of the game”.



Together, these forces have fostered a virtuous cycle of economic growth and greater global integration, ensuring that global economics took precedence over local politics.



However, our research shows that this model of globalization is unlikely to repeat itself. New, emerging technologies are expected to see fundamentally different adoption patterns from those seen in the previous waves. And, governance structures will undergo transformative changes, necessitating compliance with multiple, often conflicting, global rules.



Globalization: What next?



Technological disruption: While new digital “technologies” (robotics, digital services, global platforms) are emerging which are beginning to impact productivity, they will not be able to create the same virtuous cycle of rapid economic growth through trade of goods to create a new global growth pole. Unlike in the past, digital technologies are not “dominated” by one or few countries. This marks a major deviation from previous cycles, where countries such as the US and China leveraged their competitive advantages in mass manufacturing and low-cost production, respectively, to emerge as the world’s economic “pole”. Further, the adoption of digital technologies across various industries will result in more localized manufacturing and globalized services, giving rise to very different trade patterns. Additionally, rapid, large-scale replacement of old manufacturing technologies by newer, digital ones is unlikely, given the growing unavailability of enough skilled workers like robot programmers. Rising income inequality and the need to protect jobs could also bring in stringent regulations, slowing the adoption of disruptive technologies.



New governance structures: The stable “rules of the game” set by the Bretton Woods institutions and the Group of Seven nations are now changing, with the Group of 20 states playing an increasingly influential role. This is likely to create new winners and losers. In the previous phases of globalization, there was a fair degree of long-term alignment between economics and politics. Today, the WTO-governed free trade regime is making way for more bilateral and regional partnerships and possibly mega-regional and sub-regional trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, although the latter has been stalled. There is growing protectionism across both developed and emerging markets. The multilateral financial architecture is getting decentralized, with China and other prominent developing countries teaming up to establish new institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and New Development Bank (NDB). There is also growing influence of state capitalism on capital allocation worldwide, through multiple levers such as direct acquisition of private companies, investments via sovereign wealth funds, and loans and subsidies for the development of certain domestic industries.



The Fourth Wave of Globalization



These shifts in geopolitics, and the trade and financial architectures point to a growing divergence between economics and politics. This has the potential to create greater uncertainty and volatility, as well as a country-region centricity in decision-making, hindering global integration. The market is losing ground to the state and labour advantage is giving way to digital advantage. These trends are driving the emergence of a new model of globalization.



It is unlikely that export-led trade growth, a core feature of the old model, will continue to be the primary driver of GDP growth going forward. The new model will be different on all three key dimensions



Growth: The new model will see a shift away from the “pole” model of economic growth, and vocabulary of developed economies versus EMs, to that of a multipolar world. Countries will have varied growth trajectories, with many EMs becoming less reliant on exports and focusing more on boosting domestic demand. Meanwhile, developed economies and China are likely to grow through greater increases in productivity and de-bottlenecking of the economy through internal structural reforms.



●Technology: In the previous phase, global value chains were designed to be cost-optimized and relied on a dominant “technology” of low-cost manufacturing driven by labour cost advantage in emerging economies. In the next phase, these will give way to complex multi-technology value chains that blend digital technology with the earlier low-cost technologies. We will also see greater integration across products and services. Moreover, global platforms (for example, marketplaces like Amazon and Alibaba) are likely to assume increasing importance, as companies rely on these platforms for exchange of goods and services, rather than investing in their own asset-heavy supply chains.



Governance: The “rules of the game” will become more complex with the emergence of a multi-institutional governance architecture, wherein regional and local regulations will coexist alongside global rules, balancing national political interests with global multilateral economic agendas.



What does this mean for India?



New policies are currently being enacted that will allow India to build a global competitive advantage going forward. However, these policies are unlikely to yield maximum payoffs unless they can be reset for the next phase of globalization. The emerging fourth wave of globalization requires India to dramatically rethink its policy priorities for the next 15-20 years.



Shifting income pyramid, digital boom and expanding urban agglomerations will drive India’s economic growth in the next decade

>* NEW DELHI: Projecting stable growth rate for India, Moody's Investors Service on Monday said the economy would grow at 7.5 per cent in the current fiscal and improve marginally in the following year.

>* ""These growth rates would be slightly faster than the 7.4 per cent recorded in FY15 and substantially better than from FY12 to FY14,"" it said in a report, adding ""India's economic growth will remain stable"".

>* ""An accommodative monetary policy should support the growth environment,"" it added.India's average annual expansion of 7.7 per cent over the past decade is one of the fastest growth rates globally, as its favorable demographics and the opportunities afforded by a large and diverse national market with high levels of savings have overcome the effects of weak physical infrastructure and sometimes disjointed policies.However, during this long growth period, the country experienced a significant slowdown in FY12-13 driven in part by policy bottlenecks impacting project investments, the report said.

>* There has been a focus on improving the ease of doing business, particularly with respect to approvals required from the government,"" it said citing increase in limits on FDI in key sectors like defence and insurance.Further, there has also been a pick-up in public-sector investments, particularly in areas such as railways and roads, to compensate for the weak levels of private-sector capital investment, it added.The report also notes that India has weathered the recent volatility in emerging markets much better than peers, as seen in the relatively modest deterioration in the currency, ""indicating that investor sentiment remains supportive"" of the country's economic outlook.

>* ""It is pertinent to highlight here that, in contrast to a few other emerging markets, India is a key beneficiary of decline in commodity prices, especially oil,"" the report said.

First a bit of rant - as per the guidelines, I cannot alter the title of this link. As a result, BJP/AAP supporters just upvote/downvote this post just based on link, which MIGHT result into non-conveyance of my frustration with this news article.

Tavlin Singh has completely lost it. While her criticism of UPA's economic policy is justified, she is completely blind in her devotion to Modi. Some issues with this article

- She has already established that Modi is going to be the next Prime Minister. Unless she is clairvoyant, we won't know this until May 16th.

- She is under the allusion that Modi's economic policy are somehow going to decrease the rich-poor divide. I seriously doubt so. The rich may become richer and middle class may become affluent, but IMO it would take massive government spending to uplift the economically backward. Mind you, I am not fan of MNREGA or other employment/food schemes either.

- She thinks that in ""rich"" countries, election meetings takes place in air conditioned buildings by swimming pool and white covered chairs. AFAIK, at least in North America, meetings with politicians that involve public discourse either take in city halls or in community centres. Whether you are rich driving a Bentley or a poor taking public transit, you sit side by side on white plastic chair. And I bet, same might be cause of western European countries.

- She somehow seems to be totally oblivious to concept of democratic socialism (I am at a loss of terms due to my ignorance of economic/civics concept). But in countries like Canada, Sweden, UK - government spends huge amount of money on social programmes. Of course, citizens have to pay for this in form of taxes, but at same time this helps to bridge the gap between rich-poor divide. ",Policy/Economy,2014-04-25 21:14:10
Are investors using government's FDI policy to re-pump black money in to the economy? Possibly yes.,5,417lmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/417lmk/are_investors_using_governments_fdi_policy_to/,1,"Bringing FDI is the new mantra for developing Indian economy so much so it is now considered only occupation worth pursuing for Indian PM and FM. Indian PM Modi makes a round trip of the world with impressive slogans and grants to bring much needed money  but little does he know or care at least till now that most of the money that do come to our country is the money that we couldn't collect in the first place. 

While FDI may not be such a bad thing in itself, one still needs to ask what these all FDIs coming to our country consist of and where exactly are they going.

[Rant] India’s BRUTAL tax for the rich,225,ch4zwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ch4zwd/rant_indias_brutal_tax_for_the_rich/,206,"To be honest, I feel this post applies to those who pay tax (regardless of which slab), I’m just putting stuff from my perspective.

There are no two ways to put it, India’s tax on the super rich is ridiculously high. I belong to that super rich community and while paying taxes is not an issue, the amount certainly is. Money doesn’t come easy and I’ve worked hard for it. Meanwhile the government just gives us a big middle finger and increases the taxes. 

Now tell me why would anyone want to live in a developing country with such high tax rates. Before any of you’ll hark on about patriotism and bullshit like that just think logically for a second. For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates. And with the kind of money people from my income category have I can see a lot of them leaving this country for good. 

The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy. What benefits does being wealthy in India get you? Roads are shit, public infrastructure is lacking, incredibly high taxes for luxury items, the list goes on and on.... 
Instead they want to spend my money on statues, stupid ministries like AYUSH, scams, bailing out public sector companies and stuff like that.

Worse, so much money, which I GAVE as tax is being spent to appease the vote bank. Rich farmers are not taxed because the government is afraid to lose them. The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%). (The figures are just examples). We are the source of that money. India is taking a turn to the socialist era, when taxes were even more exorbitant and India was a planned economy. I just wish the government would aggressively try to increase the tax base instead of strangling those who pay tax.

EDIT- I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.",billionaireinindia," At what level of income does 42% tax come in? So apparently there are only 5000 such people with such high income and so the impact on the country is marginal. This exactly is why this form of taxation is bullshit. There are way more than 5000 people earning 2 crore and above in India.

All the rest not only evade taxes, they also are contributing to the black economy beause they will be penalized otherwise. If India has to mop up tax revenue, we need to stop treating rich people as criminals and make it easier for them to consume more. And tax that consumption. I, for one, am for higher taxation for the super-rich. But where I am in total agreement with you is what the money is being used for. If it was for developing the nation and social welfare schemes I am all for it, but right now it just lines the pockets of politicians and gives out doles to the vote banks. This sucks. I don't want to pay taxes to make someone else rich or to help someone be in power.

&#x200B;

If you want to move abroad, most (developed) countries have a higher rate of taxation than us. But of course, in most of those cases the taxes are put in to better use.

[This wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates) compares taxation rates between countries, and you'll see most European countries have a very high tax rate. It can go upto 60% in Scandinavian countries, but then again, in those countries you don't have to pay for education or healthcare. In US, the highest tax rate is 50.5% and in Canada 54% (in Nova Scotia). Even Nepal has a 50% income tax for the super-rich! BTW, I'm curious why you dont buy a US green card though? Under EB5, I think they require 3-4 crore invested and even if invested via brokers and so on I've heard you get most of it back after 5 years... You, my friend, may be an exception. If you belong to a super rich community, you should be Getting TFO of the country. Which is what thousands of French  millionaires did when France passed a ridiculous wealth tax law. 

The smart superrich Indians seem to have got the message too

""Stunningly, India in 2017 suffered a net loss of 7,000 members, or 2 percent, of its millionaire population. ""

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/02/opinion/sunday/millionaires-fleeing-migration.html

you can't fight an economically illiterate government, which is rewarded by the electorate with crushing margins of victory despite its economically insane policies. (see demonetization).  Expect this pattern (crazy economic policies, military adventures to whip up 'patriotism', religious rabble rousing etc)  to repeat when the next elections come around in 2024.

  If I were you, I'd be long gone to a country where  at the *least* those kinds of high taxes would at least get me something in return.

PS: If you are really super rich (and not trolling us) , and don't plan to leave, maybe you can help some fellow randians GTFO? Thanks in advance ;-) I agree with your points. The quality of life is atrocious - high pollution levels , increasing crime , shabby infrastructure and subsidies for everyone apart from the honest tax payers ( white income ). 

If you have the means look at US or Canada and get an OCI card. I know a lot of people who took EB5 visa to US and escaped the drudgery of life in India. why are you living in india? Cattle class here and i completely agree with you. The budget was a total disappointment. A majority govt is of no use if it cannot take difficult steps. 

India need to grow faster and we need rich hardworking smart people to do that. 

Farmers are glorified, the subsidies are the reason why loss making farms continue to work, there is no consolidation of farm lands even after 70 years, consolidated farmlands are necessary for large scale mechanisation and higher productivity level in agriculture.

Consolidation of farmland will provide necessary cheap labor at factories which will attract foreign capital. Till the time foreign investments arrive govt should utilise this cheap labor for large infrastructure projects.

But fuck it all, loot the rich hardworking class and feed the poor. There is no point saying such reasonable things in India. People here want even moderately successful people to be double and triple taxed on the same income and support giving freebies to farmers, even if it means our public discoms go into debt and can’t distribute electricity efficiently, or urban citizens suffer from a drought because 80% of a reservoir’s water has been diverted to appease rich farmers who lobby the government. 

People even on this thread are calling for even more welfare spending, without even realizing that the cumulative effect of welfare spending every year is the reason we have less to invest in infrastructure than East Asian nations. 

The government will laugh at you, swindle you, demean your education and achievements and harrass you or libel you to gain votes, and then cozy up to you if you’re successful. 70+ years after independence and our financial capital floods every year, illiteracy is still high, the trains are miserable compared to those in Europe, flat, even roads are a rarity and corruption is still sky-high. 

There are encouraging signs, but God this country takes great effort to make sure everyone everywhere is miserable. Our tax is marginal tax. That means entire income isn't taxed at 30% only the value which goes above the slab. I used to complain about this when I used to live in India and I used to be in top slab. But the income inequality in India is extreme. If you live in middle class bubble, it's very easy to forget how widespread poverty is in India. 

The wealth gap you see between even a middle class white collar guy and a minimum wage service job guy is insane here. 

There's no way India can provide the same services as developed countries with so much poverty. It's just not going to happen, as we really need the money to develop and maintain our vast rural country. They really need their development a lot more than our services, and that's the harsh reality. Our roads in cities might be crowded and in bad state, but they don't even have enough schools and health facilities. There are no jobs in rural area, farmers are committing suicides. 

As a part of same country, we all contribute to the government in taxes who then has to prioritize who and where it's required. We have obvious issues with random waste and stupid vanity projects, but you cannot treat tax as something which only you should see the entire benefit of. You are subsidising the poor of the country. That's how it's always going to be in every country, but our country has a lot of poverty. 

This is going to get better, but not overnight. it's going to take time. Apart from a few oil rich countries, high income tax for rich people is the norm not the exception. So if you think you are a high net worth individual then you're a free to go to any country in the world but be aware you will pay the same percentage or even more in tax.

&#x200B;

The other point that the tax payer's money is being wasted is a valid one. > The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%).

LMAO Democracy is mob rule with less violence. A certain % of total income as tax to everyone seems plausible. It true what he said ; “rich"" farmers are not taxed much. I have seen farmers taking advantage of *karj maafi* to buy a nice cars. Well making money becomes progressively easier the more money you have. So a progressively higher tax slab isn't wrong.

Whether our tax money is put to good use is a different question. And ofcourse if you have the luxury to move to a different country, you totally should. [deleted]  *Only 6,361 individuals declared incomes of over Rs 5 crore.*   
You are in the 1% of 1% of 1%, aren't you? (Good for you.)

&#x200B;

 *Though the maximum marginal rate of 42.74% tax appears high, it is comparable to the highest tax rates in some other countries. In Germany, the UK, Japan and China, 45% tax rate applies to incomes much below Rs 5 crore annually (taking the current rupee-dollar exchange rate). For example, 45% rate applies to income of Rs 2.04 crore in Germany and Rs 2.53 crore in Japan. In the US, for single tax filers, the top tax rate is 37% for income over Rs 3.42 crore.*

Suggestion: Look into hiring a good accountant. I don't think that even Jeff Bezos paid that much as his personal income tax. I live in Germany and pay 39% tax. I'm not super rich anywhere, or even rich for that matter. So apart from how the money is being used, I really don't see what you are complaining about. Sorry I can't hear the voice of the 1-2 people in India who actually declare income above 5 Cr above the 99% who earn far more than that but show their income as 2.4 LPA. Yes, there is no incentive for super-rich who declare taxes to live in India. Unfortunately it won't make a difference to the economy if the rich people leave, as 90% of the economy is unregulated, cash-based and built on black money. I don't think the government was actually planning on collecting more taxes through this announcement, it will just incentivize the folks who are stuck here and can't leave, to hide their income. This announcement was made just to please the gullible middle class and lower strata into thinking the government is being tough on the ""kaminey"" rich folks. For a suitable bribe, most rich folks can get away with not paying the 42% tax. Arvind Subramaniam in Economic Survey had mentioned this problem of “exit”. 

I totally feel you man, you want the “best” of resources for your tax money. And you should leave the country if you do not like the country, or what it offers. 

Meanwhile, let’s remember Will Durant: A nation is born stoic and dies epicurean. The rest of us cannot emigrate, so we have to make do with what the country has to offer. Or work to improve it.

You mention the “Socialist era” period, I’m guessing your a neo rich. Aka New Money.

Cause in Socialist era, the rich had all the possible amenities, no competition due to inspector raj, and cosy relation with the CONgress party and Bureaucrats.

Nothing wrong with being new money, it’s actually great for the economy that anyone can now become “rich”.

I would like remind you, you have a social debt to your society from which you rose. The Indian Education system, Heath care, subsidised fuel, subsidised LPG etc (economic survey subsidies for the rich). If you emigrate, you would essentially make the government subsidies the foreign government.

Also, there have been cases of racism, xenophobia, and outright eviction of foreigners (Zimbabwe).

If you feel taxes are bad, ask the government to reduce it. Vote for it.

Loan waivers are necessary for YOU also, if the rural economy is in distress, it would create a slowdown in demand, and hence production. Aka Bad for you. Yes loan waivers cannot be a permanent solution, but they are a one time benefit for those, unlike you who would use the resources of the State far more than any farmer would.  

The example is just what aboutism. 

Taxes are your social duty, and let us remember Aristotle who says the feelings of inequality is the biggest cause of revolution. Taxes are redistribution, and beneficial to you as well. You can afford it. Stop whining. The poor have it much tougher. Most rich in India don't even pay (direct) taxes but do massive tax evasion and are crooked to the bone. The rich are overrated. Get a Canadian PR. Curious question, how much do you earn? Less than 100 crores a year or more? >I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.

Good point . Add to it , rampant tax evasion by corporates + Lalas + corrupt fuckers in general > The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies 

This is absolutely hilarious. Rich get tax breaks and benefits of many kind and they have an easier way of avoiding tax than a middle class salaried employee.

I do agree that tax is too high and accountability too low and the system needs to be reformed in a way that incentivizes paying of taxes rather than finding ways to avoid it because that is cheaper alternative. I’ve seen a lot of comments here I wanted to clarify some stuff. First, I’m no Ron Swanson. I gladly pay my taxes on time; however, the amount of tax collected and the way taxes are spent are not mutually exclusive. This may not have been clear in my post. If my money was being spent wisely to actually improve all aspects of the country and to uplift people from poverty I would gladly pay more. But this is not the case. Second, people say that I should leave India (for better or worse). The thing is it’s not that easy. The general perception of people leaving this country is that they out thieves and crooks. If I leave I’m pretty sure I’ll be a fugitive in the eyes of the IT department. I empathize with you OP. Just give us some lessons on how to become like you. Hamari gand chiri hui hai. We need an AMA. https://imgur.com/a/mFgmH0a


If a person is earning 7.5 crores per year he is taxed on average at 35%. Not that hight at all. he will be getting around 5crores in hand.

This is without claiming any tax relief.

I agree with the OP on one this money should be used properly and agriculture income after 10 lakhs should be taxed.

Sorry Would you be willing to do an AMA on randia? You won't have to pay any tax once the revolution happens. And it is gonna happen very soon! Hold on for a while bro :) It didn;t help that a senior official of Ministry of Finance stated that the UHNI should not complain becuase they would consume private services in India and abroad. But that misses the mark completely. 

&#x200B;

Also, this thread is a great read with a lot of interesting facts and conversations in this thread. Congrats everyone. Give me an idea about how rich we are talking about here. 10cr a year and 100cr a year are both rich but the solution would perhaps be different. 42% tax on the super rich is actually lower compared to most developed countries. 
But I do get the issue with where the tax money goes to. 
Also, wastage and abuse of tax revenues is prevelant everywhere to some extent. Only way to make it better is with your vote and organizing  through local communities and questioning your representatives. My only input in this is not to think from your perspective what you are getting but from the perspective of others what the government is providing for them.

Whether you like it or not, the government meal schemes, the national highways the power plants, government run hospitals, cheap transportation and much more is being provided from that tax money. Taxes are higher at that income level similar to most developed countries so it gives you incentive to keep investing.  

Most people reduce their taxes at that income level by profiting from capital gains on investments.  Generally capital gains have lower tax for most countries. >For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates.

Why don't you ? Not being sarcastic here, genuinely curious. Since you have already discounted patriotic reasons , there is zero reason for you to stay here. As much as I believe tax rates should be high on the super rich, I believe that it is curenelty a very unfair system. With less than a quarter people actually paying taxes, it is ridiculous to except the small group of law abiding tax payers to pay higher amounts of money to appease everybody. The government should first focus on making sure everybody pays taxes. Hire an accountant, don't pay tax. LoL! Leave if that helps your like. Higher taxes for the top bracket is logical & universal. The utilization of the tax rupees is a different matter & that’s a valid question irrespective of what tax one pays! I hope that the increase the tax on the super rich even more. i am a salaried person and in the same dilemma as you are in right now. lets say i earn 11 lacs after all deductions and investment shown so i would be paying 30% or \~3lac from my 11lac which is way high. i cant imagine what guys like you feel after paying exhorbitant taxes on income of 3cr you'd pay >1cr as taxes in return of what? no roads no infra no special advantages of being the employment generator. at the same time i believe that you'd have to pay the same amount of taxes elsewhere too isnt it? r/LateStageCapitalism

And what about India's rising income inequality? I am a common middle class salaried tax paying citizen and I do not mind paying a higher tax, if that money reaches the poor. In other governments, it used to reach the pockets of politicians. But with DBT, I am hopeful that it will help someone buy food, or help save newborns or get a better toilet. 

From a purely capitalist perspective, you may hold the view that the poor should earn their money instead of accepting handouts from government. But why are the rich hoarding all the money? Why can't they put it to good use, like funding infrastructure? Giving to charity does not count. 

Poverty is a disease created by the capitalists. It is sickening. If you can, you should definitely try getting out of this country mate. Hi. It's me. Your new best friend. >Tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.

Benefits? Do super rich in other countries use public transportation, public hospitals and public schools and colleges? Even if they do, is it because the public ones are better than the private ones or is it because they cannot afford private ones? If they can easily afford the private ones then your argument is moot. Not to mention, to make money and be rich you need to fight the system at every level. The govt tries its hardest to stop you from making money. And despite everything if you do make money they'll take half of it from you. Agree with OP 100% . I see no change in quality of healthcare, education, and useful infrastructure ( roads, street lights, bridges, highways, police stations etc ). It was literally same 20 years ago. Why would anyone pay taxes? I am willing to pay 50% of my income but i want to see changes and i want to see it being used for welfare of others.  

My friend in Germany pays similar tax but Germany has free colleges, free healthcare and provides €400 a month aid that can't support itself ( providing food, shelter, rent, water etc. State covers all of it. So the money is being used to educate people can't afford to and after years they will be able to get jobs, and pay for their own stuff reducing the dependence on welfare money. 

I get very few people pay taxes in India but we have it tough. If i earn 50k per month and want to support a family of 4, I can't. I don't want to live in a shitty apartment with a Activa. I'd want better quality life, do you know how ridiculous tuition and college fees are? I'd want to save money for it. I'd want to save money for my kid's wedding and help them complete their education. If state can't provide free Universities and jobs, I'd save my money to support them instead of paying taxes. if anything, it is inadequate. if we have to seriously combat the growing wealth inequality and ecological disasters, we need a high inheritance tax as well. passing on anything more than a few crores (not tens, not hundreds) down the generation should be a crime.

&#x200B;

just out of curiosity, what do you do? and how much do you make? To be honest if you leave India and abandon business here. That would probably mean that newer people will come up to take your place. The reason taxes are so high is not because of infrastructure or development. It's a bribe by rich people to everyone else to not murder them. Our country is always one bad day away from collapse. If the rich want to stop paying the bribe the entire country will collapse. Maybe that might be a good thing. It’s a progressive tax system. The richer u are the more u get taxed and a lot of countries follow this what’s new The groups of people who don't vote on the election day will get less favor from govt. -Democracy \>The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy

&#x200B;

The govt does not want individuals to be wealthy, they want more people to be in the 5-20 lakhs (or so) range. They would prefer 5 engineers being employed by WITCH companies earning 8L each at 5 years of experience than 1 being employed by a FAANG earning 40L out of college. (The first will show up much better in employment data than the second) My 2 cents. It's not enough. The government provides way too many subsidies and the tax should be even higher imo. > Patriotism and bullshit like that.

People like you are reason why east India company, mughals and Afghans could easily rule us. In india you can’t become super rich by hard work and honesty. There definitely would have been some wrong doing you either committed or condoned or looked the other way. If it was ancestral it’s mostly the money or natural wealth squeezed out of poor people probably belonging to lower caste or tribals. [deleted] Please do tell me what hard work did you put in to ""earn"" that money Just wanted to ask you few things

1. Is 42.7% your effective tax rate or just marginal tax rate of the top bracket?

2. What's your reaction to the taxes on all types of investment (mainly stock market) profits?
I recently read that US doesn't tax long term capital gain of even foreign nationals. Will that make you reconsider investing in Indian market? I mean if I was that rich I would be sad too but what can you do, it's not like you guys are in a position to bring about a change right? With almost all of the citizens for such a reform. The only option is to Emigrate or pay up There's a great passage at the end of The White Tiger where the narrator talks about the cost of having to pay off the police chief to cover up a traffic accident. It's a lot of money. But paying that money is a rich person's problem. Dealing with the accident is a poor person's problem.

At the end of the day, you have the money to be taxed. You are not starving. To suggest that taxation removes the incentive to be rich is ridiculous. [deleted] If you own a business which serves Indian customers, for example a restaurant or clothing brand or any fmcg brand, the tax is justified because your wealth is earned because of the rest of the population. In India, businessmen have advantage of a lot of customers which increases their profit. Now if such a businessman takes their business to another country, it won't work because nowhere else you will find as many customers, plus differences in market needs.

Yes you can move your company to low tax countries like Singapore like some ecommerce companies have done, but that's a loophole govt needs to close.

Compared to a businessman, a working professional can move anywhere because their skill is in demand everywhere, be it white or blue collar job.

Now about tax utilization, that I agree with. If the government will spend tax to fund new businesses, or help scaling existing businesses, that would help more in increasing jobs and tax base.

[Rant] Criminalization of CSR is another pain for companies,62,cmndkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cmndkk/rant_criminalization_of_csr_is_another_pain_for/,29,"This is another sort of rant about a bad policy by the government. Id first like to clear something up. I’m NOT against mandatory  CSR. I personally don’t like the very idea of mandatory CSR but since it’s law, our company fully complies with all CSR requirements. It’s just the way the government is amending it to make non compliance a criminal offense that is problematic. Let me explain: 

When a corporation is profitable, it pays corporate tax. On top of that, it generates jobs and wealth for individuals and provides valuable goods and services. This boosts the economy. When companies do CSR, they are essentially doing social service and there is nothing wrong in that. 

The problem is why the bloody hell does the government want to criminalize it? I know that non compliance is an issue but this just makes it an additional headache for companies. The compliance officer may not have the same view of CSR as companies do and will eventually end up harassing us. Since there is no concrete framework for CSR i.e. what is and what isn’t CSR, it is largely open to interpretation. And if the government puts another bureaucrat they’ll have absolutely no idea on CSR. 

In fact, I don’t even understand why the government is doing this. The last time I checked, CSR compliance is at 91.25%. There are certain policies (such as the tax on the super rich) which is vote bank politics but this effectively starts an ‘inspector raj’ all over again. 

And if companies have left over money for CSR, we have to deposit in an escrow account after 3 years?! We are not criminals. We WILL eventually use that money. The government is literally putting its hand in our pockets! This is a sad state of affairs. We aspire to be a 5 trillion dollar economy. The government wants ‘animal spirit’. And the ease of doing business here is being dragged down.",billionaireinindia," I always feel CSR is unethical. Companies are paying tax and that is their social responsibilty and that is it. Now another 2% and than making it compulsory is just wrong. It like tax not paid to government over the tax paid directly to govt. Btw i am happy that you own a 500cr turnover company. [removed] This govt is making a big F mess of our economy... Also note that the government often leans on companies to provide funding for statues and other nonsense. I would just put a blanket provision in place saying all CSR funds go towards local government schools proportioned by number of employees of that company in a given location. To be fair, the 'criminalisation' you refer to has always been there ever since it was introduced. CSR's non-compliance has always had (one of the) penalty as imprisonment. They haven't really changed the penal provisions with the amendment, just the enforcement strictness. From all practical perspective, (till now) non-compliance usually leads to compounding (basically a fine) and very very rarely leads to imprisonment (at least I'm not aware of any). I think from an enforcement perspective, they want to tighten things and make sure the companies are not just 'clicking pictures' and doing the CSR but are actually doing the work (or getting it done).

But you're right, the compliance officer might not be on the same page with respect to the CSR activities which can be troublesome to explain and (to show that he's doing his job and being strict n all), it may lead to unnecessary procedures and countless explanations. But then again, that's the thing with any compliance that is done in India. You are correct. Companies should just be nationalized so that 100% of the work goes towards the community instead of the tiny % that goes towards CSR. All the points you stated about employment, wealth creation in the community, etc. will still be true and nobody will have to deal with such regulatory burdens. The finance minister is from JNU....................... Hello fellow 500 cr company stakeholder! Forcing companies to do CSR is good. The existence of the companies is net negative interms of benefit to society. If companies do CSR they interact direcly with society and understand some of the negative aspects of their existence and behavior.",Policy/Economy,2019-08-06 15:12:42

Sorry for the rant",sum1spcl," Well you sound like you desperately need a vacation to get your head sorted. Try to take 2 weeks off before quitting to come up with atleast a small plan to see what you want to do? That’s the only suggestion that I can give. So, I'll tell you how it all works out. 
I am no MBA neither am I some IIT. But I quit my decent paying job, moved back home first and eventually phased out of my job.

I just get about 10k coz in my free time I help dad manage some shit.

I was actively working on starting something of my own been about 40 months and nothing has yet worked out. I read a lot but that too has fizzled out coz now I am bored of books or frustrated in general and now I am more focused to getting back to earning.

I want to travel but that hasn't worked great 10k a month is insufficient for the entire month. 
So I went for a trek to Utharakhand. I paid 4500 in flight tickets to Delhi, train was about 900 I guess and 3500 for the trip. Stay was with friends and food was taken care. So saved there.

I planned a Hampi trip, it's supposed to be a cheap vacation from the place I live. But then j have other important expenses, like my health Insurance. I didn't have it until last year and then I got admitted into a hospital for 3 days and ended up paying more than a lakh.

My mom's root canal cost me 12k, You'll have to ensure your teeth are proper. Those buggers are a money sink.

You getting the idea?

Assuming you living in your home town. Now let's see you'll have friends and they'll surely want you to chill with them, they will be earning - once in a while you will have to go out with them, obviously don't want to end up alone coz you pinch money. One outing will set you back about 2k if you drink in my city. 

These are expenses and lifestyle you don't imagine and I considered it easy.

Do not. You have expenses, you have bills. You need a good passive income to sail you through. 
Again it'll be a call you'll have to take, lifestyle same rakhna hai ya scale down karna hai. 

For a similar lifestyle - I need about 15k a month to survive. But this is no savings. This is bills, travel and basic comfort.

Oh ya, your parents are getting old, so those expenses are something you need to keep in mind too. Even if they have saved some for themselves, as an Indian I am assuming, you'll be there and take responsibility.

What's the trade you need to make and how far can you go with a discipline? > DAE want to not work in a soul sucking job and just chill out and do things you enjoy?

That's what 90% of humanity dreams of bro Don't quit without a plan.

The least you can do is calculate how far your savings will last you, should you quit. After that, make a detailed plan on how to stretch your savings. Finally, as someone else commented, try picking up some freelance work on the internet or IRL to set up a network/fallback. If you can't find freelance work, it probably means you'll have to live solely on your savings...

Oh, and be absolutely sure that you can land a job again after a sabbatical - most industries choose to hire young 'uns because they are cheap and abundant. So, pretty soon you might find yourself too old or too expensive or both. You may not want to go back to a job but if things don't go right, you might just need to, so make sure that avenue remains open.

Source: Currently on a sabbatical. This is how I did it. I did it out of the blue in 2006. I just wanted to do my own thing. Had no idea what to do. Job is not something you are supposed to enjoy. That's why you get paid for doing it. If it was something you enjoyed, you would be paying to do it. You do your job from Monday to Friday, make money & then use that money to pursue your hobbies (read/write/travel) during weekends, holidays and vacations. 

There is a lot of stuff between like & hate. So try to get a job you don't hate (you don't necessarily need to love it) & use the money to pursue your hobbies. You should generate some passive income, start an online business. Selling products on Amazon. If you can do an investment of 50k and buy products from Suppliers, like Alibaba, etc, you might generate a passive income. You can do a research on that topic. Options are unlimited you just have to find them. Travelling takes toll on one's body also it isn't as galmours or enjoyable as people make it seems. A man without a plan won't survive much would not recommend. I was in your place a few years ago. A little older, lesser LPA, more in bank. Headed north and stayed with a friend, planned to head further north to volunteer. Friend convinced me that was not what I wanted, plus had an epiphany over more rounds of beers than usual. Dropped the plan, got back in the grind, realized it is not time to give up just yet.

If the anecdote avove doesn't help, get and read the book Vagabonding by Rolf Potts. While I would've loved a life on the road, that life without purpose would have bored the fuck out of me in months, in not years. God, things would have been different, worlds apart even, but I'm happy and content now. To be frank, almost everyone hates their job and want to leave it and instead travel and enjoy their life, but only a few are able to do so due to various factors. 

I agree with the top comment. First take two weeks leave and then plan how you want to do it. 

For the money part, how much have you saved till now? Do you have any loans? Better invest your savings in 1)Gilt funds and 2) Overnight funds to get better returns than FD and Savings account respectively. As most people have suggested, take a shorter break and figure out what you’d like to do. Quitting before figuring out may backfire and you might end up in a worse place. 

What if you don’t like traveling after a few months? What if you don’t like psychology a few months after you start your education ? I’d suggest taking time off and volunteering/ shadowing or working part time in a field you like and testing the waters before making the leap. 

Also it might just be that you need to switch jobs in your industry and choose something more laid back, rather make a drastic change. Remember the grass always seems greener on the other side. Just take smaller steps to figure out things. Good luck. Tinnitus can make You feel like You have mental Health Problems.
But there's a cure for that.
When your tinnitus is gone, you will be thinking more clearly.
As you have already mentioned, your state is not the one to make a decision this big.
I would suggest you to just go on a medical leave for some time. Travel. Get best medical care for your tinnitus.
Once its cured and you have clarity, only then think about resigning. Do it. Leave the job. Listen to your heart. In my opinion, maybe you should take a break, like go hiking or enjoy a vacation and so on. Leave those works or making money stuff behind.",Policy/Economy,2019-07-14 14:51:29
Did I do the right thing (for myself) by rejecting an offer from a company? Or have I been a dick?,14,cnxe9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cnxe9o/did_i_do_the_right_thing_for_myself_by_rejecting/,8,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I have been out of work for the last three months and after a long time I recently got an offer after the usual push/pull formalities of the hiring process. 

My take home salary in my previous company was 1.2 lacs PM with the CTC being 14 lacs annually. What this company offered me was 10 lacs annualy with the gross coming out to be 80k per month. Before the process started, the consultant told me upfront that the company's budget was 10 lacs annually and at the most they would be able to stretch that to 11.5 lacs annually. 

Since I had been out of work for quite some time, I decided to take the plunge anyway and take the pay cut. After having cleared all the rounds, I was sent the offer letter with the salary break up etc a day before the joining the company. 

Now as I went through the clauses, I noticed two clauses that made me a bit hesitant. 

1. That I would have to return them the joining bonus of 50K if I leave the company before one year. I was to receive the joining bonus after having served 3 months in the company. 

2. That the notice period in the company was 60 days (2 months). 

I couldn't agree with these and I called the HR for clarification. Now this was a day BEFORE I was to join the company and around 7PM. 

1. The HR clarified that if I leave within the first 3 months I wouldn't have to pay it. Now who leaves a company after joining a company within three months?

2. The HR said that this is company policy and there was nothing the he/she could do about it. 

With two other interviews lined up, I decided to not join the company. Though I have a 50/50 chance of getting through the other companies, I however decided it was too risky to join this company. Esp. the two month notice period. 

So /r/india, did I do the right thing? Or did I take too much of a chance. It's been in my head for the last week so just thought I would share it, let it out, and hear your thoughts on this one. 

What would you have done? Should I have just taken the job since I was 'at least' going to get a salary and some money? Also, the consultant calling calling me back, hearing things like I shouldn't have rejected the offer in this economy was too much to hear.",rejectedanoffer," Both the clauses are standard clauses. I don't know what fly-by-night firm you were working for earlier that did not have a notice period and where your in-hand salary is more than your CTC.

&#x200B;

> The HR clarified that if I leave within the first 3 months I wouldn't have to pay it. Now who leaves a company after joining a company within three months? 

&#x200B;

Because those 3 months are most probably your probation period. You can leave or the company can ask you to leave during this, usually with a 15 day notice period. Again, a standard clause. ""My take home salary in previous company was 1.2 lacs PM with CTC being 14 lacs annually""

With tax saving skills like that, you don't need a job bro. Just consult people and make crores every year!!

Anyway, on a serious note the policies were fine. The joining bonus is mostly standard practice since they expect you to at least stay for a year. 

And notice period is also pretty normal since you'd need to finish your projects and hand over work and knowledge transfer. If you complete these before 2 months, you can just go to office and warm the seats (and get paid for it). The company itself will let you go early in that case. You did what you had to. Stop thinking about it and move on. Ideally you should have said yes to them and asked for a joining date couple of weeks away so you could get through the other interviews. If you get through the other interview tell this company you found a better offer and wont be joining. Some people would not like it but there is nothing wrong with it. It is pure negotiation and keeping a backup is a a good idea. Trust me companies will not keep you for even a day extra when they don’t need you. Op you did right thing",Policy/Economy,2019-08-09 12:36:53

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

Satyamev Jayate.",toughbrain," 1. Are you anywhere else other than facebook?
2. Don't you think Humanism is a highly misunderstood word and it might only drive people away if getting people to you is your idea?
3. I see you have a highly ambitious vision (though vague here) is really appreciable. I will take a peek into it. Aaaah, the walls of text just got 10 feet higher. Damn, that took a while to settle in! I really like the fact that someone in India is actually trying to setup grass roots for humanity development and management.

A few tips from my side:

1) It'd be really awesome if you had a subreddit, cuz Facebook can become really Obnoxious, what with all the meme pages, and all the hundreds of friends that people can have. Atleast with a subreddit, Moderation is much more strict, there's pinned posting allowed, and well, there's a lot more control in general.

2) Are there plans to set up a fort location, i:e One location/constituency, that you'd prefer to start with, and focus on first? Cuz I think if you'd start with one, you might slowly reach state-level, which is more than enough to get the nation's attention. I like your long term approach. Anything is possible with tenacity and will power. Good luck to you. The trouble with your plan is that it will strike the vast majority of Indians as being culturally inauthentic. The idea as presented simply is not Indian. It is just an artificial and weird mish-mash of a lot of things that seem to look good at this stage in history (2019), but it doesn't have deep roots in the soul and soil of the land.

BJP is successful because they have a vision for India that (as per their narrative) is as ancient as our earliest recollections of India itself. This vision is made of songs and stories and Gods and saints that are deeply embedded in a lot of Indians' consciousness and their understanding of who we are. They can cite ancient scriptures as sources of the values they advocate. Their imagery and rhetoric have deep roots in the nation's history. Take the icon of mother India or Bharat Mata. Some say that this idea is just a copy of the corresponding European ideas, but every Hindu sees Bharat Mata as just another instance of Shakti, the mother goddess, which is an idea that has deep roots in the Hindu psyche nourished by a vast fund of religious literature and practices.

>	Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition

What RSS achieved over 50 years is only possible if you believe strongly in one ideology. Religion and their rules are a tool to make people cooperate on a large scale, without which they will not. 

I feel it's impossible to create organized movements in that kind of way anymore, unless you use a strong ideology to unite people. But if you do that, it will create blind faith and extremism and that will be counter your original purpose. Moreover, it will counter act against one of the most important qualities that people need in India - Individualism. 

Look at the best countries across the world, they don't have any popular organized groups throughout the country. The Vegan community is the closest comparision I can think of in those countries and even vegans are famous for being intolerant, adhering to their strictly enforced guidelines within the community. As soon as you place the identitiy of a community or a group above an individual, it will lead to the same result. The devloped countries and their institutions are succesful because the majority doesnt beleive in any single ideology strongly, all of them value individual thoughts so it becomes impossible to compromise everything, all at once. 

Therefore, I don't think you should try to replicate their success. But I also don't know a solution to how it can be possible to impart these important values without making under a banner. I really like this idea, and to be honest I was thinking of something like this myself. I'd really like to join, or at the very least contribute to discussions and present ideas and solutions.
 In addition, somebody mentioned here that the ideology might not appeal to Indians the same way that hindutva does and I believe their statement holds a lot of truth. AAP is an example, so it should be a priority to figure out how to strongly appeal to the masses. 

Overall, I want to thank you for being the change you want to see and for actually doing something lol. Please make a sub, not everyone of us are in FB. Police Reforms are the key to unlock the India's potential, How else do you think we can bring fear in the minds of criminals in India? If this takes off, it'd be great!  
I look forward to casting my vote for the IhP one day!

&#x200B;

My only concern is, I don't think your message and philosophy will resonate with the same electorate that voted 'Hindutva Eva Jayate' into power. What's your views on North south cultural divide, LGBT rights? And I'd like to repeat a question someone else had raised is there any place you'd begin, a movement starts only if you begin and progress continually. Indians: Neva! > But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. 



This statement is similar to that of Holocaust deniers. Caste system and discrimination are sins of ancestors, you can't say Muslim are responsible, or reservation cemented caste identities.


I would like to see study or source which says caste identities were less fixed before implementation of reservation in 1947. I repeat, your statement is similar to telling Jewish people that Nazis were not responsible for Holocaust. You can't whitewash thousand year history.






> This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.


Mandal politics came as reply to kamandal politics. Dalits voted Lalu yadav because ranveer Sena did yadav/dalit massacres. Check the links between murli manohar Joshi and ranveer Sena.



Poverty in backward castes was reduced from 1991. Incidentally that was the time when caste based identity politics started. Your claims that identity politics has hurt dalits won't be accepted by even forward castes.










> Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world.

250 million dalits are richer than ST and Muslims. Check facts.

> We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. 

Lol. I can't even. 

> When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. 


It's not about education, it's about ""equal opportunity"". You stop discrimination and it's enough for dalit progress.

> This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system.

How can you give justice to 70% SC,ST,OBC when there is zero judge in supreme Court from these castes? What about 90% supreme Court judges being brahmins?



> We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community 

Are you quoting Sumitra mahajan and her chocolate and kids comment about dalits?

> on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.


But there is persuasive evidence for that. 

> Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.







Your assumption that SC,ST wont vote for you if you said anything against reservation is absurd. You have freedom of expression which dalits respect. BJP is against reservation. In Bengal and Karnataka there are 24% dalits per state. Whole BJP victory in WB, Karnataka, Orissa was possible because of dalits. More dalits voted for NDA than UPA.



You should have taken advice from some social science professor before writing this. It'd be really helpful if you added in links in your post. 

Also, kudos to taking the effort to trying to make a change. Atleast, you haven't given up like me ✌️ How naive to assume that the social, economic, and political inequality is not due to caste and just by providing jobs every issue will be solved. This is the problem of this sort of liberal, we all are equal, agenda, it presumes that opportunities are equally available for all. Whereas it overlook the fact that how Dalits and Adivasis are still discriminated and killed for even attaining some kind of social mobility. props to people who read the entire thing👏

It would be nice to add a tl;dr in the end tho🤠 You will certainly have support from Enlightened youth who are of small proportion.But Its gonna take decades for good amount of common people to support and follow your party, Like you mentioned it's gonna take a long time. But I hope you progress swiftly. Humanist? Yeh kaun jaat hai? What is your take on illegal immigration from Bangladesh ? Maybe a TL;DR at the beginning to give readers a vague idea about what's followed. What's your take on Christian missionaries and Islamic extremism? Our philosophy is to leave the existing reservation system untouched - you lost me on that one. 

If the reservation systen has not changed anything in 70 years, why should it stay on?

Why should we have a system where merit is not the primary criteria and group after ethnic group agitates to name themselves as backward - Jats and Marathas? Not calling yourself an atheist organisation is fine and dandy because we know how scary that word is to the uneducated, but trying to exclude ""secular"" doesnt make sense. Most of the policies your organisation supposedly stands for I can get behind, so I still want to see where this goes. Good luck. If you mean Hindutva as a religion, then definitely yes. But Hindutva as our culture/race can't be removed from us. Because that is what we are. Everyone can practice any religion or adopt a newer one, but the race is not a matter of choice. BJP is totally losing it by mixing Hindutva as a religion and Hindutva/Bharatiya as a race. If you are against affirmative action and reservation then that is terrible. Shows that you have put zero thought into your policies and are just rambling. This is not going anywhere. Atrocities against dalits are increasing and your solution is to take away the one helpful ladder they have? Won't lie, I am from right wing but I'll defect if you abolish reservation. You have my vote. Are you have an AMA . Fat Chance. You will not come to power even in 1000 years as your ideas needs people with good reasoning skills - asking questions was never encouraged in India. Yawn ! 😪 I consider myself humanist. I see few fundamental issues which I figured through lot of introspection. These seem straightforward but no one follows these:

i) Do not give freedom of speech to a group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of speech

ii) Do not give freedom of religion to group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of religion

iii) Do not give property rights to group/person who campaigns to abolish property rights 

iv) Do not give human rights to persons who work against human rights.

and so on.

Criticism welcome. This naturally eliminates commies, jihadis, anti fos activists, criminals etc. and yet is 'humanist' in nature.

Logic is systems should have survival instincts else they die, however noble they may be. It this gonna be a face for new BJP .",Policy/Economy,2019-05-27 19:36:02

I see that there is an existing master thread on the Budget. I should have ideally posted this summary there. What is PIS and FPI? \> A TV channel for startups (to be designed by startups)

Let's hope it's just not another startup news channel, 'X startup secured Y funding' is useless for 99.9% of startups.

Where as UGC type startup channel which covers knowledge rather than information i.e. 'How to identify a problem, to solve with a startup', 'How to make money with a startup', 'How to improve capital efficiency' etc. would actually be useful. What's the tax slab for hybrid vehicles going to be? Still the retarded 28+cess?

Also if this is a provision in the budget and not a rate set by the GST council, is it constitutional? If it is, then wouldn't it then become a statutory provision that the GST council cannot amend? Who will prevail? Thanku for this.",Policy/Economy,2019-07-05 17:21:58
Talk to you guys about my life in china,5,c629ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c629ts/talk_to_you_guys_about_my_life_in_china/,13,"Five years ago, I was a Indian college student and I didn’t know anything about my own future.
 Just as I am about to graduate, I get an opportunity to study in China, and China’s policy for foreign students is tuition-free, and there are 20,000 scholarships each year.
 At this time, my brother told to me: ""China is also a developing country. The level of consumption is also very low. Our uncle is doing medical equipment business in Yiwu, China. You can also try it.""
 When I was confused, I followed my brother's advice and set off to study in China.

 Learning Chinese is not difficult at all, and oral Chinese is much easier. I was studying in Hangzhou, so I have visited around Zhejiang. 
 When I visited my uncle, I learned about the company him worked with, called Sunny world medical. I search it in google. I was very envious of my uncle, I wondered that I will become a millionaire just like my uncle after graduation. 
Now that India’s economy is improving day by day, people’s demand of medical care is even greater.
 So I took the opportunity to contact the medical device company named Sunny world medical in China.  I borrowed money from my uncle and contacted sunny world medical to place an order.
 This simple operation made me earn more than 20,000 CNY, nearly four times of the profit!

 At this time, I met a Vietnamese girl named ""Mary "". Her Chinese is better than me. I really like to study with her in the library.  Just then, a Pakistani man appeared.  After he came, Mary started  pay less attention to me day by day.
 I took this opportunity to express my confession, but she sent a text message saying that I am a loser, a social failure! This is really irritating!
 I am a South Indian, only 5 feet 5 inches tall. The Pakistani guy is 6 feet 4 feet tall.
 Mary must have dismissed my short. However, as a man, it is useless to be tall. What is important is how high his ambition is!
 So I worked hard and made another 60,000CNY in the previous method, and then I was only 22 years old!

 Thanks to the lack of the Indian market's large demand for the medical device industry, thanks to the sincerely Sunny world medical. Now, I am holding the tall Chinese girlfriend ,Sofia, I am no longer feel sorry about my own sense of failure. Because a man doesn’t depend on how tall he is, but how tall his wallet is.
 But sometimes ,especially at the midnight,i still miss Mary. What does she do? Does she happy? It not because how much i love her, but i love the most marvelous moment of myself.",healthcliffs-reddit," Saving this post locally just for the copypastas lmao XD Quora is that you? Your English towards the end is atrocious, was it a consequence of learning Chinese ?

>Now, I am holding the tall Chinese girlfriend ,Sofia,....But sometimes ,especially at the midnight,i still miss Mary.

Why specifically midnight? Does Sophia turn into a vampire or something?

>Because a man doesn’t depend on how tall he is, but how tall his wallet is. 

Wallet hila ke so jaa Mary had a little lamb You lost me after, ""Learning Chinese is not difficult at all""... How do I purchase 1,00,000 shares of Sunny world medical?! Stop upvoting stupid content

UNION BUDGET 2019:-

Summary:  Low impact on personal finance as such.  There are some good noises on NBFC, startup, etc.  More help given to small businesses in GST.  Gold duty hiked to 12.5%.

Edit: Custom duty hike in many electronic items. This can affect your purchase decisions.  Mi phones may become cheaper than OnePlus :-)

-	In 2014, Modi govt allowed mid-sized polluting industries to operate within five km of eco-sensitive areas like national parks and sanctuaries. Earlier this limit was 10 km. (https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/nda-government-further-eases-environment-clearances-for-projects-45664)

This NBWL cleared most of the 140 projects till August 25, the Supreme Court questioned the Centre’s move, ruling that “any decision taken by it (NBWL) shall not be given effect to till further orders” (https://qz.com/255772/the-11-environmental-disasters-narendra-modi-blessed-in-his-first-100-days/)

-	This NBWL approved 99.82% of all industrial projects, giving environmental clearance. Under UPA, 80% of projects got clearance (https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9982-projects-in-forests-got-nod/article26261368.ece)

-	Modi govt tried to destroy NGT, our environmental watchdog. They misused the provision of a ""money bill” to make changes to the appointment system of judges to the NGT. So NGT loses it’s independence and becomes a puppet of Govt.

Feel free to add something or update some point here.",dhruvrathee," > In Goa, they classified Coconut Tree as a grass ...

Excuse me Goa, what the f*ck! That's a very good comprehensive list.

It's unbelievable how the bjp is literally selling our country's future away for momentary short-term gain.

 This is excellent work.  What's the solution? From the people on the ground to the policymakers at the top no one wants to do the right thing.

Farmers grow the most water-intensive crops like sugarcane even in the most acute drought and then end up going into debt and committing suicide.

Politicians and government officials at every level pilfer money meant for irrigation projects and then suggest that they can piss in our dams if the farmers want.

Nobody from common home owners to municipal corporations wants to seriously consider simple steps like water conservation, rainwater harvesting and wastewater recycling.

The solutions are obvious and plenty. But our mindset is such that they'll never be adopted.

Is the Gandhi Family suppressing the Left-Wing of India? (I am a Foreigner),12,bu2q23,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bu2q23/is_the_gandhi_family_suppressing_the_leftwing_of/,12,"Recently, I have wondered whether the Gandhi family has truly hindered many progressive policies in order to uphold the Status Quo. 

We have seen this with Manmohan Singh, in which during UPA 2, Sonia Gandhi indirectly took more control over the party and we saw the downfall of many sectors of Government. Another instance of this is how the Gandhi Family disrespected Narasimha Rao, India's most progressive leader. A man who was able to liberalize the Indian economy and initiate many reforms within the Government. The Gandhi Family did not even allow Rao to have his funeral in Delhi and moved him back to Hyderabad.

Even as we witness AAP, which seems to be a Congress Party without the Gandhi family, it seems to be much more progressive and eager to change than Congress.

So as a non-Indian, I am curious, do you believe the Gandhi family is suppressing the Left of India, as it silences more progressive reforms and legislation, in favor of status quo?",Brainiac7777777," [removed] It has nothing to do with left. It's all about keeping the history books praising nothing but Gandhis. The same happened with Rao. He tried so hard to present the the reforms as a continuity to Rajiv's government. The case was far from truth. Rajiv had no idea of exonomics & his profligacy pushed us into the 1991 crisis. But still Rao turned that around. He was accused of being BJP's B-team in th babri masjid case while the fact is that he was cheated by the BJP guys who didnt keep their promise. It has nothinf to do with left. The Gandhi family doesnt want non-Gandhis to shine in the Indian history. Rajiv was worst PM ever & still people talk about Rajiv with respect. That is what Congress has done. I dont think the downfall of the left has anything to do with congress. The congress party is having a family crisis right now. It’s fascinating/scary to see the drama unfold as we speak. Indians love drama btw. 
As a young Indian, I’m quite happy with the results.",Policy/Economy,2019-05-29 01:18:50

Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

What happened to BSNL?,90,b2flpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b2flpy/what_happened_to_bsnl/,33,"I think BSNL was sabotaged internally for the profit of private companies.

* BSNL used to be a very good provider of telecom services in the country. I remember it was the first telecom company that came into our small town, it provided very good service for that time, it was relatively cheap and reliable. It was also the first 3g provider in our area.
* But somehow, quality of its services went downhill over the years,nowadays the network goes down in my area very frequently due to some fiber optic cut, or sometimes something gets stolen from the tower premises and nobody seems to care.
* Everybody in my town had at least one BSNL sim which they used, but after the disruptions everyone got frustrated and switched to other providers.
* At the time of 3g allotment, BSNL was forced to take the spectrum in all circles by matching highest bid price in that circle. I don't understand why couldn't the govt give the spectrum for free in the first place. After all it's a govt entity, and everybody must have known it would kill BSNL.
* The government didn't even allocate 4g spectrum to BSNL, it was like the final nail in the coffin.

Edit!

* Many of you are looking at BSNL as a separate non government for profit entity, which i don't, I see it as publicly owned utility which is an absolute must for our modern times, not just for remote or non profitable areas but for every location in the country.
* BSNL wasn't as bad as some may believe, it was definitely not up to the mark like Airtel, but it wasn't as bad for that time, we never had network outage of any kind, and was cheap too. It went from average to worse in the last decade only.
* The argument that free spectrum for BSNL may seem unfair for private companies, i would have accepted that if we had a truly free market economy, we never had one, free market in our country only exists for a very few oligarchs, it is used by the govt at its whim.
* I will give you an example, take the case of India Post, it's a PSU and a very well functioning PSU, should we have charged some license fee for it to operate? We have a perfectly good model how shipping and courier companies work in India, they work just fine alongside IndiaPost. Unlike the IndiaPost's case, telecom spectrum is a limited resource so we need a barrier for the entry, but private companies should have survived that too by limiting the amount of services BSNL can provide.
* Also, BSNL wasn't in any sort of bad shape before the 3g spectrum drama, it wasn't in debt, it had huge reserves, to the tunes of 35000 crore which the govt forcibly took from it as a licence fee. All the policies regarding 3g spectrum allocation wreaked havoc on the telecom industry, BSNL drowned in debt not because of being a PSU but because of incompetent governments and its policies like most other private telecom companies.
* BSNL management didn't live in a vacuum, they perfectly knew 4g was coming and they were not slow or incompetent they were sabotaged internally to act like this.
* It's not just Modi, both the BJP and Congress are complicit

While i was never a fan of BSNL's services and the way it tried to compete with private players, I believe it is extremely important to tier 2/3/lower towns and villages as the sole connectivity provider. Also BSNL in losses is not a bad thing as long as it is reaching places which are not economically viable for private players. 

I think a lot of fucked up foresight and planning has led us to a place where BSNL needs way too much money to keep afloat, something that every govt is short of. 

 I still use BSNL. 

yes. Even in the days where Jio is like the king of data, I still like to use BSNL. Not because it charges high, or something like that. But to help it survive. And I feel it is the sole connectivity provider in remote areas and some of the northern frontiers even today. At remote areas like Munsyari, Dharchula, Pithoragarh, Tanakpur (Uttarakhand), BSNL still reigns over Jio. Got full network in these areas and even on mountainous terrains and roads.

&#x200B;

Red-tapism killed such an amazing organization.  It's going the same route as AI. All profitable sectors are auctioned to the highest bidder/cronies and state owned providers are stuck with non profitable sectors. BSNL still has one of the widest coverage, in areas nobody else could operate profitably. This comes at a high cost but the value provided is also high, not in monetary terms but in connectivity to remote areas.  From now on, when someone says Private Companies, they mean one/many of {reliance of big bro, reliance of small bro, adani, or some gujarati fraud company}  also, they were sabotaged by staff unions to avoid disinvestment. only profit-making companies shall be IPO'ed .  They won't let it die and they won't let it live. Doesnt matter what you see it as. It is a for profit entity listed on exchanges and must follow the law as any entity. Giving preference to BSNL would be unfair to other private companies. It would discourage foreign investments in all sectors if this is the attitude displayed by the govt. Worse even existing foreign players would drag India to dispute in WTO.

Not just that, this type of behavior is detrimental for the transfer of knowledge and job creation. I remember the days when BSNL was so damn expensive. Glad we opened up to private sector and now the calls and data both are dirt cheap. Third, also a big PSU like BSNL is a hotpot for corruption. Private companies do the job just as efficiently and fairly. Yes, they have no incentive to expand to remote areas, but this is also industry that changes very rapidly from 2G, 3G, to 4G to now 5G. There needs to be a constant stream of investments, infrastructure upgradations, and network managment - All of which is probably not efficiently possible for a PSU.

Also private players succeed well because they have better boards, leadership teams, promoters with deep pockets playing the long game. They are faster to change and more adaptive to changing customer behaviors.

Your argument that BSNL is an utility and it makes sense to keep it running, and yes I do agree with that. However, this should be done by infusing more money by govt, not by twisting rules to work in its favor. But, where is the govt gonna get the money from? Also, India is a developing country and there is much better ROI by using that money for infrastructure / job growth rather than subsidizing a bloated / inefficient PSU.  Bsnl will make a comeback, I think so.  Red tapesim, favouring privatisation, crippling BSNL etc etc... They've been played real bad, a lot of forced delays to help competitors.

Thank you for stating this!    

A psu does things in interest of the public to serve the public. A private enterprise does a public service/move to serve its own interest. Privatization is also not a guarantee of great services.     
I just hope consumers keep in mind that even if they like private service, it wont fight for them unless it affects their bottom line. Support the greater good cause and support your fav private convenience provider as well.     

As always - bsnl lao desh bachao    

 Idk what you're talking about.

Installed BSNL giga fibre in my house last week. It's cheap and amazing. I always have a ping below 20 and both up and down speeds are around 48Mbps(8MBps). Sabotaged by the govt so it gets devalued and some private company buys it for a pittance and voila said private company has massive coverage and raises prices cuz it becomes a monopoly/duopoly. 

India has just 3-4 telecom providers now. Jio, Airtel, Vodafone/idea and bsnl. What happens when there are few competing companies, all 3 collude to jack up prices. 

Look at America’s telecom industry. We are heading there as we speak. AT&T, T mobile and sprint. Prices are exhorbitant and services are crap.  Their customer service is the worst  my 3g network was out for a whole week and they didn't even extended my plan by that time which is lost due to their incompetence. Their employees doesn't care about customers cause they get their salary either way at least that's the situation here. Call 1503 wait for 2 hrs to talk to a customer service agent what a joke. But there is also a positive side about bsnl they were the only provider who was online during the flood. ",Policy/Economy,2019-03-18 15:15:29
"'The Husband, The Wife and The Wife Deserter': A Tale Of Triple Talaq.",2,c3okk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c3okk1/the_husband_the_wife_and_the_wife_deserter_a_tale/,2,"As the Triple Talaq Bill is on the verge of becoming an actual law, let's take a look at what triple talaq is, what it is not and what really is at the heart of the whole debate. 

Triple Talaq is something that Islam itself traditionally frowns upon. Scholars have warned against it since time immemorial and it's generally strongly disliked. Its sole purpose was to serve as a remedy for the *really* troubled marriages and some historians believe that it was originally granted by the Prophet as a means for the 'women' who were married to the most despicable men so that they'd escape that relationship as soon as possible. But, as often tends to happen with most well-intentioned laws, people managed to find the loopholes and favored the 'letter' of the law over the 'spirit' of the law. And as such, most Muslims would be absolutely okay with the illegalization or nullification of triple talaq, but more on that towards the end.

Speaking of laws and women, Islam is the first religion in history to have given women 'rights': social rights, ownership rights, inheritance rights, marriage rights, the right to initiate divorce, the right to remarry, the right to be a witness and give testimony in matters requiring the same, the right to do business (the Prophet's first wife, Khadijah, was a wealthy merchant herself), the right to fight in battle and many many more. Fourteen HUNDRED years ago. 

But, over time, some Muslims twisted the teachings of Islam to suit their own purpose, misused and downright *violated* the very laws of Islam protecting the sanctity of women's rights.. And, over time, it also became okay for the rest of the world to somehow always find a way to judge the 'entirety' of the Muslim community and religion based on the examples set by these worst of Muslims, who are completely unrepresentative of both Islam and most Muslims. 

Anyway, before I digress, coming back to divorce.. So, more than 1400 years ago, Muslim women were granted the right to initiate divorce through the legal sharia process referred to as *'khula'*. (This when women around the world were either burned at the stake for wanting rights or had to promise to be married to the same man for seven lives or had to throw themselves into the pyre with him when he died.)

This is what the normal, the more 'preferred' mode of talaq (divorce) looks like: It's supposed to be done in three stages, over a period equaling roughly three months, and only after the grounds for it have been firmly established (infidelity, adultery, betrayal, loss of affection, etc). Even this 'normal' form of divorce is only meant to be the 'last resort' when nothing seems to have worked to save the marriage. The first month, provided the grounds for divorce are not major (infidelity and/or adultery) and if there is the slightest hope for reconciliation, both the spouses are encouraged to find common ground and rethink their stance, the second month, once again, is time for reflection and possible reconciliation, and only at the end of the third month, when *all* attempts at reconciliation have clearly failed, is the divorce deemed to be finalized and can the spouses part ways.

Anyway, THAT is the 'normal' approach of going about divorce in Islam. And surprise surprise, THAT is how most Muslims actually go about getting a divorce. Most Muslims, too, generally hate the idea of triple talaq. Remember, it's *supposed* to be an absolute last-resort measure, *if that*. Here's a report based on a survey which found that of all the divorce cases amongst Muslims, a mere '0.3' percent were identified as those performed through triple talaq. Less than 1 percent. 

https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/unimportance-of-triple-talaq-supreme-court-muslim-law-4678304/

Yes, 0.3 percent. THAT is how low the incidence of triple talaq really is. Let me just say it once again so it really sinks in. ZERO POINT THREE percent. 

But, how many of you knew that? Or rather, how many of you were led to believe that 'most' of the divorces among Muslims happen the triple talaq way? Or that it's so prevalent among Muslims that 'millions' of Muslim women are simply abandoned by their husbands within seconds? Or that it's because Islam itself encourages it? Or that it's because women simply have no rights in Islam to begin with? 

Many, if not everyone. 

That brings us now to the second, the hidden yet the more important part of this discussion: the 'politics, propaganda and Islamophobia' aspect of it. 

If you could time-travel to today's India from ten years before, odds are you'd find it barely recognizable. 2019 was supposed to be the year when we were just a year away from the watershed moment we dreamed of that would forever change our nation's destiny. We were going to be a developed, happy, prosperous nation, the vision of APJ Abdul Kalam come to life. 

But, it's safe to say that that dream is much farther from being a reality *today* than it was ten years ago. And however unrealistic or unattainable that dream may have been to begin with, I am sure nobody in their wildest dreams ever imagined an India where a 'terrorist' would be elected to the parliament and become a 'lawmaker' in 2019.

A deeply radicalized, bigoted and easily manipulated religious majority has set the country back by many many years, if not decades. Such is the level of toxic propaganda and such is the intolerance of the truth that nothing and absolutely nothing seems to have the potential to stem the flow of this madness anytime soon. 

And it is in this backdrop that it became possible for a man who abandoned his mother, abandoned his wife decades ago and presided over riots that saw hundreds of women get brutally killed and thousands get raped, to rise to be the 'messiah' for Muslim women and their rights and for everyone else to buy into this whole charade. 

And this allowed everyone to believe that the 'logical' solution to correct the injustice of triple talaq was to 'jail' the man for three years based on a report filed by almost anyone, keep the woman on a measly welfare fund for the same duration, keep her children far away from their father and, thus, eventually, to 'save' the marriage. 

If you still think that the triple talaq bill, in its present manifestation, is anything other than a deeply hateful, vengeful exercise of power through which to punish Muslims for, well, *being* Muslims, you clearly are on the wrong side of history.

"Zombie State Owned Enterprises, Vampiric Corporations, and a Fossil Fuel That Refuses to Die: Why India's Reliance on Coal is Bad For India and the World",23,bv3p2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bv3p2i/zombie_state_owned_enterprises_vampiric/,1," 

Coal in the United States is a dying industry. Coal mines in West Virginia and Wyoming have long been [closing](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2018-10-13/large-west-virginia-coal-mine-with-400-workers-closing) their doors, and total coal consumption in 2018 is close to half of what it [was ](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37692)a decade ago. It is likely the coal power plants will struggle to survive without [subsidies](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/06/donald-trump-hopes-to-save-americas-failing-coal-fired-power-plants). However, it would be a mistake to assume that coal is a dying industry. Many large countries, including India, Indonesia, and China are rapidly increasing their use of coal. In today's podcast episode, I will be exploring India's coal industry, focusing on the struggles of Coal India, the public sector enterprise that dominates coal mining, to dig up enough coal to meet India's demand, the inability of coal and other extractive industries to bring development to the regions where they are most active, and the implications of India's increasing use of coal on the global environment.

Coal India Limited, a state controlled mining company that [controls ](https://www.coalindia.in/DesktopModules/DocumentList/documents/Annual_Report_&_Accounts_2014-15_Deluxe_version_In_English_03102015.pdf)82% of the coal market, has dominated coal mining in India since its creation in 1971. Coal India has struggled to meet the demands of India's rapidly growing economy because it is expected to provide coal to power plants at costs well below global market levels. Coal India was forced to sell coal at prices 70% below market [averages](https://www.ft.com/content/9233696a-8323-11e1-9f9a-00144feab49a), reducing Coal India profits by half. Similarly, Coal India has long [subsidized ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/indian-railways-and-coal/)passengers on Indian Railways by paying above market rates to transport coal. Coal India is legally obligated to hire all of those its mines displace, and strong unions command wages that consume [half ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/coal-india-high-wage-bills-cast-a-shadow-on-coal-majors-numbers/articleshow/13617713.cms?from=mdr)it revenues. Moreover, corruption and mismanagement at the highest level have resulted in windfall gains to connected companies of [$33 billion](https://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html) . A violent and powerful coal mafia has [emerged ](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-coal-jharkhand-dhanbad-coalindia/special-report-coal-mafia-stokes-indias-power-crisis-idINDEE94D00B20130514)that skims money off of each stage of coal production and distribution, with ""Goon taxes"" rising as [high ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208)as 10%. The combination of these factors means that Coal India does not have nearly enough money to invest in mechanization and new technologies. Labor productivity of Indian miners is only 4% of that of those in the US, and only 1 in 10 mines are [mechanized](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/what-s-keeping-india-dark). The result are severe shortages in coal that act as a serious break on rapid [development](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/indian-govt-grapples-to-find-causes-of-coal-shortages-2018-11-26).

A problem just as severe as Coal India's inability to produce enough coal for the Indian economy, is the fact that coal and other extractive industries have failed to bring prosperity and development to the regions in which they are concentrated. A vastly disproportionate share of India's coal reserves are located in the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These states are the home of around 8% of India's population, but [over ](http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy%20Statistics%202019-finall.pdf)two thirds of India's coal reserves. India's iron ore, bauxite, and copper reserves are all disproportionately located in these [states](http://www.jsmdc.in/web/AvailabilityofMineralsinJharkhand.php). However, these three states are also among the poorest in India, with rates of GDP per capita, and human development metrics such as infant mortality substantially worse than the [national average](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States&fromdate=03%2F02%2F2019&todate=03%2F04%2F2019). Moreover, despite wealth of natural resources, these states have seen substantially lower rates of growth than the national average. These disparities are especially striking that many mines are located in adivasi or indegenous lands. The adivasi populations of the region are consistently at the bottom of these impoverished societies, and see few of the benefits of mining. It has been estimated that mining led development has displaced [lakhs ](http://indr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/B.-Terminski-Mining-Induced-Displacement-and-Resettlement.pdf)of people. In theory, Coal India is obligated to provide employment to these displaced people, but has only managed to provide jobs for a small [minority](https://books.google.com/books?id=BxDKhOnWwOsC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=tribe++employment+%22coal+india%22&source=bl&ots=mKvZZWjGxn&sig=ACfU3U2jNdOszeIC3kEvO_E3Ft7pU3xKtA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwii5fKs-YPiAhUDMawKHcwOC-Y4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=tribe%20%20employment%20%22coal%20india%22&f=false), while pollution has impacted the livelihoods of many who . Many adivasi people have turned to the Naxalites, a radical and [violent ](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Maoists-trigger-train-crash-100-die/articleshow/5985997.cms)Maoist terrorist group, out of desperation and many ordinary people have been [caught ](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/bastar-tribals-raise-their-voices-against-naxal-atrocities-118032900569_1.html)in the [crossfire](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/chhattisgarh-activists-up-against-salwa-judum-atrocities-107090601020_1.html). While Naxilte rebellion has lost power over the last 8 years, the underlying roots of the conflict have not been addressed.

India's coal industry has consequences that extend well outside of India. India is forced to rely upon coal imports as Coal India has failed to met [demand](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-expects-india-coal-imports-to-hit-record-1557467616076.html) in India. India imported $25 billion of coal in [2018](https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=1%7c%7c%7c%7c%7c2701%7c%7c%7c4%7c1%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1), and is projected to become the largest imported of coal in the world in 2019.helping keep mines in West Virginia and Australia open. More important is the Indian coal industry on global climate change. While India is still taking [part ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news)in the Paris Accords, it has made promises of only modest cuts because coal is so central to its development strategy. To be clear, India is investing massively in solar and wind power. Total installed capacity of wind power has more than [quadrupled ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country)over the last decade in India, and 5.4% of India's electricity comes from solar power, a proportion more than [double ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country)that of the United States. Nevertheless, coal is likely to be king for the foreseeable future. Millions of Indians are [buying ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-in-indias-passenger-vehicle-market)their first cars every year, while India produces vast quantities of carbon [intensive ](https://www.devalt.org/newsletter/jan97/of_1.htm)products such as cement and steel. Most importantly, coal consumption is rising rapidly in India. The International Energy Agency projects coal use in India will [increase ](https://www.carbonbrief.org/iea-china-and-india-to-fuel-further-rise-in-global-coal-demand-in-2018)from 563 to 708 million metric tons, with total coal consumption increasing by more than 3% a year. Over the last decade India has grown only more dependent on coal, as the percent of electricity generated from coal increased [from ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.COAL.ZS?locations=IN)66% to 75% between 2007 and 2015. India [emitted ](https://www.axios.com/china-india-us-pushed-carbon-emissions-to-record-levels-in-2018-1b1e171a-d46a-49b7-bc4a-7250942a1a7d.html)2.6 billion of the worlds total 15.3 billion . While per capita carbon emissions are well below the global average, carbon emissions are increasing at a rate over 6% a year. Reconciling India's need for development and environmental concerns will be vital for fighting global warming.

India's coal industry is highly inefficient, a poor engine for raising standards of living, and dangerous to the planet. Nevertheless, the coal industry remains vital to the future of India's economy. Coal fueled the industrial revolution in 18th century England, the rise of America in the 19th century, and the spectacular growth of China in the 20th. Coal is likely to similarly, for better of for worse, likely to play the same role in the development of the Indian economy in the 21st century.

As per [**news reports** ](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/trai-to-meet-telcos-officials-to-discuss-issues-for-deliberation-in-2019-118112701007_1.html)India’s telecom regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) likes to do it as well. It has started a process for setting its priorities for 2019 and is meeting telecom companies. We believe that such planning is good, and it can be better if they heard from internet users as well.

Yesterday, to put this request across formally we wrote [**a letter to the TRAI**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ftvbwFjL1K5ALB5M723Wv6JJuIWWNmFE/view?usp=sharing). We are asking them to invite a greater diversity of views beyond telecom companies in private meetings. This must include internet users. We are seeking to crowdsource complaints, wishes and requests and substantiating them with our policy expertise and taking them to the TRAI.

**Tell us what issues bother you?**

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:**  (1) We have sent a reminder to TRAI today again asking them for a meeting. We are going to keep following this up. (2) We are creating an excel sheet to collate responses across Reddit, Twitter and Email. (3) While we have tried to reply to each comment, we have limited staff and are now spending time to look at how we can link your issues to actionable policy based submissions.   


Finally, thank you. The Reddit community has shown us much love through participation and engagement. We appreciate that deeply, thank you! We promise to keep engaging and bridging the gap between the public and public policy. ",InternetFreedomIn," 1. **Simplify recharge plans**

My ideal interaction with provider would be to throw annual payment their way and forget they exist for a year.

I'd really like simple pay-and-forget-for-a-long-time plans. Mainly to receive calls and occasionally make them.

Data is totally *unimportant* to me. I'm ready to pay for such an annual subscription, but they come up with all these complicated recharge plans where there are all kinds of voice+data tradeoffs, and weird validity restrictions. They are complicating decision making for no benefit to me. It's even more complicated for people like my parents who are unable to remember things like these. It's like aadhar all over again.

Simply put, I'd like them to offer simple idiotproof plans for idiots like me and my family. Take our money, and give us voice calls and SMSes for a year.

&#x200B;

2. **Handling 2G/3G retirement**

Recently, in August, I had a very bad experience with my provider.

I got an SMS out of the blue from provider on a Sunday afternoon - a day when their own customer offices are closed - that I *have* to get my SIM changed from a 2G to 4G compatible one by next morning 9AM.

The next morning they just shut off my service, just like that!

I had to disrupt my work plans to facilitate *their* stupid administrative work, surrender my aadhar details to them to get their new SIM, faced problems with fingerprint biometrics (4 fingers didn't match, luckily my middle finger did. Yes, they asked for my middle finger and I gave them my middle finger, literally and figuratively), and then, worst of all, they took 48 hours to activate SMSes or calls on that new SIM - apparently, that's some kind of security feature to prevent phishing.

My mobile is my emergency as well as business device. 2 days offline as their official planned migration procedure with little advance warnings was not a good feeling, and was very customer hostile.

&#x200B;

Now there's news that they plan to forcefully retire 2G and 3G altogether in the next year or so, and allow only 4G capable mobiles. I have no doubt they'll botch up that too.

I'd like TRAI to review their decisions about this forceful retirement. If it's absolutely necessary, then I'd like TRAI to make provider come up with a properly planned procedure with minimum disruption and advance warning to customers . 1 hour I can understand, but 2 days forced offline is ridiculous.

&#x200B;

Edit: 1 more point

**3. Emergency addressal of service issues**

Thanks to the government's own policies which require mobile service for everything from OTPs for aadhar to banking, a mobile cannot be treated like any another service. Things like mobile number phishing or service stoppage can result in grave personal / financial consequences to a user. It can't be left to customers to coordinate between private company customer service and police, who all follow their own adhoc timelines. It requires some kind of neutral ombudsman who can address issues in emergencies and have jurisdiction to direct actions at the telco operator level if required. Any compensation issues can be addressed later, just like it happens in healthcare emergencies.

&#x200B; A month = 28 days? BSNL is doing random ad injection and page redirection. I have noscript browser extension installed on firefox. From time to time sites I visit get content from BSNL IP addresses. Multiple posts have been made on r/india about complaining to local bsnl offices, but I guess these kind of decisions to redirect traffic are made way up the mgmt food chain that local frontline BSNL managers cant do anything about.

If BSNL is allowed to do it, whats preventing Reliance Jio from redirecting any commercial request to their businesses? Unnecessary spam in form of ads, calls, messages as well as emails by jio. I recharge my plan I know what plan I'm taking I don't need 3 calls, 5 messages and even more emails to tell me what it is for. Plus the imminent spam of everything that begins just a week prior to expiry of the plan. I'm bombarded with calls, sms, emails and worst of all, the myjio app inserting full page banner ads everywhere in the system as they please, telling me to recharge. I block a number and I get call from another number, but never again from same one(I've set to notify if blocked number calls), this is even more fishy, how do you know I blocked your number? And biggest of all, how many numbers do you have to just spam your customers? This needs to be regulated strictly as well. 1. A plan should not be called unlimited if there is FUP
2. Do away with 28-day plans. Plans less than 30 days should be allowed to exist only if a similar 30-day option is given. 28 days = 13 billing cycles per year and we're not stupid. 
3. Content Blocking: Ideally there should be no content blocking. But if there has to be, then TRAI or the DoT should maintain a public database of hosts/ips/URLs that are blocked. 
4. Pay-and forget unlimited plans - take my money and make yourself scarce. There should be simple annual unlimited voice, SMS, and data plans where one can just pay annually and not think about it again. 
5. Regulate logging by ISPs
6. DNS over TLS service must be provided as an option to all subscribers.
7. Fast track escalation/resolution of DND violation complaints. Stricter action against telemarketers who violate people's DND preferences.  With respect to Broadband. Trai in **2006** had set *guidelines*for internet speeds. The ISP had to guarantee **80%** of the speed till the last node.

This was back in copper wire dial up days.

Now with fiber optics, the tolerance could be reduced. Say 95% of the speed guaranteed.

Also traffic shaping should be stopped or made public before buying a connection.

Fair usage policy should be done away with, unlimited plans should be truly unlimited. Given now there's Fiber to home connection, we are no longer *taking away others network* which was the original argument for FUP. Corporations who buy bulk phone numbers to sell stuff... Please regulate that.

&#x200B;

While buying something from a store where they ask for my phone number, I would really prefer my phone number not being sold to any other company.

I end up receiving calls from companies trying to sell me properties in my city, insurance, and all other crap.

PLEASE MAKE MORE STRICT RULES FOR CORPORATIONS TO COLLECT MOBILE NUMBER. What we really do need is more information from our ISPs. A lot of ISPs ,especially in smaller towns, throttle internet speeds at varying times in the day to save their own costs, go below the plan that they have given out and people generally don't complain because they've sort of grown up knowing ""Internet band ho gaya""

I don't have a solution. Perhaps better auditing of ISPs in smaller towns would help this. We don't have fiber or good internet and the local ISPs can basically take full advantage of that 30,61,92,185,366 days plans.  

No requirement of having to recharge the number compulsorily. 

Plans for only voice.

Plans for only data. And volte. 

Stop using SMS for ads.  I don't think anyone reads them. It's just nuisance. Easy options to review and report violations of DND. And punishments for those sub selling their databases for SMS dumps. 

 Blocking torrent websites. I don't understand the point of blocking a p2p network. Its not all for piracy.  PORN BAN Stop with 28 days(and multiples 56 days, 84 days so on) recharge plans. How hard is it for these telecom operators to provide a month long (30 days) recharge plan instead of milking one extra month of recharge from customers. Airtel blocked incoming calls to my phone after my plan expired. I understand outgoing but incoming!! .I've been a loyal customer to Airtel for the past 6 years and I've paid them who knows how much money and yet they do this douchebaggery! Pathetic. Also they want to charge us a minimum amount per month to keep using their sim? That's absurd! The 'unlimited validity' issue tops it all for me.  Airtel reduced validity of my pack. If they are gonna introduce some changes to the validity-system, then it should be done after the current pack expires. They forcefully reduced the validity (which I think is not legal?) and asked to recharge with 23 rs or smart packs to get 28 days validity.

Also there are no long term validity plans. Its simply annoying to do 23rs every month. My suggestion would be to not ban the internet of the whole city just for a fucking government exam, did I mention the government exam is a very low level. Its almost impossible to reach the customer care in Airtel. There is a long message indicating how much balance I have left and my validity that takes 2 minutes of the call.

Once that is done, i have options to avail advanced talktime, check previous payments, pay previous advance talktime dues, stop autocredit of talk time but there is nothing that will help me know why my incoming calls are banned even after the minimum recharge.

Also, I got notified of the minimum recharge thing only 12 hours before the expiry. There was no notification on either MyAirtel app or SMS before that. 1. Not every month is February. Away with 28 days.

2. Minimum recharge loot. It's unbelievable that we have to keep paying every month to keep the phone numbers that we have had for years or decades with God knows how much money spend on them. 
Do note that Vodafone customer care explicitly state that their hands are tied and they are only doing this because of TRAI's explicit orders(you can test this, ask them why this change). Which is bullshit, because companies put forward this to TRAI. Anyway falsefied information. 

Not to mention that the companies actually gain revenue from incoming calls in form of termination charges. But nah! They just wanna loot the customers. 


3. Stop banning stuffs. It's simply against the freedom. 

4. Take actions so as to not let telecom sector become a monopoly.

5. Make it so that the companies are forced to provide an option to talk directly to a representative rather than going through tonnes of menus on their customer care.

6. Ads and spam calls, DND doesn't really work as I still get bombarded with shitty smses and calls. Get this right.
 I have several concerns. 

1) Why is so much content blocked? I can't even visit sport sites like Bleacher Report.


2) Like so many people have already said, a billing cycle should be of 30/31 days.


3) No FUPs on unlimited plans.


4) Basic speed of Broadband should be higher. Why are we still stuck with 512 KBps? 


5) QoS control. Like an acceptable rate of speed for most of the time in a day.


6) Interference of Govt. with Internet services. 


7) Stopping shady practices by Vodafone etc. In unlimited 
plans, if at the end of day I have a significant amount of data left, my speeds are throttled to the point that I can't even open a webpage. And then magically, I have my speeds restored after the data for that day lapses. One month should be of 30 days and not 28 days.
u/InternetFreedomIn Never allow contracts for mobile plans! People in countries such as Australia suffer so much by this! Like getting in 12 months contract and if they want to change plan then you have to pay all the remaining months.  Even after spending good amount for their plans, I don't get promised speeds. Not even close to promised speeds. Even worse I get only 2G signal while the network's official website says ""this area has 4G VOLTE coverage"". So I want a fool-proof ""system"" to keep this in check. (May be download an app from TRAI which tests the speed or signal coverage and automatically reports it). Some things I would like to be heard - 

1. DND is not very effective. Even after reporting a DND, the errant marketer will say it is a service call and the complaint is closed. No one digs deeper. It is painfully obvious that this is just for eyewash.
2. Data speed - The actual speeds we get do not really match up to 4G and lag behind. Sometimes there is no data. We need some quality control here.
3. Tariffs - Telecos don't tell you when they have a new plan with a lower subscription price for your current subscription. They do not declare it on the website also and if it is it comes with fine print (an oxymoron since it is not mentioned at all). I hate the minimum recharge shit these cartels are bringing. It must be our choice tp recharge how much we want whenever. Get this rescinded. A number by TRAI to block a specific annoying sms sender eg TM-MyGov or TM-anycompanyname. Let's say I want to block sms alert from TM-flipkart completely then I will send ""STOP TM-flipkart"" to some TRAI number ;)

Cheap plans only for validity just like Bsnl no need to care about expiry :) I don't use data at all (50 rs recharge in my Jio Phone which also goes waste and normal SIM in my android ) 

Jio customer service (I don't know if it's right to complain here) but they are ill trained like so so bad. I can send you email screenshot anytime :) Issue is they are very very bad at resolving an issue, their reply on email will be about how great their service is and how helpful their app is (dude I checked your app and faq and then I bothered to mail else I would have called if it's little issue) Their call service Guy takes very long to get on point ;_; and no matter how detail mail I write, someone who can't comprehend it will receive it and will never bother to forward request to the one who actually understand issue and guess what if your issue don't get resolved on same day, they don't create a ticket and you need to follow up with New person again -_- I really hate them when they copy paste stuff and rarely get on point. Cutting internet access at times of protests (Like how it happened in case of Tuticorin sterlite ban) doesn't do justice to democracy and safety. Cutting internet for the sake of government entrance exams is also preposterous. TRAI should stand against these practices. I am sure much better alternate methods can be devised. One vexing issue that I wanted to highlight is the continued and forced separation of VoIP and PSTN traffic. Call routing is not allowed between these two worlds and it is stifling Indian development in unified voice communication services. Case in point, Indian is one of the few countries where you cannot buy Office 365 Dial-in conferencing - because once a VoIP packet originates anywhere in the world, it cannot terminate on a mobile or terrestrial voice network in India, by law. 

The technology and applications (with associated billing and security measures) are available today - but we are stuck between gigantic oligarchs whose attention is anywhere but evolving newer competitive voice communication models. That is why we are home to a unique service industry around enabling 'logical partitioning' - which is nothing but feature suppression on modern PBXes that are designed to break down traditional VoIP / PSTN barriers.  Allow IP telephony from across all platforms. Give preference to people of India against corporate companies when it comes to TRAI policies and benefits..  I know it's already been said and trai has called them out for it, but I want to chime and say that forcing a recharge for availing services is thuggery and the evil trifecta ( Airtel Vodafone and idea ) need to be stopped from looting. I can understand that they are going through dips in profit but to charge an existing user a monthly fee of sorts just for having the number exist is preposterous. Why do they need to charge us for incoming calls when they already charge the network provider of whoever is calling ? Jio is blocking most of the websites. Their customer care execs told me that this is done based on government order. Interestingly, even government websites are inaccessible. How come there is such a grey area or a lack transparency? Straightforward way to report credit card scammers! u/lokqq already mentioned this about this about BSNL. But I would like to inform something about MTNL.  
MTNL injects advertisements through ip on non-https pages also just like BSNL. Their own official site mtnlmumbai.in is non-https. Their broadband service is so horrible that I have to call them every month (sometimes every week) because their broadband connection keeps resetting itself because their wires keep getting moisture (literally what the repairman said). MTNL keeps advertising about FTTH a lot where I live, but when it comes to providing it, its non-existent.(MTNL telephone exchange center is less than 1km from where I live btw.)  

now that I am done with MTNL's broadband service, here are the issues with their ""3G prepaid"".    
I have a prepaid data plan of Rs.421 , to activate this plan, first I need to spend Rs.421 for plan and then need to spend Rs.20 for balance. If I don't have minimum balance, the Rs.421 plan doesn't activate despite the payment going through, so why do I need to spend more money? other providers like Jio don't have this kind of requirement.  
The plan includes unlimited free calls, but for some reason If I call toll-free numbers of Banks (SBI/ICICI etc.), the money is cut off from balance. And as I said before, if there is no minimum balance in account, the data plan I paid Rs.421 for deactivates till I spend more money to recharge the balance.  
Sometimes when I call with MTNL, I get echo of my own voice, this also happened when I called their service center.   
Just like their broadband service, their data service also keeps disconnecting despite having full network.  
I have passed these complaints to MTNL service center by call, but haven't got any followup call or solution.

&#x200B;

They are sent without a number, so we are not able to filter/block them as there is no number to block. Even apps like Truecaller are not able to block them. Cross ownership of media. TRAI came up with a Consultation paper, LCI did a panel discussion and then it fizzled out. 

Needed now more than ever.  Telecom companies often subscribe us to paid services that we don't need and we didn't opt for. That should be regulated. Yes More efficient 1909 blocking.

Many spam companies keep sending sms and even after reporting it to 1909, they won't stop it. In fact, they increase the spam towards that user.

1909 report says it's service message (i.e. having an account of that company) & **not block-able**, even though I'm not having any account or anything to do with that sender (i.e.  it's fucking SPAMMER).

I reported **more than 500 SPAM SMSs** maybe thousand(s) to 1909. But, hardly they blocked few of the spam.

And, now I don't get many necessary OTPs but get the SPAMs. As they blocked unreported service messages, but not the spams that I reported.

**& I've full DND enabled.** Why the hell nobody is talking about call drops, shitty call qualities and crappy network? Take money and give good network that's it! Please note down this issue and raise it during meetings.

Here is a hidden info what these telecoms do on network complaints. You put a complaint, there will register the complaint and assign someone for the visit from their RF team. The guy will come and note down the signal strength in and outside of your location and will give the feedback to the department who has nothing to do with but just to brush it off with different ways by putting remarks like tried to contact customer but not reachable or the area is best optimise for your location since due to geographical reasons we can't go beyond. You again raise the same concern they will close it with the same reason with more confidence such an assholes.

So in short you will never ever get a resolution for a network complaint. There was a time when complained at higher level to leading telecom, was asked to provide a space for renting a tower during their initiative called open network. It was all bloody sham!

Just remember we are paying them for the services they are offering, if the network is crappy then why are we paying the complete price? Nobody pays full for half! ISP using monopoly and providing slow internet speed (just 4mb/s in 2018) please block spam messages and calls Some thoughts that I have:  

1. TRAI should make seamless wifi handover mandatory(especially for voice/video calls) so that people and companies need not invest in setting up additional 4g/5g(future) radios in areas where people can use any network for data and Voice calls. Basically setup a system to allow telecom providers to piggyback(for the lack of a better term) off existing wireless networks in regions where they dont have network coverage.


2. I should be able to view what company/organization/government body has requested access or has accessed my Identification information such as AADHAAR, Pan, Driver's Licence(any and all unique ID's) with no exception. Should easily be able to identify which ID is linked to what services/accounts, etc throughtout the lifecycle of my existence and beyond.


3. To take it a step further, No company/organization, etc. should be able to access my personally identifiable information without express authentication by the user/owner. Maybe have  a portal/app that receives requests that does not provide the requested information, unless I explicitly allow that particular request for information to be shared.


4. Set up a more robust/fool-proof and secure method of getting a replacement SIM card so that nobody can just go to the telecom provider and get a new SIM card with your number. This will prevent a lot of the scams that rely on getting replacement sim card to bypass 2 factor authentication that is used by banks.
\n>

5. Set minimum broadband speeds to at least 8 Mbps(if not higher) for rural areas. Meaning whether FUP is reached or not, speeds should never be below that threshold.

6. Download and upload speeds for connections should be mentioned clearly in plans. Most ISP's provide <1/10th of plan speeds for upload. So if/when one has to upload a project file or a YouTube video, etc, it ends up taking more than 10x as long since upload speeds is less than 1/10th of download on most ISPs.

Questions for supporters of the current Government in India,60,9xtncw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9xtncw/questions_for_supporters_of_the_current/,67,"I want to ask BJP and Modi supporters some questions.

Did or did not Modi say that all black money is in Swiss Banks? If he did, how much of that black money has come back in 4.5 years?

Did or did not Modi say that high prices of Petrol, Diesel and Gas have a bad effect on economy and that people of Gujarat are suffering because of bad policies and failure of Dr. Manmohan Singh's government? If he did, then how come prices are at an all time high now?

Did or did not Modi say that the falling value of rupee is because of corruption in Delhi? Then how come rupee went to almost 75 to a dollar? Would that also mean that there is still corruption in Delhi?

Did or did not Modi say that MNREGA is a living example of failure of Congress government which is getting ditches dug and filled even after 65 years of independence? If he did, then why did he continue the MNREGA program?

Did or did not Modi say that GST can never be implemented in India? If he did then why did he implement it and that too even on clothes and fabric (which has never been taxed in independent India)?

Did or did not Modi say that FDI will hurt the small retailers and kill the biggest segment that provides jobs? Then why did he allow FDI in retail and 100% FDI in single brand retail?

Did or did not Modi say that he will send Congress leaders and other corrupt people from his own party to jail? If he did, then how many people has he even filed an FIR, forget about sending to jail?

Did or did not Modi say that nobody will use a Bullet Train but we should have it just as a symbol of our technological achievement? If he did then why take a loan of 1,10,000 Crores to build some thing that nobody is going to use anyway?

Did or did not Modi say that he will give One-Rank-One-Pension to retired soldiers? If he did then how come he gave One-Rank-One-Pension-Every-Five-Years to them?

Did or did not Modi say that farmers will get 50% clean profit over and above their costs? Then how come there is budget for procuring just 5% of farmers production at that prices and the farmers are being left at the mercy of private buyers after Government procurement budgets and targets are met?

Did or did not Modi say that if people voted for him then they will be assured 'Good-Days' ahead? If he did, then has anyone seen those 'Good-Days' till now?

There is no reason to elect him or his party again.

On the contrary taking decisions like Demonetization and implementing a faulty GST and now the 59,000 Crore Rafale deal show that his decision making is faulty and damaging for the country.

In the Rafale deal he has committed treason (desh droh) with the country by reducing the number of aircraft from 126 to 36, paying extra price and hurting the PSU HAL at the cost of private entity of Anil Ambani.

It will be India's misfortune if he somehow comes back to power.

So if you are patriotic, throw out the garbage.

You have nothing to fear from anyone, especially the Muslims. In fact they live in mortal fear even though they belong to this country and love it, love it probably more than you do.",waahmudijiwaah," Yesterday I was watching election coverage in MP and Rajasthan. And almost all small businessmen said they used to support BJP but GST and Notebandi has ruined their business. Though BJP bhakts are still high on demonetization claiming it eliminated black money. So asking them questions expecting rational and practical answer is unfair to their intelligence.  You missed the real treason committed by not only Modi but every single BJP MPs sitting in parliament that day. This particular instance was the day I concluded that BJP is worse than even ISIS. These retarded shameless fucks sold out our entire nation, everything we fought for; our independence and sovereignty of India in the future , all ruined by these brainless retards BJP and RSS.

They legalised corruption and foreign interference in Indian politics by letting foreign powers(even foreign government by a shell company and private companies, remember east India company?) fund Indian political parties and elections. They later also made these donations anonymous, so that its never revealed who funded our government. And all this was passed illegally as a money bill along with many other bills sticked together. Check the FCRA amendment and all the other related bills.

This taking foreign funds to change or affect the outcome of our Indian election is the very definition of Treason. There is no bigger treason that you betraying your country by taking money from foreigners to represent them in the PARLIAMENT OF INDIA and betraying the PEOPLE OF INDIA. ANd the traitor party made this legal and anonymous so that no one will know. Are you a teenager? If not, by now you should have realized that Indians accept a baseline level of lies and dishonesty from all governments and all parties. 

It does not matter that these people are liars and dishonest, but at least they are our liars (belong to our tribe, cast, etc). Got it now? Oooo.. logic and everything is being used here. 
Can we get back to important issues like Ayodhya and cow urine.  People who use religion or cast or ethnicity to spread hate are the enemy of the nation. Every Indian who is true to his salt should raise his / her voice against them. >You have nothing to fear from anyone, especially the Muslims. In fact they live in mortal fear even though they belong to this country and love it, love it probably more than you do.

This. Not just Muslims but Christians and other religion as well, not that many religions except for those two. Remember how churches were being attacked too for no reason in 2014. 

Just before Rajasthan polls now, Aaj Tak is claiming there is gonna be a Terrorist attack by muslim groups in rallies of you know who. This is the standard tactic of BJP to polarize the voters just days before Modi's rallies and the voting day. And shamefully mainstream media spreads this without consulting Investigating agencies. This is the shit game they are playing which seems to be working out for them right now. 

But it's a design they have created even before Independence if India, which they have successfully done it with years of creating enough poison and hate.

You wouldn't hear that from any Muslims and Christians in rallies and speeches, they don't make one except for that Owaisi who works for Modi as an scripted enemy. [deleted] They don't take questions. Why is it that governments rarely do anything they say during elections in India? Whether it is NDA or UPA, I have rarely seen them deliver on promises, whereas in the west the governments do deliver. Why doesn't it work in India? [deleted] Your question is too complicated for bhakts who have have the attention span of a goldfish and critical thinking skills of a peahen. 

All they can remember are the catchy slogans.. for eg. ""Mandir vahi banayenge"" or ""go to Pakistan"". Everything else is ""bhains ke aage bhagwat"".  Whom would you vote for instead of just opposing Modi? What are the best ideas of the opposition to vote for if not the personalities? What is their track record? >Did or did not Modi say that all black money is in Swiss Banks? If he did, how much of that black money has come back in 4.5 years?

No data on this yet.

>Did or did not Modi say that high prices of Petrol, Diesel and Gas have a bad effect on economy and that people of Gujarat are suffering because of bad policies and failure of Dr. Manmohan Singh's government? If he did, then how come prices are at an all time high now?

Inflation and a bull run in crude market. Bears are on the horizon so crude will drop soon.

>Did or did not Modi say that the falling value of rupee is because of corruption in Delhi? Then how come rupee went to almost 75 to a dollar? Would that also mean that there is still corruption in Delhi?


Rupee is holding its own pretty well. Its the dollar that's grown strong thanks to Trump. Rupee is performing well against other global currencies. That's the reason other developed and developing economies are willing to deal with India in terms of rupee and exchange currencies, rather than face a strong dollar.

>Did or did not Modi say that MNREGA is a living example of failure of Congress government which is getting ditches dug and filled even after 65 years of independence? If he did, then why did he continue the MNREGA program?

Rural road construction is at an all time high. MNREGA is doing fine here in UP villages, don't know about the rest.

>Did or did not Modi say that GST can never be implemented in India? If he did then why did he implement it and that too even on clothes and fabric (which has never been taxed in independent India)?

Not sure when he said that, election rhetoric maybe? As for GST on textiles, and everything else, doesn't affect me much in my daily life.

>Did or did not Modi say that FDI will hurt the small retailers and kill the biggest segment that provides jobs? Then why did he allow FDI in retail and 100% FDI in single brand retail?

Election rhetoric? FDI is doing well to fill RBI coffers, also I'm pro-FDI. Wanted FDI to come, they brought it in, I'm happy.

>Did or did not Modi say that he will send Congress leaders and other corrupt people from his own party to jail? If he did, then how many people has he even filed an FIR, forget about sending to jail?

National Herald case is almost done. Expecting a positive judgement out of it.

>Did or did not Modi say that nobody will use a Bullet Train but we should have it just as a symbol of our technological achievement? If he did then why take a loan of 1,10,000 Crores to build some thing that nobody is going to use anyway?

That's like asking why invest in bringing PET-CT because nobody is going to use it, why not just make more X-ray machines? Your question is badly framed.

>Did or did not Modi say that he will give One-Rank-One-Pension to retired soldiers? If he did then how come he gave One-Rank-One-Pension-Every-Five-Years to them?

Have a maternal uncle who retired as a Major. He's happy with it, and says its a good decision.

>Did or did not Modi say that farmers will get 50% clean profit over and above their costs? Then how come there is budget for procuring just 5% of farmers production at that prices and the farmers are being left at the mercy of private buyers after Government procurement budgets and targets are met?

MSP has been increased, right? Don't know the details though. Will read and respond. As for farmers, they're pretty happy with subsidised seeds, soil health cards and the addition of Neem to Urea. There used to be gun-fights just a decade back in my native village over Urea cuz corporations would steal it and there was little available for farmers. Now with Neem added, its a boon for farmers.

>Did or did not Modi say that if people voted for him then they will be assured 'Good-Days' ahead? If he did, then has anyone seen those 'Good-Days' till now?

I'm doing good. Roads are great, rare powercuts unlike that month long coal-shortage fiasco of summer 2012, railway Platforms are clean, cheap internet, cheap food, better salaries. Don't know for you, but my life has improved since this Government came.

>There is no reason to elect him or his party again.

Roads, rural electrification, railways, RERA, IBC, salary-hikes, controlled inflation, UDAAN scheme, UJWALA, Ayushmann Bharat, Mission Indradhanush, more medical colleges and hospitals, sanitation, well maintained airports. There's loads of reasons, least of which is the absolute lack of vision in the opposition whose sole focus seems to be defeating him. I'd rather vote for him than a makeshift mess of a coalition that has no goals beyond seizing power.

>On the contrary taking decisions like Demonetization and implementing a faulty GST and now the 59,000 Crore Rafale deal show that his decision making is faulty and damaging for the country.

Demo was a grand failure, yes. As for GST, all my baniya friends are anguished that they now have to pay taxes which were easily evaded previously - I'm happy that I'm not the only one bearing the taxes anymore. Rafale deal is in court, I'd wait for the judgement before making any conclusions in something that is a government secret and rarely anyone knows anything about.

>It will be India's misfortune if he somehow comes back to power

That's your view, and this is a democracy. We are privileged to have our own views. Mine differs from yours. Neither of us are completely correct. That's just how things are.

>So if you are patriotic, throw out the garbage.

No u.

>You have nothing to fear from anyone, especially the Muslims. In fact they live in mortal fear even though they belong to this country and love it, love it probably more than you do.

Never been an issue for me. And stop judging me for my love for the country.

***

If you're trying to change people's views, better not start blaming then right away. Try a discussion rather than outright ""Love it probably more than you do"" crap. You're simply pushing them further towards the right by saying stuff like that.

Peace.

Edit: Yes, bring on the downvotes instead of responding to my views. Good going. My karma is pretty low but it will probably hit rock bottom when I am done.    
    
First, when making so many statements, it is better to provide sources so people can read the article and then give a rebuttal.
   
I feel Modi overpromised and didn't keep up with his promises. I feel he and his party directly or indirectly focused a bit much on religion and not on delivering.    
    
Did his party not achieve everything they said they would? Definitely, if they did they would be the first political party in the world to ever to do it.    
    
Did his party do good things in their run? I would say yes.    
    
Could his party have done more? Obviously yes.    
    
   
> Modi and black money.    
    
He has definitely taken steps to curb black money. The income declaration scheme brought black money into market. The acts of benami transaction act and black money and imposition of tax act also helped curb black money. In a possible shrewd play, Indian government and Swiss banks signed a pact where the banks would reveal names of black money in 2019. Whether it is true or false, how effective it is, that is to be seen but he did take measures.    
    
Just so, I am not called a ""bhakt"" let me say it outright **DEMONETIZATION WAS A FAILURE**. Modi underestimated the jugaad level Indians have and it failed. There were some positives but they are small compared to the main objective of demonetization which was black money.    
    
Source : https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/what-has-pm-modi-done-to-fight-black-money-an-explainer/story/280890.html    
    
    

> Modi and rising rupee prices ( also oil )    
    
Rising rupee hurts Indians yes. But is it Modi's fault?    
In 2009 INR USD was at 48, by 2014 when new party came in power in 2014 it was 60. Until April 2018 dollar was at 66 or so. It was maintained really good, just 8 Rs rise in 4 years is really good.    
    
Now someone will point out it is 72 right and oil has shot up. Yes it has, if you look at historical data, you can see rupee shot up near May and has been climbing? What happened in May 2018?    
    
Trump pulled out of the Iran deal and put sanctions back on Iran. Iran's chief export is oil. We import a LOT of oil so our prices shot up. India imports almost all of it's oil as we have no large oil basins. So as oil costs went up, our expenditure went up to purchase oil which lead to rise in rupee and also oil prices.    
    
Our government could subsidize oil prices like UPA did but the repayment of interests hurts the next government, I believe that the policy ""let us spend to keep our voter base happy and let the next government handle the aftermath and the shitstorm is wrong"" , it is my personal opinion.    
    
You may differ.    
    
As you may have noticed that oil prices have been falling and not touched the all time high of September. Again the global cost of oil fell which led to our costs going down.    
    
Fun fact : To curb India's huge dependence on oil, Modi has stepped up investment in renewable energy sector, India is one of the faster growing market in renewable energy.

>Modi and MNREGA    
   
Modi did criticize it and wanted to scrap it. However there was public outcry against it and congress labelled them as anti poor. It is also an immensely successful program in terms of reaching across India, so Modi kept it but tweaking the nature of the program to make it more productive.    
    
Even Manmohan Singh who launched the program said there are problems in it which have to be addressed.    
   
Modi changed the scheme by allowing direct disbursement to the workers rather than middle man and used the Jan Dhan accounts and Aadhar to curb any leakage of funds or corruption. Economically Modi is right that it creates a drain but it is a very popular scheme so to not anger the population they decided to keep it. He streamlined it and made it more efficient.

So as you can see the government has taken steps to solve the problems you addressed, could it have been better? Of course yes.    
    
    
You can find faults in each and every government and you should. But completely neglecting all the good things they have done and only focus only on negative is a bad thing I would say. Being a supporter or not seems irrelevant. Answer to all questions above is as follows 'This is Politics and there's nothing called clean Politics. Indian Politics has always been Majoritarianism. You have a choice to fight, accept or leave.' Well... Election is about choosing lesser fool isnt it?  Not a BJP supporter but i dont think there are other viable options.",Policy/Economy,2018-11-17 12:49:07

"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman",6,azoh6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azoh6g/suddenly_one_nation_one_policy_sentiment_is/,3,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

[The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/yv-reddy-interview/article26489119.ece)",Avinash_Sharma, I've always liked the forest cover model of assigning tax resources to the States. It's a very esteemable initiative. [deleted] Summary ,Policy/Economy,2019-03-11 11:39:27

"With the recent Oxfam India Inequality report & Congress' Minimum Income Guarantee announcement, why aren't we discussing AOC's 70% marginal tax in India already?",3,alx3kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/alx3kj/with_the_recent_oxfam_india_inequality_report/,4,"[Oxfam Report](https://scroll.in/latest/910224/oxfam-inequality-report-indias-richest-1-grew-by-39-in-2018-bottom-half-by-3)

[Minimum Income Guarantee](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/congress-beats-bjp-to-income-guarantee-plan-but-leaves-math-to-manifesto)

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",sultanatehere," Ohh pls...

GOI will need a separate department of International taxation to tax all the millionaires who accepted foreign citizenships... Idk why you talk of dividend income as if it's untaxed. Dividends are given after tax. Then there is also dividend distribution tax and some cess on it.  We badly need an inheritance tax as well to address the wealth inequalities.",Policy/Economy,2019-02-01 10:13:23
What a huge disappointment this Government is! Let's get to work now.,125,8sorcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8sorcj/what_a_huge_disappointment_this_government_is/,94,"\*\*\* THIS IS IMPORTANT \*\*\*

[Failed Modi Government ](https://i.redd.it/mq42u5cx0a511.jpg)

Man, when modi government came to power I have no hesitation to say that most of us were highly hopeful to achieve greater good, improve our fucking economy and that's it. What else anyone wants?. At the core of our wishes I have a feeling that this is what we wanted i.e. to make India a 'Better India' and a lot of problems can be solved. This government however focused on nothing more than 'Cow Politics', making swami's as cabinet, Chief minister etc. With zero domestic policies and a hugely failing foreign policy. China and our neighbors have vastly bad relations with us now. No other PM has done so many visits to other countries (and as we speak our Sushma Swaraj, President etc. ) are on their international trips as well which so to say our 'honeymoon getaway' nothing else. 

With hatred spreading all over and people getting lynched I see the only hope in 'Arvind Kejriwal' and don't get me wrong I've done my part being a devil's advocate for a long time and I've seen him work greater good than anyone else at the moment. He may be foolish, dumb and sometimes narrow minded but that's exactly the best option we got. However, him and this topic is for another time.

https://i.redd.it/fugc2pu51a511.jpg

We must remember what this government did to us and how we all came together to support modi's policies but little did it help the economy and us. Now suddenly, he wants to give farmers incentives and take my word before general elections BJP will dump billions of rupees to promote their campaign and spread lies and WE WILL forget everything!

IF WE WANT TO MAKE INDIA BETTER, don't forget this and to show your vote, bring the ones up that are doing good, educate your families, make wise decisions because every vote counts and none of these cluster fucks shall be left re-elected. We can do this randians. LET'S GET TO WORK!",irahulkapoor," My entire family which voted for BJP in 2014 is voting Congress this time. Everyone should give this a watch regardless of your political affiliation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inR_O_2Apm0 Main point is people(including me) don't want Rahul Gandhi type alternative. If Chandrababu Naidu runs for PM, I'll vote, otherwise I'm left to think Modi will win 2019 very easily without any worthy challenge.

No online outrage can hurt his chances if the real life opposition is dumb af. I warned guys like you that it will happen. Modi or not, bjp will always be under RSS walaas. Everytime bjp comes to power it loses at end, because of religious politics. And it waits for next generation to cheat . Won't work. 1/3 of India votes through their emotions, the other 1/3 votes to whoever lines their pockets, and the last 1/3 votes through coercion!

Arvind Kejriwal does not have the recall that Modi has. You want to make a change? Get someone who can capture the imagination of the nation, like Modi did in 2014. Who else is there like him currently? No one. The ruling party will win 2019. Simple. So people here are prepared to vote for somebody whom they actually rooted out back in 2014 just because they hate the current in power.

This is an Alien vs Predator like situation as someone from this sub quoted earlier. We gotta rise above this and start utilising our vote power much intelligently and effectively. > With zero domestic policies and a hugely failing foreign policy. China and our neighbors have vastly bad relations with us now. No other PM has done so many visits to other countries (and as we speak our Sushma Swaraj, President etc. ) are on their international trips as well which so to say our 'honeymoon getaway' nothing else. 



I am sorry you start losing my interest when you make blanket statements like ""Zero domestic policies"" and ""hugely failing foreign policy"".

Especially when it's factually wrong GST (regardless of whether you liked the way it's implemented) is still a major domestic policy/reform(and there are several more like IBC, UDHAY scheme, etc..).

As for the major opposition I don't see  Kejiri being successful nationally(if recent polls are any indication) and I absolutely despite the current major opposition which is basically a coalition of some of the worst leaders in India like Mayawati, Rahul Gandhi and Mamta (I would say CBN and KCR(if he is part of the opposition) are the exceptions).

I would take Modi and the current government anyday over dipshit like Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati. 

I will not vote for the congress unless Lal Bahadur Shastri or PVN Rao come back from the grave.

 This govt has delivered good GDP growth during its tenure, it even hit 8% in 2015 while UPA2 had a low of 5.5% growth in 2012. And forecast for FY 2018-19 is above 7% too. So Indian economy is not as bad as opposition projects. World bank data https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=IN And IMF http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/IND

But on social front, things have deteriorated. Though law and order is state govts' responsibility, the people who lynch in the name of cow have been emboldened, mostly due to central govt not condemning such incidents. Amit Malviya and his 'gang' are too powerful unfortunately.BJP is 100% winning in 2019 IMO. Congress is a bloody thief. That was clear by the end of UPA II. What no one knew was that to defeat the thieves, we are hiring dacoits.  [deleted] I am going to vote for BJP they are good for share market. I am very heavily invested in the market and I need BJP there for 2019 too. FUCK congress as they are very socialistic and communist in their policies. If BJP comes to power in 2019 then nifty might move towards the 15k mark.  I don't care about religious tensions as they are there from the beginning of India. We are all racists, in the end, no matter what you do there is always something. Call me a bigot or bhakt but this is the harsh reality. It doesn't really make a difference who is in power. India doesn't work because it is full of Indians.",Policy/Economy,2018-06-21 11:51:49

This is what's gonna happen when you pair poor computer literacy, lazy programmers, old cyber infrastructure , fake pateriotism and lack of will for security of public.  We need a wikipedia page for AAdhaar leaks . There are so many of them .  [removed] Thanks a lot man. I have such links just in case I need to slap something my friends with and I don't have it. Having so many of them on a topic at one place is a lot of help. 

Someone should make a list of all fuck ups of modi.  God damn. fuck.   How can I help? I am an experienced web developer.

Perhaps an interactive site or forum or both. People might like to explore this too: r/antiaadhar had to scroll 5 times to get bottom of this! That's a lot of work.
Thnx brah Thanks, this is much needed. Aadhar is being misused by the govt in big way. Does anyone maintain a google drive to store all news articles related to adhaar? Saved Wow ! Top quality content OP! this should be stickied Holy fuck!! [removed] cool Articles can be deleted from websites, no?

We should save it as PDFs! Yes thank you man. This is just what I was thinking about that if someone ever asks for proof about shittyness of Aadhar, this is it. Even the UIDAI would shut their mouths. You the real nigga! 🤘🏻 Nice u/-0-1-

Support parliamentary scrutiny against internet shutdowns #KeepUsOnline,34,a0gvsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a0gvsw/support_parliamentary_scrutiny_against_internet/,2,"**Internet shutdowns are a growing national menace**

The internet continues to be shut down in different parts of India with increasing frequency. As stated in a[ recent op-ed authored](https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/there-is-no-evidence-that-internet-shutdowns-work/story-4aERxaY1OMNTG8siM0iMMM.html) by Apar Gupta, Executive Director and Raman Chima, Trustee and Co-founder of IFF, published in the[ Hindustan Times,](https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/there-is-no-evidence-that-internet-shutdowns-work/story-4aERxaY1OMNTG8siM0iMMM.html) ""*The answer has been evasion as the central government till date has refused to provide any count or centralise a reporting and disclosure system. We should not fear such data, and that such calculation may put us to shame, for even*[ *existing news reports*](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2018/india) *, India enjoys the top rank as the global leader in the number of Internet shutdowns.*"" 

This is a matter of national shame. We are losing on our rights and India's continued potential to lead the knowledge and skills economy which relies on reliable internet access. We have now started reaching out to parliamentarians on this issue. 

This continues our working model of activism where our public engagement is toward institutional outcomes. A short recap. We have through the #KeepUsOnline campaign reached out to 15,000 individual and 80 institutional signatories who petitioned the government to condemn internet shutdowns. We then followed it up with a series of RTI's which demonstrate the legal rules for shutdowns were made secretly, and most recently supported a legal analysis of these rules by one of the domain experts in the area, Nakul Nayak. 

We will continue working against internet shutdowns, meeting people, talking to them about them and ensuring India has a better rank in 2019. Do follow our updates.

**So, what is IFF doing about it?**

Next stop is parliament and we are looking towards our legislators. The dates for the winter session have been announced which commences from December 11. We sensed there was a need to reach out to the offices of various legislators in advance. As subject area experts we are attempting to set up time, talk to their offices and explain this issue to them. Our hope through such knowledge sharing and to enable greater parliamentary engagement on Internet Shutdowns in India. To enable this, two volunteers (Arpitha and Hardik) authored a brief of this issue which is now being sent across along with meetings to put this issue across to several parliamentarians.

**How can you help?**

* **Call on your lawmakers:** We urge each person to reach out to their member of parliament and discuss this issue. Their details are readily available on the [Lok Sabha](http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Members/AlphabeticalList.aspx) and [Rajya Sabha](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/memberlist.aspx) websites.

And after all of that you'll have to deal with dumb costumer who can't even fill a form properly.

The customer is not dumb - forms are complicated for no good reason that even educated person like me, who does sciency mathy techy stuff everyday for work, gets confused. You people should hire communication and documentation specialists - who understand human communication and India's demographics - to simplify the wording and reduce confusion of your forms, use local languages, and deploy vocal instruction kiosks that'll guide people without having to ask. As a customer, it's no fun to interact with any bank or government or nationalized organization's employee and nobody does it happily or voluntarily.

**ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS-JOY FOR INC, WAKE-UP CALL FOR BJP**

**Can the Congress upset the odds in 2019?**

The biggest question everybody had before today’s results was can the Congress fight back against Modi and BJP, especially with 2019 around the corner. While their performance in Telangana and Mizoram was disappointing, it will take heart from its wins in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. 

For a party which was in disarray until a year and half ago with no clear sense of direction from the party high command, the Congress has slowly staggered back onto its feet to fight the Modi and Shah duo. With a seemingly reinvigorated Rahul Gandhi at the helm, they have taken the fight to the BJP in Modi’s own bastion-Gujarat, cobbled together an alliance in Karnataka and now snatched Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh back from the BJP. 

While the party is trying hard to capitalise on the anger of the masses against the Central government’s policies and decisions, the Congress still has a lot of work to do on the ground level if it seriously wants to come back to power in 2019. While the results might show Congress winning in three states, there is a very distinct and real possibility that voters were fed up with their state BJP governments due to anti-incumbency and they are still going to vote for Modi to become the PM again in 2019.The Congress’s performance in Rajasthan is also considered to be relatively disappointing with chaotic seat distribution, infighting and rebel Congress leaders costing the party another 15 odd seats.

**What next for the BJP?**

While the results aren’t going to make BJP workers too happy, the BJP still remains in pole position to come back to power in 2019. With the so called ‘Third Front’ still nowhere near fruition and the Congress’s efforts to pitch RaGa against NaMo not exactly gathering steam with other opposition parties means that Modi continues to be the most popular political leader in India currently. The extradition of Christian Michel related to the Agusta Westland scam and the recent court order allowing the extradition of Vijay Mallya from the UK also serve as a timely boost to the BJP’s anti-corruption rhetoric, which was on a slippery slope after the Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi sagas. The BJP has also made no effort to hide its Hindutva agenda, starting with the renaming of Allahabad to Prayagraj and Faizabad to Ayodhya. BJP led state governments in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh also cleared the way for the building of gigantic statues of Lord Shiva and Rama respectively and this Hindutva pitch will only get more brazen in the lead-up to 2019.

While the BJP might be smug about its chances in 2019, it has to keep an eye on the grumbling middle class and farmers-both unhappy with poll promises not being kept. The agrarian distress and lack of job creation have taken the shine off Modi’s ‘booming economy’ pitch and the BJP will be anxious to ensure it doesn’t snowball further. Furthermore, the central government’s rift with the RBI and frequent clash-ins with the Supreme Court have created the image of an overzealous central government keen to take control of all independent central agencies. 

**Will KCR lead for the formation of a Third Front?**

TRS’s emphatic victory in the state of Telangana and K Chandrashekar Rao’s victory speech might mean the resurgence in the chances for the formation of a Third Front consisting of other regional satraps including Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati. The Third Front has traditionally been a cluster of regional parties which choose to neither align with the Congress or the BJP. However, the Third Front, which has always been talked of as an alternative to India’s two-party stronghold, has never managed to give a serious fight to the Congress or the BJP in recent history. The only times the Third Front or Federal Front provided a serious threat to the Congress or BJP was in between 1996 and 1998 when it staked power at the Centre twice under H.D. Deve Gowda. Quite predictably, the government collapsed soon after due to infighting and horse-trading of MPs. 

It will be interesting to see if a Third Front comes into existence in time for 2019 and more interestingly, if they can prevent making the mistakes that they have committed in the past and become a force to reckon with.

**Controversy about EVMs**

Adding further fuel to the EVM tampering controversy, it was reported this week by multiple news sources that CCTV malfunctions occurred in the strongrooms where the EVMs were stored.

China vs. India,24,92ar61,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/92ar61/china_vs_india/,16,"So, the other day, I was having a discussion with a friend of mine. His point was, that communism help China control its population growth, and hence, ultimately its economy. This gist of his argument was that India also needs something of that sort, to put our economy on faster lanes. An example of this that he gave was of protests. They cause a lot of harm to the nation, and need to be suppressed.

I am of a different view altogether. According to me, any country that considers its population an impediment to its growth is going down the wrong track. China could manage its population so easily not because of the One Child Policy, but because they got on the manufacturing bus in time, and mobilised a lot of its rural population to urban areas. Employment lead to education, and that ultimately led to curbing the population growth. Talking about population, let me present the example of Japan. It is one of the country that have high population densities, but managed it so well that Japan was one of the best performing economies in the 2nd half of the 20th century. Their work-ethic and culture, combined with an inclusive government, made them the formidable country they are. Population is anything but a bane for India. All we need is an inclusive government that can actually use the demographic divided that we have. Currently, yes, that is more of a demographic interest for us.

Talking about protests, I am of the idea that they are integral to any democracy. Suppressing and banning them is fascism. Instead, we need a strong police to control them, and better leaders to actually listen to them. Banning protests is like banning fake news channels- which again is fascism. Instead, any fake news should be countered by two different, genuine articles. That's the basic essence of a democracy.

China attained economic prosperity, but at what cost? Millions have been killed trying to oppose the government. Incidents like the The Tiananmen Square show how unstable China can be. What if there's a series of dissents among different levels of the government, or the society? What will China do then?

Towards the end, I would just like to say that we have got to learn nothing from China, save their economic decisions. Communism is never the answer. Democracy is.",clit_obliterator," I know for a fact that China's censoring and general trade protectionism  has allowed domestic companies to flourish . Due to the great digital wall divide search engines like Baidu etc grew .After Google pulled out citing censorship issues . Xiaomi , Huawei etc benefitted from alack of competition to become the global multinationals that they are now . This means that most of the money stays in China where it is recycled endlessly . 

Modi tried to start the Make in India initiative and it has flopped spectacularly . The entrepreneurs require huge capital and due to the hugw amount of NPA 's banks are wary of lending credit to  them .  [deleted] China isn’t communist. It’s socialist. There are some outright contradictions in your post. Of course the words,  ""communism"", ""socialism"", ""liberalism"" has been so corrupted, there is no way to use it, except obviously try to infer what the user means. 

1.

> that communism help China control its population growth, and hence

> Communism is never the answer. Democracy is.

This is not what communism is, you are attributing authoritarianism to an economic idea. The majority of the ""Communist"" examples you know, might be authoritarian but that does not mean democracy and communism or ideas associated with communism are mutually exclusive.
For example [revolutionary catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia#1936_Revolution_and_worker's_self_management) ,
[Makhnovia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Territory) ,
and even currently in [Chiapas, Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Zapatista_Autonomous_Municipalities).

In these examples not only democracy is the most important principal, they also set up their economic systems as syndicalist, anarcho-communist and mutualist, collectivist and mutualist respectively. All these historically and conceptually have been and are very closely associated with ""Communism"".  

2. 

> about protests, I am of the idea that they are integral to any democracy.
 
and,

> we need a strong police to control them

So you want people to protest so that they will end up being forcefully stopped by the state(police).

> Incidents like the The Tiananmen Square

Who do you think the tanks in Tiananmen were sent by? The state right. Then why on earth would you want the police the major perpetrator of state violence be made ""strong""?

3.

> China attained economic prosperity, but at what cost? Millions have been killed trying to oppose the government.

What you are saying is absolutely true but things must compared and put in perspective. Without sounding as an apologist for an authoritarian, genocidal state, lets take the example of healthcare, ~20 million Chinese died in the famine of 1958-61, in India b/w the years 1947-79, every 8 years led to the death of 20 million people. Amartya Sen [writes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine#cite_note-45) about this. Chomsky mentions this [here](https://youtu.be/AHZ4Eut8Tf4?t=63).















 You are way too naive like a school boy . Amartya Sen, India's beloved Development Economist, is a Nobel laureate. One series of essays that won him his prize was the one that talked about famine. It compared famines in British India, Independent India and Mao's China. Obviously, he said the famines in British India amounted to millions of deaths, whereas famines with large-scale deaths by starvation virtually vanished in Independent India, but happened in Mao's China (the Great Leap Forward). His core argument was that droughts are natural disasters but resulting famine and starvation are largely man-made catastrophes, and they cannot happen in democratic societies. This part of his theory was mentioned while he was being awarded the Nobel Prize.  


What was not mentioned was the second half of the theory. China lost a great amount of people during the Great Leap Forward, but India loses a similar amount of people every 10 years due to the inefficiencies of its democracy and corruption in its institutions. China does not. Obviously the Nobel prize committee wanted to emphasise the Western idea that democracy is better in every way, shape or form. This idea has increasingly unravelled with the rise of China.   


China's economy is 5 times the size of India. Even the poorest Chinese people are 5 times richer than the poorest Indians. Although there is a great concentration of wealth in China, it is nothing compared to the concentration of wealth in India. The average Chinese kid is more educated and better-performing at tests than the average Indian kid. What is holding India economically back compared to China? It is the same thing that allowed foreign powers to easily influence India, in fact. It can be answered by one word: caste.  


Read T.K. Ninan's ""The Turn of the Tortoise"". He shows how India invested more in high-performing higher education institutions while not giving the same focus to primary education. China did the exact opposite. As a result, 60% of India's primary school students drop out by year 8 because they are sucked back into family demands. In the meantime, the more privileged people (more higher castes but increasingly the caste-diverse middle class) can safely guarantee quality primary education to their children and send them to better secondary and tertiary education. Ninan says Indians avoid blue-collar jobs even if they are higher-paying and require less travel time than service-oriented jobs. It's easy to see why there's a privileged white-collar upper class while the rest of the population languishes in poverty.   


Meanwhile, China focussed on building the foundation first, rather than the ceiling. Their primary education-focus and work permits to industrial centres promoted and managed a factory-worker class efficiently. Factory workers are only allowed to stay for a few years at most in the big cities -- this is undemocratic but that's how you stop slums from forming. The primary education focus trained a class of people for the manufacturing sector -- possibly the only way to collectively employ 100s of millions of people and improve their living standards. You say China got on the manufacturing bus in time... I'd say they \*created\* the manufacturing bus.  


In what other ways does focussing on primary education and vocational training help a gigantic underdeveloped population? Other than improving living standards, certain development economists think that manufacturing strengthens social bonds as it creates a class of lower-middle to upper-middle class labourers, workers, and eventually managers from among them. They see the turn to idiosyncratic rightwing identity politics in the US and UK as partly caused by the decline of their manufacturing sector and its replacement by a service sector which doesn't present as many opportunities for inter-communal solidarity. What do you have when the manufacturing jobs in your town going away? Drugs, death, reverse-development and no sense of self-worth. The only way you can find self-worth is in your cultural, ethnic identity, making you more socially conservative and hateful of the other. This tears the fabric of these societies. I feel India, due its skipping the manufacturing sector for the service sector, reflects these trends. They are tearing at the fabric of India's society.   


How else does caste affect India? Read ""Where India Goes: Abandoned Toilets, Stunted Development and the Costs of Caste"". I know it is written by non-Indian scholars, but often you need to view of an outsider to see problems you refuse to admit are there. They say the main reason why India lags behind in providing basic sanitary toilets compared to poorer regions like Pakistan, Nepal, sub-Saharan Africa is, you guessed it, caste. This creates a class of children who are even more malnourished and stunted than the Sub-Saharan African average. Healthy nutrition during developmental stages has been strongly linked to intelligence later on in life. Despite India producing a large share of intelligent minds, the average IQ of our country is dismally low. Why? It all traces back to caste discrimination.   


Okay, you say, well, at least India is a global power in the service sectors and with this we can help the underprivileged, right? India's claim to fame, the IT sector, is being eaten up by American and Chinese companies. The IT Sector exports more money in profits than it gives us back in salaries. You can see why China having a Great Firewall, with its own versions of Facebook, WhatsApp etc. turned out to be more profitable strategies.   


I know this all sounds very bleak, because it is, but I tend to be an optimist. Why? Long explanation, but even though India started off democratic, its culture is intrinsically not democratic, and I've already outlined how this hinders a democracy. However, there is still a value to India being democratic: our democracy, hopefully, is succeeding in eroding the non-democratic aspects of culture. We used to be much worse off, but now the mentality of caste is eroding in urban and modernising centres. The most discriminatory practices (sati, etc.) are on the decline. Change is being made. It might not come for another 50-100 years, but I feel Indians will do well despite of their culture and their government. Perhaps eventually, the 2000 year old caste system will be remembered as a dark institution that prevails no more. The first half of the 20th century is definitely China's, but if India escapes its social and economic inequalities in the next 30-40 years, the second half may belong to India. Population is definitely a bane, with AI and more automation in place, there is no need for huge manpower the likes we saw in industrial era.

Also educating people will not help if there is no ways to earn a living. Over-population in the end impacts sustainability and environment. India can never compete with China in anything. If your point is just about population then you would be happy to know that India's birth rate has been falling down for the last 30 years.
 In my opinion, China is a rare example of a ""dictatorship""/one party rule which actually benefited a lot of people (while also messing up/killing a lot of people too).
While we like to diss democracy, history and current events show that people end up being screwed more by dictatorship than democracies. In 99% cases socialism, democracy, capitalism, theocracy etc are all marketing campaigns for a few people to grab power :) China has lots of restrictions on things that we take for granted in India. Like there are websites hugely censored. You cannot search for the tianmen square issues over there afaik. You can search for whatever you want in India.

Even India has adopted a 2 child policy (not a rule). That in itself is against personal freedoms. How can a govt say ‘you can’t have another child?’ Population or not? Sounds a bit preposterous. 

China also struggles with a lack of young people due to having implemented a one child policy in the 70s",Policy/Economy,2018-07-27 16:27:09

Sardar and Legacy [Spiritual Translation of Two Marathi Articles],2,9tsmlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9tsmlb/sardar_and_legacy_spiritual_translation_of_two/,3,"The credit for integrating almost all princely states, barring three, before 15 August 1947 undoubtedly goes to Sardar Patel. But he was of tired body and mind post-independence and post-Gandhi assassination.

It's one thing to like historic fables and another to consider them history. There are often efforts to sell these fables as history. But it's time to look for true history. Currently certain fables are sold as history. Some of them are: Sardar Patel was Hindutvavadi and subsequently anti-Muslim, if he was leading the country instead of Nehru then all of our problems (i.e. Pakistan and Jammu-Kashmir) would've been solved already. Due to wishes of masses, these misunderstandings are considered history. There's effort to sell these fables as history.

First let's tackle most lethel delusion. That is had Mahatma Gandhi not put his weight behind Pandit Nehru, then Sardar Patel would've been our first Prime Minister. A most liked fable in halls of Whatsapp university. Reality however, begs to differ. Pandit Nehru wasn't chosen as Prime Minister at the last minute. It had been going under consideration since 1929. At that time Purna Swaraj (Declaration of Independence of India) under consideration which was officially announced on 26 January 1930. It's leadership came easily under Nehru because he was 2nd most popular leader of Indian National Congress after Gandhi. Then there was a challenge of elections as per Government of India Act 1935. For that, there was no other option than to handover the party presidentship to Nehru. The popularity necessary to win the elections was with Gandhi and Nehru. Sardar Patel was main fundraiser and chairman of Congress' Central Parliamentary Board at that time. However it meant Nehru had bigger responsibility since as a President, he was the face of the party. That is the reason why in 1942 Gandhi declared him as successor. The whole party stood with him and so strong was the resolve that in 1946 - a year before independence - Maulana Abul Kalam Azad resigned presidentship for Nehru.


It's interesting to check the delusions of people who claim Sardar should've been the Prime Minister. After his release from prison in 1945, he was not in good health. He was struggling with diabetes and blood-pressure and his mind was gloomy because of family issues. He had severe heart attack on 4 March 1948, barely a month after Gandhi assassination. Even doctors had given up hopes. Sardar survived but it took a toll on his health. He had said that next news won't be of my sickness but of my death. He died in December 1950. He didn't live to see first general election in India. Nehru was 15 years younger to him. Sardar belonged to generation of Gandhi and Jinnah and three of them died shortly after independence. Sardar Patel's own words are enough to remove any doubt about his desire for Prime Ministership. ""Desire demands youth and health. We have none."" He even conceded that the crowd at Bombay rally had 'come for Jawahar, not for me'.

This should tell us how unrealistic it is to claim Sardar for PM.


Now let us talk about partition. Sardar Patel was one of the first people to agree to partition proposal by Mountbatten. Nehru accepted it later. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on the other hand, staunchly opposed partition till the end. He was of the opinion that India shouldn't be divided. He himself had written it in his 'India Wins Freedom'. It might be politically incorrect to speak highly of Azad in current political climate. But it is documented history. Patel was first one to accept the truth that it isn't right to make Hindus suffer for dream of Undivided India. Nehru and Gandhi followed him to accept the bitter reality. So all three of them are equally 'responsible' for partition. It is  politically convenient to blame partition on Gandhi and Nehru. But it isn't reality. 

Finally, let's talk about his love for Hindutva. He had none as documented by many historians and journalists such as Narhar Kurundkar, Govindrao Talvalkar, Ramchandra Guha, Rafiq Zakaria, even American Vincent Sheean. He had major role in giving religious roles to Indian Muslims. Minority Institues also have special rights thanks to Patel. He never opposed leadership of Khan Abdul Gafar Khan in Northwest region, nor did he oppose Shaikh Abdulla in Kashmir. Not just that, but he never felt to limit rights of Indian Muslims after creation of Pakistan. It is also history that he had admonished Uttar Pradesh's then Chief Minister  Govind Vallabh Pant after idols of Rama were placed in Babri Masjid in 1949. He was of the opinion of resolving the matter through talks. There's also no example of Patel giving different treatment to Hindu and Muslim rulers of Princely states. Hindu Maharaja of Travancore intended to stay independent. So there's no reason to claim that Patel's politics was motivated by religion.  Infact, his outlook towards RSS changed after Gandhi Assassination. Even though the ties between RSS and Gandhi Assassinations were never proved, he was of the opinion to ban it along with Hindu Mahasabha. 

----

A reader called me to accuse that ""your favourite JRD had said, if Sardar Patel had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today"". I spoke with him and by the end of the call he had change of heart. Why? Let's see.

History tells us that Gandhi's economic policies were opposed by Nehru and Patel and two of them also had difference of opinion about it. Nehru's economic policies had layer of naive socialism. Which gave birth to state-owned enterprises. It spread so much that goverment was making wristwatches. Nationalization was core of his economic policies. It's as if he hated the idea of profit. 

JRD and Nehru had disagreement about this point. JRD was of the opinion that it's not government's job to run airline company. It should be noted that JRD's favourite child, Air India was nationalized by Nehru. Patel agreed with JRD on opinion that businesses should be left to businessmen. JRD's opinion was in this context, ""if Sardar Patel was a younger mand and had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today""

Now the caller didn't take into account Patel's health. Nor did JRD speak about Nehru's popularity and politics. His only focus for comparison was economy.

Now let's come to present. Nehru's economic policies were criticised by many political parties, including the one currently in power. The criticism includes inefficieny, irresponsibilty, unnecessary hirings and expenses etc. 

Narasimha Rao took stand against this love for state-owned enterprises. Him and Manmohan Singh opned the doors for economic liberalization. Rao was throughly Congressman. But he didn't hesitate to throw policies of his predecessor in the can. Atal Bihari's government came close to Rao's. He pushed privatization and sold state enterprises operating at loss. As a member of BJP he had right to can Nehru. 

Now Vaypayee's party came to power in 2014. This part is business-friendly and progressive. So it was a given that PSU's will get evem more freedom. Sins of Congress had resulted in loss in banks, air india, and other state enterprises. The BJP's admiration for Patel meant that even more economic improvements would be done. As a sign of their admiration, this goverment decided to build a monument for Patel. So far Congressis had ignored Patel so these people decied to build a statue so tall, you could not ignore it. That's how you pay tribute to your heros!

Around 3000 crores Rupees were spent for this glorious monument. Who paid for it? The caller didn't know. 

So this is the list of generous people who contributed to this monument, in Rupees:

- Indian Oil - 900 Crores

- Oil and Natural Gas Commission - 500 Crores

- Bharat Petroleum - 450 Crores

- Hindustan Petroleum - 250 Crores

- Oil India - 250 Crores

- Gas Authority of India - 250 Crores

- Power Grid - 125 Crores

- Gujrat Mineral Development Corporation - 100 Crores

- Engineers India - 50 Crores

- Petronet India - 50 Crores

- Balmer Lawrie - 6 Crores

Does the list ring any bell? All of these are Government owned companies. Who were born because of Nehruvian economics and policies,  which was opposed by Sardar Patel. And his monument is now funded by the same companies.

And the money comes from Corporate Social Responsibility funds of these companies, even written down for preservation ofr arts and culture by some of them.

Who is preserving whose which legacy? Food for thought.",ArchangelleSnek," Link to original articles:

crypto mining craze, its dying out but the effects will stay till 2018.

GST

40% tax on personal imports + GST. 7y months ago i got an rx480 for 14K, its 40K now I was charged 18% GTS on GTX 1050ti cost 12k and G5460 cost 5k.   gst is wrong answer its rolled in india but card prices have gone up across globe....its   because of crypto currency(ethereum) mining..jan it was near 7-8 dollar per eth then in may it went 300 dollar  which led to the price rise. High video cards  end cards like 1080 and ti  and low end 1050ti 1050 460 560   version are not affected by this ,most affected card  are amd rx 470-480-570-580  they are going for double there base price 1060 1070 is good cheap alternative thts why it has gone up but as price of eth has stabilized they have gone back to ""normal"" , u wont find amd cards easily they have been out stock nearly every where across globe.. imported items have seen massive price rise. tronsmart usb-c/qc3 powerbank was selling on amazon for around 2100 few months ago. after gst, it disappeared and only became available 2-3 days ago for 3100 rupees. anker powerport+ usb-c pd charger was selling for around 2800 bucks before gst. it also disappeared and came back for around 4500. managed to get it during a recent sale for under 3000 bucks. it is again out of stock and an alternative listing has it priced at 7999 rupees. pretty insane. no good alternatives as local manufacturers do not make good quality usb-c accessories. quantumzero recently launched a few products. amazonbasics is another good option but no power banks or chargers.

It's just that not all of them used to pay taxes in entirety and used to pass on some of the savings to the customers as ""discounts"". That is not happening anymore that is all. I'm not saying the price should remain that high. It should come down, I'm not sure if it will happen at MRP level or at GST level. GPUs are in high demand due to cryptocurrency mining.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.


",unfitforoffice," Wow. TLDR? Wow what a nice read. But there was no mention of famines or partitions. Were they not back-breaking for the economy? [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. 
 >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. 

I'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice ""peaceful."" Have read the whole thing.
The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Personally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. 

Both Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor's British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because ""he is one of us"". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the ""it"" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because ""they stand for Hindu values"" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife's) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.

It is really simplistic to claim Britain ""looted"" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India's wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor's fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he's going to use this wave of false patriotism that's been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is ""overall a good thing"" even if it did help turn someone's life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

As I've been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides, accepting English IS decolonization. Glad to see an academic agree. I can drink his urine straight from source Brilliant. Learned a lot about myself and my country...  Brilliant article. Its important to see good arguments from both sides. Thanks for sharing.",Policy/Economy,2017-09-11 19:45:04
The identity crisis of Middle India,136,63dbev,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63dbev/the_identity_crisis_of_middle_india/,185,"It is often said of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, that he was the last Englishman to rule India. The saying carries some element of truth to it. Nehru may have been born in Allahabad, but his heart lay in the Shires and Oxbridge. This showed through in his language, cultural sensibilities, and overall, the parliamentary democracy that he guided us towards. He was a towering intellect, but unlike his contemporaries who were by and large bilingual intellectuals, his writings were mainly in English. He could give a speech in Hindi, but his knowledge of the tongue ended there. His sensibilities were English and it is to his credit that being so English and upper class as he was, he could mingle with just about anyone from the classes or the masses in a country as diverse as India.

One of Nehru’s primary concerns at Independence was the building of a national identity. India, under the British, was a loose confederation of states that recognized the paramountcy of the British and its people subscribed to only a vague sense of ‘Indian-ness’ that was never formally defined. Nor was such a definition even required. The Tamil in the far south was as unconcerned with the Punjabi in the far north, as was the Bengali with the Gujarati. As far as the common man was concerned, they mainly subscribed to more or less the same set of cultural values. There really was no concept of a political union called India. Indeed, the idea of a country called India, was born with independence and the dissolution of the British raj. However, the dissolution of the British Raj also brought with it partition and all its communal horrors. The lack of a common identity between the Hindu and the Muslim tore once harmonious communities apart. Nehru and his contemporaries realized that the fabric that held this nation together was frayed at the edges and would soon tear apart. It was of utmost importance, therefore, to cultivate a common identity of Indian-ness, and suppress any alternate cultural or regional identity.

We have all been part of this identity formation, whether it took the form of singing the national anthem every morning at school, or by learning the names of various and far flung rivers of the nation. And by and large, we have succeeded. A Tamilian today cheers for “Enga thalai Dhoni”, a man from Ranchi, Jharkhand with as much fervor as the Punjabi, the Bengali or the Gujarati. A common identity has been built and there is little talk of separatism in the Indian heartland. What separatism exists has literally been pushed to the fringes of the nation and is on the verge of fizzling out itself. The political unification of India has been a success.

Culturally though, we remain as diverse as ever, and a unified identity is something that is neither attainable nor desirable. In many areas of India, language remains a prickly subject and it is quite common to hear diatribes against linguistic minorities and those who do not speak the language native to the area they stay in. However, even this problem of communication has been resolved by that great gift of Empire, the English language. If two people from any of the country’s opposite extremes were to converse, they would use the English language to great effect. Indeed, this has even resulted in an amalgamated language called ‘Inglish’ which has created a cultural identity and linguistic space of its own.

Socially too, we are as diverse and it must be said, as divided as ever. Perhaps more so in the present than at any time in the past, near or ancient. India has always had a divided society. The caste system effectively divides us into haves and have-nots, where the have-nots outnumber the haves by a large sum. The have-nots, by virtue of their numbers are at the bottom of the pyramid, and the haves are right on top. This caste based division of society is often reflected in the economic sphere as well. The upper castes are in most cases, very well off. The lower castes tend to be among the poorer and more downtrodden sections of the society. Consequently the aspirations of the haves are vastly different from the aspirations of those at the lower half of the pyramid. This social pyramid has been the template for every society since the beginning of time. The upper classes, the middle classes and the lower classes are at various times dominant separately, but their composition remains pretty much the same. When the aspirations of one of these classes are not met, a society will experience upheaval. In the case of the lower classes, it is revolution. For the others, this upheaval takes the form of a flight to greener pastures. It is this upheaval that India is facing today.

The Indian state in the past sixty years has done a decent, though by no means complete, job of providing for the basic (and here I must stress on the word basic) aspirations of the lower rungs of the pyramid. The Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has been taken care of for many Indians. Food security was achieved quite a while ago, while our housing situation too has not been too bad. Again, I must remind the reader that there is much to be done, but there has been a good deal of coverage in this area. In the case of the better off citizen of this nation, the Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has always been taken care of. It is something else that he aspires too. These aspirations may take the form of entertainment, social standing, a certain lifestyle or even the choice of clothing. It is a matter of debate as to whether these aspirations have been fulfilled or not. Certainly, the cities of India hold all the ingredients to provide for these aspirations. And yet, it is seen that they do not and the urban youth have flocked to greener pastures abroad like migratory wildebeest. The logical conclusion in this case is that the aspirations of the urban youth have changed and these aspirations are something that Indian society cannot fulfill.

And so what are the aspirations of the urban, educated, elite of this nation? Certainly education and employment is readily available. Admission into an IIT/NIT, or barring that, an educational institute of similar standing is within their reach. A degree in Engineering guarantees every one of them gainful employment with a salary that can ensure a comfortable lifestyle. Some of them go in for a post graduate degree or diploma in management or business administration. A resume containing all this can lead to a very comfortable lifestyle with excellent prospects for any young Indian with an eye on his future. And yet, it is not sufficient to ensure that he or she does not take flight to greener pastures? What then, are the greener pastures that they aspire to?

Everyone has heard of the brain drain of the 70’s and 80’s. Educated Indians fled abroad in huge numbers, stymied by the lack of opportunities in this land. It was a great loss yes, but one could understand why they left. India in those days was in a socialist paroxysm. The license-quota-permit Raj that Nehru set up stifled creativity and business enterprise. Jobs were hard to come by in an economy with a ‘Hindu-rate-of-growth’ and as a result doctors, engineers and scientists fled this country for the US, helping to build societies there. Today however, the nation is better poised to provide employment and opportunities to its engineers and doctors. And yet, they continue to leave in droves. What then, are the opportunities that they are looking for?

Nehru tried hard to build a common identity for this nation. Today, nearly fifty years after his death, it is hard to say if he has succeeded or not. There is a political and cultural union called India. There is also a growing population of youth that hardly even identifies itself with this nation and its people and culture anymore. They identify themselves with the West. And it is in search of this identity, that they surge westwards in increasing numbers every year.

When I asked why they wished to leave this nation, I received many replies.. Some are insightful, some well thought out, and some are purely cynical and selfish, though unbeknownst to the person concerned.

One worshipper of the Western way of rational thought spoke in raptures about their technological and industrial prowess and glowingly described their plans to build a magnetically levitated high speed rail system. He noted that his own nation that had fed, housed and educated him for twenty five years was a “backward shithole that did not invent anything of note”, thus conveniently discarding the fact that it took the United States a hundred years to reach where it is now, while India is still suffering from its birth pangs.

A young lady of my acquaintance described India as a selfish, repressed society of bullies who could not be counted upon to elect a capable Prime Minister. She was “sick of the way we use age old methods that cannot be integrated into modern society, Must it be taught to even respect equally?”. She was right, to an extent. But it is doubtful if she would ever find a society that respects equally, where bullying is not tolerated and is not parochial and narrow minded in some sense. It also took all of my self control to keep from reminding her that Donald Trump has been elected to the most powerful office in the world.

The real reason, one that they are loathe to acknowledge, is that they no longer identify with the people around them anymore. Indeed, the vast majority of Indians are invisible to them and when they do make an appearance in their lives, they are disgusted and feel alienated. They would rather not acknowledge the presence of those whose aspirations are to merely survive, than to sit in a bar the whole day and drink beer and discuss the latest happenings in International politics. Fed on a relentless diet of Americana, they do not identify with Indian events, Indian characters, Indian food, drink or even other Indians anymore. The television shows they watch are American. The food that they eat is American. The books they read are American. The language they are most comfortable with is American. The news channels they are most familiar with show local American news. Indeed, they would know more about the political system of the USA than of their own nation.  The latest agendas of the latest Senatorial candidates would be on their fingertips. What would not be on their minds, is the names of their MP’s and MLA’s back home.

One of the most absurd things I have heard of in recent times is the news that a socialist has been elected to the Seattle city council. That a socialist has been elected in the USA itself is absurd enough. But what makes the news even more absurd is the fact that the candidate who campaigned on a socialist platform was an Indian who was raised in India, was educated in India, was in all likelihood a beneficiary of all the post liberalization reforms of the Government of India. Like everyone else in her generation, she would have been the first to demand reforms and the lifting of India’s socialist policies and yet, when she emigrated to the US, rediscovered the socialist in herself, because she could not bear to see the suffering of the American masses under the yoke of capitalism. It reeks of hypocrisy. Would she do the same thing in India? No. In India, the very same candidate would have triumphantly pointed to the benefits of our liberalization and campaigned for a right wing party, merely because the reforms have benefitted her tiny group of elites who reside on the top of the pyramid at the expense of those at the bottom. But of course, they do not even exist for her. Instead, she chose to fight for the American’s Roti, Kapada, aur Makaan, because – “ It is easier to convince 300 million literate people to vote for you, than to convince 1 billion illiterate people, never mind that they are your own people.”. There is a word to describe such people. It is ‘mercenary’. But then, what can you expect of a people who would rather celebrate Halloween to Holi?

It is easier to convince three hundred million literates to vote for you. It is far more difficult for these people to convince the one billion Indians who are their countrymen to vote for them because they do not even speak their language. Indeed, they do not even make an effort to learn their own mothertongue and identify with the rest of their society. This laziness to push themselves and achieve something points to a deeper malaise in our psyche. In other words, this generation of Indians has ‘Aspirations, but no Ambitions’. They feel apart from the world around them and would rather run away to the West than do anything about the very society that gave birth to them, but cannot satisfy their outsize American aspirations. And why would they not? They are Americans in all but name.

**TL;DR - Our urban youth emigrate because they are culturally American and do not even identify themselves as Indian anymore.**",conqueror_of_destiny," [deleted] You know what that they saying about dignity and poverty? That's a fucking lie, there is no dignity in poverty. As much as no one should be ashamed of manual labor, there is no dignity to it. We live in a country where most of the middle class is one incident away from living on the street. For all our governments talk of healthcare, its still not enough to cover any serious illness. There is no unemployment pay for the millions of young people desperately searching for jobs and educational institutions except for the rich or immensely talented have failed at delivering any qualifications or education to the masses.

As to identity, I am from the North East, plunged into an insurgency for 40+ years by incompetent Indian admistration, I barely speak Hindi, I come from such a mixed family background that I have no mother language or culture though I can speak or most of it, I hate having to stand up for nonsense like national anthems, I celebrate independence day by take a hiking trips to the wilderness, but at the end of the day I still consider myself Indian, I don't feel ashamed of it, I recognize the problems of my country and am willing to make contributions to it. There is no identity problem, people are quite aware of what it means and what it takes to be an Indian. Not everyone can handle it.

I don't envy or hate those Indians who want to leave, I understand the reasons. I don't think I would leave though. [deleted] I perfectly identify as being Indian. I consume American drivel in copious doses. I don't even know what would be a culturally perfect Indian thing; Bollywood offends my tamil brothers and I can't comprehend their jalebis. I am a nationalist and Hindi is my mother tongue but it's been more than a decade since I wrote anything in devnagri. I once nearly emigrated. I don't belive that idea of India was a British construct. I don't think the poorly educated are dumb as rhe source of Wisdom isn't just books but also experiences. I am not alone.   I think you have used instances that suit your narrative and bias and have come to your conclusion. You have not objectively analyzed anything before making a sweeping conclusion. Bhaisahab, if you want to bash American culture, atleast don't use Americanisms like ""Middle America"" mindlessly. Middle Indians are Madhya Pradeshis,Chhatisgarhi and Jharkhandi. Are you referring to them? I didnt even read your post after reading the TL;Dr cuz its outright BS

People emigrate because dollar is stronger so pay is better and the way of life thare is better Where the heck did you get this from?

No typos, text is correct, grammar is accurate, insight is spot on.

Theres a structure, and each point flows into the next.

BC, kahan se aaye ho?

Edit: Since you are getting a lot of flak.

1) Kudos, the points raised are well framed and match a lot of reality

2) Your tldr is unweildly for such a wide ranging argument, and doesnt correctly convey the same spectrum held in the larger piece. > There really was no concept of a political union called India. Indeed, the idea of a country called India, was born with independence and the dissolution of the British raj.

LOL. This is something British say to cover up their colonial atrocities and convince the world that Colonism helped India. The Idea of India existed thousands of years before British came to India. 

> The upper castes are in most cases, very well off. The lower castes tend to be among the poorer and more downtrodden sections of the society. 

Even after caste based reservations for more than 60 years. Why does this exist? It's not like upper caste people cheat and get all the facilities or money meant for lower caste people. And, most importantly do upper caste people get anything extra from the government that lower caste people do not get? Why is the upper caste without reservation haves and lower caste people with reservation have-nots? > Our urban youth emigrate because they are culturally American and do not even identify themselves as Indian anymore.

What does identifying oneself as Indian mean ?  Came here to identify myself as Madhya Pradeshian.....left after wall of texts >They would rather not acknowledge the presence of those whose aspirations are to merely survive, than to sit in a bar the whole day and drink beer and discuss the latest happenings in International politics.

This is really true the way you put it. Forget the divide in religion, ethnicity or caste. There's a divide between people who are westernised and those that are not. A Muslim or Hindu who visits pubs, dates multiple women, talks in English, listens to English songs has nothing in common with a migrant Muslim/Hindu from Bihar.  
You can see this thin fabric of divide whenever you visit any posh or happening locality of your city. Look at the tapri wala watching party goers as a crippled child watches kids playing from his window. * Nice copy/paste

 I was half-expecting another thread on English and how it is ""destroying"" Indian languages. These types of articles are, ironically enough, always written by the same people who most fit the stereotypes of their descriptions.

You have this endless navel-gazing and insecurity complex by the English-speaking elites. It's crude narcissism at its worst. Nobody literally gives a shit about these questions except them. And they keep writing the same shit over and over, without realising that they never write anything new, just re-iterating on the same narrative endlessly. 

It's quite telling that the OP writes ""Middle India"". But this is not about middle India. Middle India is quite poor and doesn't speak English. This is the narcissism of a tiny elite which thinks it is original and speaking for the nation. It does neither.  no, i choose to remain here and trigger all the anti-liberals/anti-intellectuals/anti-secularists/hindutvavadis. it gives me great pleasure to not respect the so called ""culture"" and ""traditions"" of india and juxtapose my ""non-indian"" lifestyle on all those who have the fortune/misfortune to meet me. after all, why should i leave? i earn enough to have a comfortable life and also have enough savings and investments to fall back on.  > culturally American

thats an insult Too much generalisation here. But upvoted for the effort  I eat Samosa Jalegi, I also watch Bhai movies, but I live in Phoren.  Thank you for a good read. I don't agree with some of your points, but thank you for taking the time to articulate your thoughts in a forum where participants are notorious for attacking each other over the smallest of things.

As for me personally, I primarily moved to the US in search of better pay, and to support my aging parents. The clean air & transparent governance is a nice bonus :) After all, I did just fine without them for the first 25 years of my life. In my brief experience with Indians (my family included), people tend to put self before family before religion/community before municipality before city before state before country. To this end, the notion of identifying as an Indian is low among most people's priorities. It's fair to say that I consume a good amount of Americana, but that is because while good Indian content exists, it is buried under mountains of rubbish. I do my best to assimilate: date non-Indians exclusively, refuse to hang out with Indians that only hang out with other Indians, among other things. Moving here forced me to think of myself as a (sigh!) global citizen, but that may be as you pointed out, for lack of a real identity.

Thank you for kicking off this discussion, proofreading your text and having the balls to post to r/india. RIP. I have just this to say. You assume to know that you understand what those 'acquaintances' of yours were thinking. Their upbringing exposed them to different experiences and their perspectives were shaped because of them. They are doing their best to do what they believe in. Respect the choices made by your fellow human beings and accept that you cannot ever fully understand their perspective. They are right, and so are you. I now stand ready to be crucified by the denizens of Randia who yearn for the promised land but are held prisoner in this land most foul by ties of family, economy and society.

Edit : I demand trial by combat!  About as much logic as a WhatsApp forward, no matter how sincerely you express yourself. Singular opinions and manipulated conversations do not prove your point.  Jo Mann mein aaya woh likh dene se wo sach begin ho jata.


Nehru didn't know Hindi ? Where did you get this info from ? He has written books and letters in Hindi as well as Urdu  What is American Kucha? Someone ELI5.  I also consume Western (mainly American) Drivel. I have seen and learned from my sibling and friends. ~~They~~ We are into things which add no real value to our lives but entertainment. And entertained we are. Consumed in Western Music, movies, books, TV and pop culture and politics even. And that's okay I think. But I don't get the point of having a comic con here or celebrating Halloween and dissing our own festivals and melas.  
  
I think Education abroad has just become *Paisa Phek Tamasha Dekh* now a days. Gone are the days when you really used to go on merit basis to gain knowledge through World class education. Get the edge and real value. Now just about anyone who has grown up watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S with surplus funds from parents wants higher education abroad. It's been a trend for some time now and that trend is becoming a problem. Saturation of jobs! Both for the locals and the immigrants. Thanks to Trump that bubble is soon about to burst. I personally know people who have no business being there. They are average at studies or any other talents. Just there so they don't get crushed under peer pressure and miss having that experience of MS in US. We need to have a change in our collective thought pattern.   Very well written, extremely thought provoking. Kudos.  Well done for writing such a long post. I need to read it again before commenting as there's quite a lot to digest. TLDR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8ljRgcJNM I view this slightly differently. Replace Americana with neoliberalism.

There is a certain strand of neoliberalism that is dominating thought processes throughout the world. It is driven by globalists. Its drivers are the ability maximize profit and move power away from nations to an international elite who belong to no country as such.

The pillars of neoliberalism are multinational corporations, tech companies and internet itself, hollywood, united nations, world bank, weapons manufacturers etc.

Economically the people who are part of this neoliberal bubble have been winning every contest so far.

People who participate in this bubble wrt USA are owners of corporations who benefit from cheap labor and market around the globe for their products.

Indian urban youth because they want to be able to work for global corporations because they obviously pay more because global corporations are more becoming more successful. They are invested in US/UK politics because their participation in the neoliberal bubble depends on it.

Political leaders who push for breaking down of national barriers for free movement of people are succeeding because they are backed by these corporations.

I strongly feel so because these neoliberals feel alien to their countrymen everywhere.

1. Hollywood/LA is accused of being eastern oriented. They follow various fads like buddism, hinduism etc that are completely alien to other Americans. Indian neoliberals are accused of being westward looking. 

2. Indian neoliberals look towards Hollywood, participate in feminism, work in tech companies etc.

3. Anti-Brexiters were accused of being globalists who were out of touch with their fellow countrymen belonging to working class.


I feel that your Seattle example fits into this. Seattle is a neoliberal hub. Its constituents are extremely intolerant to beliefs that go against neoliberalism. Other cities are NYC, London, LA, Singapore, Hong Kong, Seoul, Paris etc.

Within India cities that are shining are Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Gurgaon, Chennai and all these cities are more integrated with the global interests than others. What you have described is ""Cultural Marxism"". Even the European countries have a problem with it. > In India, the very same candidate would have triumphantly pointed to the benefits of our liberalization and campaigned for a right wing party, merely because the reforms have benefitted her tiny group of elites who reside on the top of the pyramid at the expense of those at the bottom.

When one is comfortable in life, people would like to extend the area of influence. A normal selfish activity and no hypocrisy. When asked, people may under circumstances come up with rational sounding arguments.

>It is easier to convince 300 million literate people to vote for you

Human wants, needs and pleasures across literate and illiterate vary very little. Reading novels from Chetan Bhagat or Yandamuri [of telugu] are not very different. So is reading Gita and Marcus Aurelius. Or drinking in a pub or the local bhatti. Or watch a movie in Gold class or local shop. Or banging aish or local one. wearing Skynn or nirod. 

Trend is you call someone illiterate if one cannot hold a conversation with the person. This is possibly owing to our own range. In my personal experience, (of course, anecdotal) my gardener, maid and watchman have figured out things clearly and can manage their customers better than the folks I meet at office. All there of them have not passed 5th standard. There is a story that might be able to help you OP. It's a story about Odyssues (an explorer) and the Sirens. From Greek Mythology. I think it's relevant for our identity.

>Taking a large block of beeswax, a gift from Circe, Odysseus breaks it into small pieces and gives one to each of his men. He tells them to soften it and put it into their ears. In this way, they will not hear the song of the Sirens.

>But Odysseus wants to hear that famous song and still survive. Circe has told him how to do it.

>He orders his sailors to tie him firmly to the ship’s mast. When he is firmly tied, and his men have the beeswax in their ears, they row their ship alongside the island.


 Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I am one of those urban youth who emigrated to US. I think if you consider society to be people residing within the physical boundaries of a nation, then your reasoning is spot on. But if you consider a society as a community of people sharing ideas, creations, goods, services, etc., the whole world is now closer to being a single society than ever before. I appreciate all the help that this country and people offered me in my growth and I am trying to pay it forward. However, please don't negate influences from all those western ideas and people either. If it were not for them, we probably would have a hard time growing as individuals and as a country. If you take all the positive influences towards any individual and tag their origin as ""Indian"" or ""Western"", I reckon there is a significant percentage of it from ""Western"". Why then shouldn't they be ""paid back""?

I think a lot of people mistake all those folks who leave this country for greener pastures. The fact that those folks are still in touch with their friends and family back home, and that there is a constant to-and-fro communication of ideas and experiences means that they never ""left"" this society. You may not see or meet them on a daily basis but they aren't that far. It's just that some of our aspirations require us to move beyond the physical boundaries of this nation. If being Indian is about following a culture, we are all Indians. If Indian is based on location of residence, then probably we aren't. But then, we are just talking semantics. Indian physicist inventing some cool theorem in some random lab in the US is helping a random Indian as much as an Indian physicist doing the same in one of the Indian labs.  Individuals make up families, families make up communities, communities come together and make up a country. No matter what the political, social or cultural background of a country, **a country can be happy only if individuals are happy**. Iran with 5000 years of golden history, is today a failed state and Israel with 5000 years of culture, is barely propped up with American help and can collapse any day. Japan with 2000 years of culture is an American puppet state and so is Korea. 

If you think present-day youth have an obligation towards their community or ethnic race or should obey what Nehru planned for India half-a-century ago, you are putting the cart before the horse, and expecting the cart should pull the horse by itself.

Nobody (unless they go out of their way unprovoked to hate India or other Indians) have any colonized mindset just because they are interested or consume Western media. The fact is that India is no longer an isolated country, the channels of communication with the world has opened up, along with increased individual power, mobility and self-reliance. The Indian identity is simply the identity of its people, and it is a lived experience and value system of its people - and what ever we choose it to be. **To deny that would be to dismiss the life experiences and individual choices people make**, which goes against the spirit of a democracy. 

 ""Demo"" means people. The Republic of India, to which we are legally bound citizens, is a democracy, not a culturocracy. **Democracy is not merely choice of government, a democracy is choice of defining the Indian identity as we see fit.** This is a right and freedom our constitution guarantees us and and people have died and martyred and shed their blood to gain this freedom. This is dumpster-tier drivel. Never in human history have a people been so adamant on destroying their own rich linguistic history, and own languages, literally crawling over each other to adopt language of an oppressing colonial slave master that occupied their country and committed horrible genocides on them. And politicians apathetically support this.

Thus you have millions of people who have identity crisis, unsure of what to speak, stripping the very base of human civilization. They can't effectively learn or be skilled in a foreign medium forced down their throats, creating bad human capital in business terms. And they can't even get jobs if they keep speaking their own languages. They have to Ispik Ingalish so that Anglophile turds on the higher levels can be appeased, to even hope to live out.

The Rice of Wrath: How Obscure British Land Law and Free Electricity Created Economic Stagnation and Environmental Disaster in Punjab [Policy],22,86w3s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/86w3s1/the_rice_of_wrath_how_obscure_british_land_law/,16,"Punjab has been the breadbasket of India since the colonial era. The British recruited heavily from rural Punjab for it’s armed forces, and recognized that is was vital to keep rural Punjab prosperous and satisfied. The government invested heavily in irrigation and enacted laws favorable to farmers. Famine nearly struck Bihar and Maharashtra in the after independence, and the new government was desperate to raise agricultural yields. The government of India embraced the Green Revolution, and no region more than Punjab. Punjab led India in the adoption of high value seeds, irrigation and fertilizer. An entire policy regime was constructed to benefit farmers and to increase food production.
However, this policy regime is misfiring badly today. The Green Revolution is over in Punjab, and the state is struggling to reorient itself in an economy where agriculture is no longer paramount. Free electricity to farmers to keep pumps running constantly, causing the water table to drop to dangerous levels while starving the state government of the funds necessary to modernize the economy. Today’s podcast episode is about the weight of history on economic development in Punjab and the struggle to transition from the successes of the Green Revolution to a truly modern economy.",gnikivar2, You cannot exactly say that the policy misfired. The policy was created to raise yields and it did do so. I would argue one of the most successful schemes of the Indian government. Well it is really no big deal that Punjab's growth has fallen. It always was a land big on agriculture lacking in mineral resources. There is limited growth beyond agriculture. The real growth nowadays is in Central India What podcast is this?  Free electricity is bad. Both for energy sector and ground water. They should ban export of water intensive crops like rice and sugarcane  Haryana’s economy seems to be doing really well though.

We really need to talk about Flairs.,108,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",Policy/Economy,2017-05-15 21:21:16
"Debunked: ""Do the maths: India's first bullet train isn't 'free of cost' as Modi claims"" - lazy journalist",96,717dlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/717dlb/debunked_do_the_maths_indias_first_bullet_train/,45,"The article in question: http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/do-the-math-india-s-first-bullet-train-isn-t-free-of-cost-as-modi-claims-117091800116_1.html

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

###But wait! There's more:


>The 508km-long Mumbai to Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) is scheduled for completion in December 2023, but commencement date has been sought to be advanced to August 2022.

>Initially, each high speed train will have 10 cars and the capacity to accommodate 750 people, The Times of India said. It will increase to 16 cars that will accommodate 1,200 people.

>According to initial estimates, around 1.6 crore people are expected to travel by the bullet train annually. By 2050, around 1.6 lakh commuters should travel by the high-speed train on a daily basis.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

Is this sarcasm? I mean, most of the things mentioned in this article are detrimental to the common man. Highlights include:

* Growth in rural wages has been curtailed. This ensures that the reserve army of the underemployed continues to exert a downward pressure on wages.
* The ruling party’s ideology of religious nationalism has the merit of distracting the attention of the masses waiting impatiently for the fruits of development to trickle down. The hard work put in by the ruling party’s grassroots organizations has done much to steer away the poorer castes and classes from militant demands that interfere with the process of capital accumulation. As the Roman satirist Juvenal said, it is necessary to provide both bread and circuses to the masses.
* The presence of a strong charismatic leader is a big help in developing an anti-liberal mass base and ensuring right-wing policies are implemented. The government has done its best to neutralize the left wing and has placed its nominees in crucial positions in important institutions. Recall that all the East Asian miracle economies had their growth spurts under autocratic governments.

I didn't name the Prime Minister's because although they are important figures, they are not integral. Also something I realised is that each leader is burdened by the legacy and shadow of their predecessor while setting the stage for their successor. 

Unlike the title of Sanjay Baru's book, there are no Accidental Prime Ministers. 

 Well, being from NIT, the idea to convert REC to NIT by Vajpayee was a game changer. The 17 Regional Engineering Colleges were established in the major states of India as a cooperative venture between the central and respective state governments. In 2002, the Indian government decided to upgrade all Regional Engineering Colleges (""RECs"") to NITs and later raised a few other reputed government colleges.

"Understanding the Petro Dollar, its possible decline, Fiat Currencies and how it all affects India and Why maybe it's time to look elsewhere to hold foreign reserves.",54,6z7u08,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6z7u08/understanding_the_petro_dollar_its_possible/,45,"The whole thing came up recently during some discussions I had about why people use the dollar for international trade and what would happen if the major economies of the world just stopped using the Dollar. What is the Impact of BRICS. Why US has so many wars in the middle east and they are supposedly for oil but they never really take over any oil. How US is so rich to have 800 military bases around the world with a defence budget larger than the rest of the world combined. About why countries still hold US dollar reserves when US is in trillions of dollars of debt and being in so much debt, how is US economy still afloat? So I thought of putting it together here for myself and anyone else who may want to learn about this. Now, this is what I have gleaned from my reading on the matter. I am no economist so if anyone wants to correct me on anything, I would be welcome to accept the criticism with reference material substantiating your point.

 in 1944, all the countries entered into the Bretton Woods Agreement which basically said that all of the world’s currrecies would be backed by the US Dollar and the US dollar would be backed by gold and any country could convert their currency into US dollars and then redeem US gold in exchange for that at the rate of 35 dollars per ounce of gold. Since US had the largest gold reserves at the time (75% of the entire world's gold), everyone agreed. This also allowed US treasury to fix exchange rates of dollar into different currencies and set the interest rates for interbanking transactions etc. However, the multiple wars of the US during the ’60s caused domestic inflation in the US and the value of Dollar to fall. This caused panic in all the countries and they started redeeming gold from US treasury. The US gold fell from 20,000 tonnes to 8100 tonnes very quickly. Thus, in 1971, Nixon closed the gold window i.e. he suspended the ability of any nation to redeem US gold against dollars and took the gold backing off of the US Dollar. While that allowed US to retain its gold reserves, it made the need of the US dollar among other countries non existent. So everyone started to move away from the Dollar. After that, US economy started to spiral and the price of gold became 135 dollars per ounce. On top of that, the Arab world hiked the oil prices. Now, the US desperately needed to stabilize the spiral. So they brokered a deal with the Saudis that the oil producers would not only trade oil in nothing but US Dollars and convince the OPEC (the middle eastern, north African and other oil producing countries) to do the same but also invest their (OPEC’s) oil profits in US treasury by buying US Treasury bonds. This basically means that they (OPEC) are buying out US debt. Not only this, US is printing Dollars against the amount of Foreign investments in the US treasury which is made by Oil producing nations which are their oil profits. So basically, profits from every barrel sold by OPEC make way to the US treasury and become the value against which dollars is printed. Ultimately, more the profits in oil, stronger the dollar and lesser the profits in oil, weaker the dollar. Thus US gets a double benefit out of every barrel of oil in a way. In exchange the US would sell them (Saudis) advance weapons and all the gold they demanded. (So basically weapons and gold sale in exchange for trading oil in dollars props up US dollar. Gold is still propping up US dollar indirectly by forcing the oil producers to trade in dollars). Thus the petrodollar was born. This caused the world to need US dollar again. If you wanted to buy oil, you needed US dollar by either converting your currency or by selling stuff to the US. The latter is more preferred as it is cheaper than exchanging your currency and also grows your economy. So once again, US became the benchmark of international trade since no country can hope to grow its economy without using energy aka oil and you can’t have oil without US dollars. As long as all these countries need oil, US can just print Dollars out of thin air and balance it against oil barrels (as explained above) without actually even owning a single drop of oil. (Other countries need to own the gold that they balance their currency against). US does not need to control oil, they just need to control the currency it is traded in to keep their economy afloat. (more on that later in US foreign policy). Similarly, US bokered a deal with the Latin American countries to not only trade in the US Dollar but also to give precedence to US, EU and Japanese products in trade. So if more and more countries decide to shun the dollar and trade in other currencies, this would eventually cause OPEC to switch as well and Dollar could collapse.

How? Well, US is basically just printing enormous amounts of money out of thin air. This money is being used domestically and to a much larger extent, globally. If international oil trade in dollar stops, people stop needing the dollar and use their own currency. So all the internationally circulating dollars would come back to US. Now that is just too many dollars against very little amount in the treasury and that would cause hyperinflation and economic spiral. However, the logical next step would be to just destroy the excess dollars coming in from abroad and that would keep the country’s economy afloat. While that is okay but remember, what is the dollar being printed against? The foreign investments in the treasury which are the profits from the oil trade in dollars. That would go away as well essentially leaving nothing in the treasury against which the dollar is valued. Hence dollar will literally not be worth the money it is printed on.

Second, since US currency is basically a petrodollar, its power depends on the control of oil. So right now, whoever controls middle east has major power. Today, Saudi Arabia controls Middle East and US controls Saudi Arabia. US-Saudi brotherhood sort of makes it impossible for other countries to have an influence over this. Russia has tried for decades to establish a strong foothold in the middle east but has been unsuccessful. It has also dictated the US foreign policy far the last 5 decades. Like I said, US needs to control not the oil reserves but the currency oil is traded in. Hence all the wars we hear that were for oil, were not actually for oil per se but intimidation tactics against countries that announced that they would no longer accept dollar as a currency in international oil trade. Egs When the Ayatollah of Iran announced their intention to denounce dollars in oil trade and use their own currency instead, US backed Iraq to go to war with Iran and even provided the Weapons of mass destruction to use on Iran that they later used as an excuse to invade Iraq and prosecuted Saddam Hussein for. When Iraq invaded Kuwait ( a major producer of oil) to be able to pay their loans to Kuwait and then later asked for Euro to be used for oil trade rather than Petrodollar, US invaded Iraq. When Gaddafi asked gold based Dinar instead of US dollars for oil trade, US invaded Libya. When Chavez did the same, Us staged a coup in Venezuela. However, starting a non-petro currency would break this link and oil and Middle east would become less relevant for Economic power and only be of interest for energy concerns. It is still important but less so than a economic and geopolitical chessboard of US that it is today. It may actually be a solution to achieving peace in the middle east.

However, another thing that happens is Middle East controls prices of oil which is tied to the Dollar. Recently, the Middle East (OPEC or basically Saudi Arabia) has decided to drop the international prices for their own economic reasons. Now, the countries that have oil production as a major source of revenue and trade in dollars eg many N African countries, Venezuela have seen their economy completely stabilise and destroyed. These countries are sick of US and Saudi controlling the markets in a way that affects other countries adversely. Hence, for these countries, switching to the international trading system of a gold based currency will cause their economies to stabilise.

The international reserves of EU etc, on the other hand have seen increased holdings by the OPEC countries and have been worried of increasing power of these countries in the international banking system. They would be only to glad to get rid of these holdings.

Now, non Dollar currency would cause a fall in the US dollar value. In lieu of that, here is another thing that needs to be considered. A lot of the developing countries have international trade deficits. Now these trade deficits can be in the currency of the country to whom the debt is owed or any other internationally accepted currency eg. the Dollar. If the debt is in dollars, the conversions and interest rates of borrowing are determined according to the rules of the US treasury. Again, the rates in the US treasury are linked to the value of dollar. Most countries giving out loans prefer to do so in dollars as historically the Dollar is strong and trusted not to collapse and hence the money they owe is safe. The countries taking loans also convert their debts to dollars as it is easier and the country to whom the debt is owed cannot just up and change the value of the debt owed by manipulating their currency as dollar has determined the conversion into other currencies at fixed rates, so it is safe for everyone. However, there is a slight problem with this. If you owe a debt of 1 dollar to someone, when you pay the debt, it will depend on the value of dollar to your currency at that particular instant. So if dollar has gotten stronger wrt to your currency, you shall have to pay more money and if the dollar has gotten weaker, you will owe less money in your currency. Hence the fall of the dollar would be beneficial for the countries who owe debt in dollars and bad for the countries who have loaned out debt in dollars.

Also, taking debt in dollars becomes cheaper if the value of dollar falls since the US treasury interest rates are directly tied to dollars, hence it becomes cheaper to borrow in dollars. Also, as I said, if it grows weaker still, yo will owe less money.

One more thing to consider regarding fall of the Dollar is this. Uptil now, the oil producers have been buying US treasury bonds due to the Bretton Woods deal. Other countries and US and other corporations do so too. Now, the US treasury gives a fixed rate of interest to those investing in the treasury. This rate, in turn is linked to the value of the dollar. Stronger the dollar, more the interest on US Treasury bonds and more the foreign countries invest in it. Now this means that these foreign countries would much rather invest their money in US Treasury at an assured fixed rate of interest than invest it in 3rd world countries and take a risk of maybe losing it. However, if the value of dollar were to fall, the countries would much rather draw out of the US treasury and invest more in the startups in different countries, domestically etc.

The other side of the same coin would be the countries dependent on US investment. Should the value of the dollar fall, the investment being received from the US would be of a lesser value.

On the other hand, there is one more thinh. Like I said, investments in dollars are governed by the US treasury rules. Now, basically, US banks have cut the taxes on money transfer and conversion, artificially keeping them very low to fuel the domestic and world trade etc . If the dollar were to collapse, people wouldn’t trade in dollars. They would trade in other currencies. The inetrbanking across the world would be then governed by the rules of the currency you trade in, for eg, BRICS nations will follow the tariffs etc of the Shanghai Bank where most of the reserves are held. So that effect would then depend on the rules of the bank you deal with and that can be detrimental or beneficial depending on the bank’s policies compared to the dollar.

Also, countries having holdings in the US treasury would lose the entire value of their foreign reserves. On the other hand coountries like BRICS who have their reserves in other international banks would retain the value of their foreign reserves in those banks.

What does this mean?

Indian Currency would also fall with the fall of the dollar in its current state. Now, we usually run around with the perception that Indian currency is backed by gold, That’s not true. The truth is 99% of today’s currencies US Dollar, Euro, Indian rupee, all of them are fiat currencies i.e. their value is not determined by the gold they hold but by the economic strength of the government. Only an average of 4–7% of any country’s currency is today, backed by gold. US Dollar - 4.5%, Indian rupee - 5%. The rest is held in the terms of foreign reserves in other countries like in the form of US Dollar (around 70%) in US treasury bonds, in world bank or IMF, in other currencies (around 25%) in BRICS and other foreign reserves etc. Currently if you have rs 1000 , only rs 50 is gold, around 670 is held in the form of US dollars and Rs 280 in other currencies. You might ask why is that? Well, remember the Bretton Woods agreement. At that time US had 75% of the world’s gold which backed dollar and dollar backed other currencies so most of the currency of any country was backed directly or indirectly through dollar by gold. Now, it is difficult to keep gold in your country so it was convenient for other countries to just hold foreign reserves in dollars especially with the fixed exchange rates they provided. Hence more and more portion of their currency was being held in dollars. However, after Nixon shock of 1971, dollar removed its gold backing. So, automatically all other currencies that were backed by dollar (99% of the world currencies) also became fiat currencies as a result. However, the dollar was still good and trusted so no one thought much of it, especially since dollars were being printed out of thin air. However, now with the prospect of the trust in dollar fading, this as started to worry some experts. Because of the senseless printing of dollars and in exchange all the fiat currencies, the total amount of currency can nowhere near be compensated by the gold reserves even if all the gold in the world was put together. It would form not more than 10% of the currency in the world. Now, putting this disturbing detail aside, if Dollar were to collapse, 670 rupees of your 1000 would become worthless, too. So, it isn’t wise to hold US dollars, is it? No its, not and many countries have woken up to that fact.

China has been secretly amassing large amounts of gold. OPEC countries have started removing their capital from US treasury. See, these oil producers have been receiving US gold in exchange for trading oil in US dollars and have accumulated holdings in other countries’ treasuries. Now with all the crazy gold they have received they have bought material assets like real estate etc even in other countries. Now, they can simply sell out their US treasury bonds and buy more assets such as gold and real estate from it, which they have been doing in the recent years. Now, this will start depleting the treasury and cause the fall in the value of the dollar in turn causing other countries to withdraw and invest elsewhere. That, coupled with Russia and China doing trade in Roubles and Yuan, India and Iraq trading oil outside of dollar, Germany and China trading outside of Dollar, the strenghtening of BRICS bank etc, Dollar has been showing a steady decline. So India should also wisen up and start replenishing its treasury with gold and sell off holdings in dollars and euros and invest in other currencies on the rise. This is one reason BRICS could be very important for India and other countries in BRICS whether we like it or not. 

Another thing that using another currency would do, it would take away the power of the US to slap economic sanctions on whichever country they choose. This is one of the major reasons Putin has teamed up with China - in order to bypass US sanctions.

*[Edit: The thing that worries most nations is this - having international trade and foreign reserves in dollars gives US a single handed say on their economies. Just like Nixon's unilateral decision changed the fate of all currencies, other decisions by it can also change their economies. US can dictate their rules and if you don't follow them - sanctions. So the countries want to take back the power of making decisions in their own hands.*

*Next, the petrodollar is based on a commodity that is being depleted. Oil reserves are declining and the world is moving towards other sources - gree energy, nuclear energy etc. So the petrodollar decline is destined. However, what would US do next? They could shift to backing their currency with nuclear reserves or some new crazy idea out of someone's hat. That will, inevitably affect all other countries and they want to and should have a say in it.]*

On the other hand, China's attempt to start a gold backed currency may not pan out because like I said all the gold in the world is not sufficient to back all the currencies in the world. Also, since most currencies still have a large amount of dollar backing, fall of the dollar would make that percent of the currency valueless and therefore even having a reserve in another foreign currency could still cause a fall in Indian currency though it might be a little mitigated. On the other hand, fiat currencies are run by the investors' trust in the currency. So even if the dollar falls, a fiat currency with foreign reserves in the dollar may not fall because the confidence in that currency is still high. Sadly, such a currency would be Chinese Yuan. So, the policy to fix this? I am still trying to work on that solution. This is a post in evolution. My thoughts on this are still in evolution and I would really like some economists to come and hold a serious, well informed and sane discussion on this.

 I will add more when other points occur to me or are brought forward to me in any online or offline discussions.

I am yet to check out the links by some other users and I shall update the post with the links when I do.",concernadian," Very well written and informative article. Here important points to note:

1. China is trying hard to break the hegemony of dollar and taking every steps to convince other countries that Chinese currency is next best alternative to dollar given the turmoil in Europe

2. OPEC countries have reduced the prices of oil because they want all shale petroleum producers to go out of business as it is still expensive. US being major producer of shale petroleum will be hit by this. This might result in greater tussle between US and OPEC countries in coming years.

Despite all this US dollar will remain the back up currency for all nations for another 25 years until a group of nations like BRICS start a unified currency. But chances of this happening is very bleak at this stage. 
 Buy bitcoin, better yet buy monero That's a good write up. I've long called the petrodollar an incorrect term, it is better to call it the MilitaryDollar or NuclearDollar. As long as the US has more weapons and military strength than the next 20 countries combined there's no long term threat to the dollar. The medium of trust may shift from gold to oil to crypto currency or something else but, barring a couple of years of confusion,  the world will always come back to the US.

 OP, this is brilliant Also watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djwPqAJ_3GY *US currency is basically a petrodollar.*

I think this is an overstatement. Global trade in crude oil is just $700 billion while total global merchandise trade is $17,000 billion. So oil is just 4% of total trade. Even if oil exporters were to switch to some other currency, the impact on the dollar would be insignificant. Pricing oil in dollar may have initiated the rise of dollar but it cannot cause the decline in dollar.   

*Dollar has been showing a steady decline.*

Do you have any data to support your claim. Dollar index's value has been 96.5 in 2017 (based on monthly data). Compared to last 5, 10 and 15 year averages of 91.0, 85.1 and 85.8, respectively, the dollar index is higher by 6.0%, 14.2% and 12.8%, respectively. So dollar has actually been strengthening over the past 15 years. Really nice Article OP. It would be good if you can link some sources from where you got all the info. I had some questions though.

>This rate, in turn is linked to the value of the dollar. Stronger the dollar, more the interest on US Treasury bonds and more the foreign countries invest in it. Now this means that these foreign countries would much rather invest their money in US Treasury at an assured fixed rate of interest than invest it in 3rd world countries and take a risk of maybe losing it. However, if the value of dollar were to fall, the countries would much rather draw out of the US treasury and invest more in the startups in different countries, domestically etc.

Does this also not mean that the countries who have their investments already in form of bonds, will like to maintain the hegemony of USD?

>The other side of the same coin would be the countries dependent on US investment. Should the value of the dollar fall, the investment being received from the US would be of a lesser value.

Is this not basically the same side of the coin meaning that these countries too will be benefited in maintenance of status quo of Dollar. 

>The truth is 99% of today’s currencies US Dollar, Euro, Indian rupee, all of them are fiat currencies i.e. their value is not determined by the gold they hold but by the economic strength of the government.

By this what exactly do you mean? Assuming that all countries have equal foreign reserves in $ (Bad assumption, I know), why will the exchange value of Rupee with rate to let's say Euro change if USD goes down? Further does a change in foreign exchange rate will be a cause of trouble for countries which are a not a net importing country? Meaning that if today, a home made bread loaf costed 20 Yuan, won't it also cost almost 20 Yuan only, if the exchange rate of Yuan with Euro goes down?

   Damn it,guys,sorry for the long rant,Baccardi Limon is gold.

   Edit - statistic.
 
   Edit 2  -thanks for the gold kind stranger,it would have been great you know if you would have just up voted my post,and give that gold amount to some disabled folks in your vicinity,yes I have used the term 'disabled'.

   Now you may ask which disabled people you are talking about,I am talking about those who are most affected with this system of ours,for example while I was in my E-Resource of college there was this lady sweeping through the floor,you can literally see the broom movement expressing her grief and her dis-interest,at that time I was on some thread on this sub reading a comment by some guy on how worse is the situation of the lower rung class of the economy the workers.
   
   I thought why not just take a Rs 10 out of my purse and hand it to her,I know the amount was not big,but that's the best I could have done since I was running short of money as well,meanwhile the old lady just burst out with tears,its like she was going through a anxiety drive in her mind and suddenly this gesture of mine struck hard on her she took the Rs 10 note and said how bad the situation was for her that the college management gave her the month salary of mere Rs 1500 and that too on Rs 500 notes,the expression with which she told me sent a shiver down my spine,I was in existential crisis for a span,so much we have as a humans,so much tech,with the given advancements,the basic necessities for every individual of the earth can be covered,I started questioning the universe,how a Rs 10 note is a gram worth of weed for me but a vital sum for the under-privileged.
   
   the gold will provide me with me with less ads,better themes and shit-ton of other features,but the same amount will fill the light in some low rung homes,I am not trying to criticize this good gesture of yours but it would be cool if you find some under-privileged folk and provide them with necessities worth the gold,I can manage with ads and white theme,just my 2cents.

What does this have anything to with us being a Banana Republic?  > Where Sonny Leone is more famous than Sergio Leone

You've gone too far You've said it like it is, OP. Our country looks pretty fucked up, down and sideways. I agree with you on what you've said about our situation here, but, you know, every country has their fair share of problems. Sure, we might just be at the deeper end of the pond, but crying about it isn't really gonna help much, is it. I get that we need to take a second to vent sometimes, but it doesn't really help, imo, and it's all most of us tend to do. The thing is, i think we're just stuck right now in this weird limbo because of the crazy technological and cultural gap that's come about between the last few generations.

I really think we have a lot of potential in this country to get places. It's just that peoples' mindsets have gotta change a little. If we start thinking together as a country, to get our shit together and start doing stuff for our collective good, i think we could do some crazy stuff, bro. The every-man-for-himself-ness has gotta go away. To everyone harping about us becoming a banana republic... The definition of banana republic for your reference: ""a small state that is politically unstable as a result of the domination of its economy by a single export controlled by foreign capital""

I have a very simple solution.  We live in a democracy.  So if you want the system to change, you have the power.  If you can't change it, either accept it or get out.  Stop giving bullshit analysis and coming to incorrect conclusions.  >Where there are no passport centers in TIER II cities and you have to visit the near capital as well as pay a bribe to get a passport which will take a Bureaucratic unit of time to get processed and then you have receive it post office with again a bribe.

 
Im not sure about other states but here in Telangana, there are Passport seva kendras (PSKs) even in tier III cities as well (Nizamabad and Karimnagar for example). Where educated people (like OP) can't break down a problem (his/her list) into root causes & the only adjective used to describe the scale of the problem is ""biizzare"" OP forgot few more though...

Where stars gets all adulation /money and become superstars because of majority but when get caught or have trouble bring up the religion card or intolerance.


Where people self proclaim themselves as secular and still don't do anything to uplift minorities but just keep them as vote banks.

Where people cry about freedom of speech loudly but doesn't allow a single bit of criticism of themselves.


Where certain people are kept in God mode even though millions of corruption happened under their nose.


Where certain politicians just throw accusations but never feel the need to prove anything as their bhakts never believe anything against them.

Where feeling proud for certain religion is treated as treason just because it's majority.


Where all the corruption will suddenly vanish if you aligned with certain uncorrptibles.


Where JNU unkils proclaim themselves as intellectuls and smarter than common man.

Where 50 year olds declare themselves as youth icons and bhkaths blindly believe them.

Where you can order police to search for your lost buffaloes.




PS: how the hell people type so much ? You are Tyler Durden of me. Ours is also a country where Prison is not a ""for profit"" institution, where health insurance is not mandatory and people can still afford healthcare. It is also a country where student loans are cheap and you can get a degree if you toil. It is also the country where women have the full and final say on abortion. A country where people do agree on things like Pappu isn't leadership material. A country where people don't love their guns more than their neighbors. Its also a country where democracy is alive and kicking.

What we may need to do is think about putting country before our own interests. However bleak the reality may appear the endeavor to make things better for one and all should be greater than anything. 

Paradise is a myth.  Grass will always appear greener on the other side. You can not sort issues in your own house by focusing on someone else's household. 

Karmanevaya vishwasrastu na faleshu kadaachanam!! You got this all from Bac Limon? Dude...you should now start doing Bagpiper Whiskey.You'd have more stuff to write in the future days. It's not bizarre. The word you are looking for is Kafkaesque.

You know what OP. A lot of what you have mentioned has stopped bugging me over the years. What really gets me though is the way we treat the most downtrodden and the least fortunate ones in our society. It's as if we are forgetting about them with each passing day.

The raddiwalah who used to pick newspapers from our house is jobless and earning his living through begging from people he knows. He sent his daughter to the best school in the city but alas with all the demonetization crap he really can't afford it now. The girl's schooling will go on with other's mercy. A small businessman I know can't pay his employees. Yet, our prime minister did something. Our supreme court thinks he is not culpable and passes orders which will make us more patriotic.

You just proved it. Should not have read it at this hour. Bc coming to NSP Metro station this morning,I felt so disgusted. This is one of the posh areas of Delhi and all I could see between metro and my office was shit on the footpath, wrappers on roadside, people sleeping on the road, the road that has not been repaired since the eternity, and that Chhola Bhatura man who never gets a dustbin for his stall.

You might get mugged on the street or killed by a gang.  Baap re baap, din baar bas rant hi karte rahena. Kya roondu sub hai yei.  Hey man, you forgot to add that we love to bash our country every chance we get.  Please add a scheduled tag. It's the weekly India Is Doomed-thread.  Poppycock.
a) you stop consuming the lowest common denominator fare entertainment, you cannot expect the society to change per your whim.
b) justification of terrorists' hanging is NOT logical journalism, although the national anthem fiasco has been much ado over nothing. These days Anti Hindu is dangerously quickly construed as Anti national. Again, stop consuming this type of news and it will eventually go away.
c) this may come as a surprise, but the PM never operates alone, even though that might be the image projected onto us. About the currency ban, there's a Pune group called Arthashastra who have been the ideators for the whole thing. Their interviews are available in the public domain. Also, the reason you and i don't have cash in our wallets is because people are diverting truckloads before they hit the ATMs, as is again on the news every day. Honestly, up until the whole demonetization thing, India was doing perhaps the best both socially and economically amongst major countries. The West is in turmoil right now, especially the US. You know there's something going wrong in the US when folks can't even bother getting out to vote against probably one of the worst candidates of all time. On the other hand, at least Indians are taking their democracy and their politics seriously.  Well, China had all these problems you stated (and more) and they addressed this by having a different political structure. Do you want that in India ?

My experience with the answers of Quora on Government,63,749dxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/749dxv/my_experience_with_the_answers_of_quora_on/,29,"Before 2014 I was a daily user of quora but once they started there selfless work of promoting government for each and everything and when the crowd of wannabe top writer started throwing senseless answers on stupid question after taking weed. I was forced to quit. But I didn't unsubscribe from Quora digest.

Every alternate week I see there is a question on work related to government in Quora digest. And despite knowing what kind of answer it is going to have 7 out of 10 times, I try to read that. 
I have seen it all from giving them a little bit of time to proving how good demonetization was. 

There is usually a pattern in answers if the question is normal one like, how Modi is performing in his constituency then typically top response have this pattern. 
First, he will put a discloser why he eligible for giving this answer it could be, the writer himself belongs to the same constituency to he visited this place twice, one before 2014 and one after 2014. After that discloser,  couple of pictures from Varanasi in the night from the perfect angle where you can't see the filth. And with that, he will assure you that   Varanasi is literally transformed into a world-class city. Despite the well-known fact that Varanasi is not just restricted to Ghats of Ganga rest of the answer will focus on that, and there will be a rosy picture in front of you. The list put in front of you will mostly a daily news article like Modi gave a gift of x crore to Varanasi and there was a project that started only by great leader etc. Now, what would you expect from a guy who lives there is to put a picture of how his life is changed like electricity, roads and healthcare facility, he is getting after 2014, but no I will throw every random project news about Varanasi without the follow up on that project. Are bahi! ager news article ki project started or gifted vali news headline hi padhni thi to question kyu puchta. 

Another instance if the question is about the health of the economy or something like demonetization. Where people are vocal means, there is less excuse to make. Then ignoring all the facts on how government changed his stance from the attack on black money to increasing cashless transaction. The writer will simply put forward his own theory or a new theory produced by Sir Sambit Patra. One of the theory was now the government have a big database of people who submitted their money it will be easy peasy Japanesey to find defaulters. In the end, there will be some statement from hotshot banking firm head backing their theory and proving how India is headed toward glorious future. Despite the well-known fact how crores of money renewed through bank staff as well as through traveling agencies, daily wage workers, and jan dhan account.  

There are some instances where they pull legs on failed policies like make in India and poor river health but don't know how they forget the name of our beloved PM and his party in that answer. It's all about how bad Indian citizen then. If river Ganga is still filthy then only people are responsible about that because they throw religious material in it. But they closed eyes when Mr. Modi along with his fellas dropped religious stuff in the river during the live telecast of Narmada dam inauguration. 

Justification on how it is just cow cow and cow everywhere is simply it is not new, and it is going on from ages. It was Nehru who started all this. And our beloved leader is so good he never question his elders work. Then why would he question work of Chacha Nehru? He is just following his footstep.

Justification on why farmers are dying and rape is a big problem is again it is not new, and the X country is actually a top-ranked country in this. Just don't dare to question our leader.
One of the top writer and flag bearer of Indian diaspora on Quora said something amazing when asked why they act like the lawyer of government. 

> For the same reason Sachin, Steve Jobs and a variety of people are staunchly defended by their fans. You might not have agreed with every one of Sachin’s shots [especially the silly shots he got out] but would desert him for that?
Modi was elected by crores of voters. Some of these might have voted because they thought there is no alternative. But, there is a sizeable chunk of voters who voted because they believed. They believe this government is theirs and not some random entity like we have often behaved in the past.
If you assume Modi’s string of victories in state elections is a fluke and that a sizeable chunk of people don’t truly adore him, you don’t understand the evolving Indian politics.
In a way this is democracy - where people feel ownership in the government. Look at US politics and the same happens - where common people feel ownership and stake in politics and fight for their ideology.
When you believe it is yours, you will fight for it. 

Yeah, I will fight for it, and I will fight for every single penny I gave through tax and different types of cess. And question government why things don't change instead of supporting them for each and every idiotic move.",calvinwalterson," Question: Has India changed under Modi?

Answer: A BIG YES!

<insert random tweets made to govt>

JAI HIND! Quora is the best example of how education is useless without proper character or mindset.
  I was an avid Quora user till early 2016.


I used to be there for the vast amount of sensible answers on topics related to movies, science, tech etc.. Since I joined Quora around 2012, I had subscribed to the topic related to India, its politics and all. Gradually over the years, the indian population started sky rocketing. It turned into basically a facebook feed with pointless questions whose answers could be googled or despo ques by indian men. 

Post 2014, I noticed a tremendous shift in the type of questions, it was Modi everywhere. In the nascent stages of the government even I fell for the develeopment charade they were parading and many of the answers made sense. Little did I realise that the PR machinery was in full swing. Once the honeymoon period got over, you could see the cracks opening up. From the hike in railway fares to LPG to Petrol to Violence to Center trying to powergrab state assemblies, one by one the problems became visible.


This was the time Quora turned toxic for me. Literally every other question was about modi, 100s of answers on how he ate for 1 hour, slept for 3 hours blah blah started popping up. Most of it were utter bullshit. Side by side there were rumours that the BJP IT cell is in full swing trying to push propoganda on social media. With no options left, I muted all Indian topics and by mid 2016 left Quora for Reddit. 


Now after almost a year I went back. There are new players in town. The flag bearer of the Indian diaspora is being questioned on his pro-government answers. People are beginning to react back. Many top Indian writers who were fanboys of Modi are now seriously critiquing the government's policy blunders. The tides are slowly turning.


Not just Quora but I can see the same happening on FB too. Comment sections of newpapers are now pretty critical of the government. I know that this doesn't represent the entire country but I hope to God it does and the BJP starts to pay for its ignorance and ego.

I've said it then, I'll say it now. BJP won by a landslide not because the people loved BJP, they hated Congress after the scandals and policy paralysis of this decade and voted for Modi. You'll never know when the middle class and farmer swing votes will go the other direction.  Pre-2014 quota was great Quora has been invaded by the BJP/Modi PR army.

But don't worry. Have faith in ignorant Indians. Most educated voters don't take active interest in politics.  Man, Quora has been long before turned into a shitty forum filled with paid(most probably, because their IT cell is famous for this) pro-Modi army. Except reddit india, I haven't found a single forum on the internet that's not creeping with huge number of abusive right wing trolls since Modi has come to power. and I've heard stories about this forum as well. 

All those pro-government answers get like thousands of upvotes faster than the speed of light. My Quora digest was always composed of the people singing songs on the greatness of God's creation that is Narendra Damodardas Modi. I've stopped using that garbage dump since then. Balaji Vishwanathan(He is grade 1 a-hole celebrity on Quora, who knows nothing but praise BJP 24/7,hence highly popular and he's all numb since RBI figures came out after Demo), a few IAS officers and bunch of other popular accounts are all BJP inclined. A large no of random accounts keep posting pro-government propaganda and get huge no of upvotes despite their answer having NO substance or logic at all, including those having no followers and popularity. They are a part of Modi's PR machinery. Afterall this is the only thing he's good at. [removed] Please quora users leave reddit I was a lurker in quora, mostly adding it as search term along with my google queries. Used to get sensible answers, then I noticed the spamming. Everyone is copying answers, no curation involved, it was shameless. Promotions and copies and efforts to show off smartness in fields they clearly aren't. Cancer + Cancer = Quora One's Quora feed is the result of one's interest, upvote etc. Basically the topic you read more will appear more on your feed. That's how the algorithm works. If it bothers you just mute the topic ""India"". Problem solved. It works for me pretty well. ",Policy/Economy,2017-10-05 00:42:39

What grounds do your lawyer friends have? Did they copy and pass their law exams? Or are they filing cases under the (reasonably valid) assumption that Indian judges don't really care that much about the law?

 In before OP gets Vyapamed! That username, though.  This is all a farce man, I mean they'll mock it off.

 >>My lawyer friends are also considering filing a case against the govt for allowing old notes from party funds and not taxing them. Any advice?

Yes, please also file a case against the govt for allowing old notes from farmers and not taxing them. Normally I am against spam but I think in this case more people should be emailing them the same thing. Fucking crooked politicians Bhaiyya ji, it is all right to want to go after people with blackmoney but please don't indulge in shoot and scoot politics.

If you have credible investigatable evidence against someone, report him, file a case, whatever. Otherwise you are just spamming, wasting the time of courts on stupid things. Think of what you are doing, what you can do yada yada yada. JNU unkils thinks spamming a mailbox if will lead to revolution...lmao....lmao....lmao...,lmao..... Go ahead man.  Yeah Amit Shah shits clean chits intead of excrement, though. Do it. Time for ""surgical strike"" into accounts of political parties & the RBI by citizens of India

 Playing the devil's advocate here but wouldn't the black money hoarders will just send as many names as they can to stall investigation.  https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1554173/ Any organization that is arranging to file cases against the relief to political parties on depositing unlimited cash? 1- Your lawyer friends are stupid.

2- Not taxing does not not being asked to file return.

3 - Returns still need to be filed.

4 - This is exactly what AAP(NGOs, Temples, Churches, Mosques) do, they take SOME white money in donation, they put up a list. Then mix that white money into illegal money and delete the list from their website.

5- Still AAP has to file a return, in which they show all the money was white can use fake bills.



6 - If your lawyer friends are not stupid, ask them to file a case against in supreme court.

  6.1 What the case should be for?
        If X amount of money donated to the NGO/temple/church/mosque/Party is from bank accounts, with receipts, with source name's PAN card, then the NGO/temple/mosque/church can only and exactly show X amount of spending.


     6.2 If the spending about to  more than X+1 amount of money, then there should be serious probing against the NGO/mosque/temple/church/party.



I doubt the supreme court will understand this, given the kind of stupid and corrupt system they have for electing the judges.

I fully supported demonetization when it happened but now it has started to feel like a scam!,108,5hp22k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5hp22k/i_fully_supported_demonetization_when_it_happened/,156,"I'm not affiliated to any polarizing ideology of the sides that are fighting a tug of war now. But here are my observations so far. These are just my opinion and experiences and may not represent the whole situation accurately

* On Nov 8^th I was pretty happy that the government did it, as I was naive to the whole economy thing I thought it was an ingenious idea to get rid of all the black money

* I was still resistant after a week when 30+ uncles started complaining (note: these were the same uncles & aunties that praised Modi up and down on 9/11 and so did I as a matter of fact )

* Even after 3 weeks i wasn't affected as i was able to withdraw 2000 and 2500 on different occasions quite easily (funny stories btw, first time i walked in to a random ATM where i saw a bunch of people doing something to the ATM machine, i just stood in front of the door and was watching what they were doing, after couple of minutes they looked at me and made a gesture to come in, and when i went the guy in Khaki(idk if he was police) told me i can draw cash now, I proceeded and gave the amount as 400, the Gurkha looked at me weirdly and said the limit was 2000, I couldn't process at the moment what he was saying and thought may be only 2000's notes were there. So i reentered the amount as 2000 and drew a stack of 20 100s! as i turned back i saw a huge ass mob outside the ATM! with people still running towards it as i was heading out of the area! )

* But then afterwards I started thinking if black money was actually eradicated? Then it dawned on me, **This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!**

* Think about it. Most of the taxes come from the working middle class people in our country. Now from this move a bunch of poor people have been included to the tax roster, let's be honest, the rich have already been avoiding taxes very intelligently and they wouldn't shell out a paisa no matter how the rules get stricter. Thanks to all the private CA guys who never  made it.

* Then modi announced about releasing records of transactions from his party members **After** 8/11. **BUT** , wouldn't they have already took measures Before 8/11... if we want to be honest here, we should check on ALL politician transactions at least five years prior to this.

* What about black money in the form of foreign currencies? To the uninformed people, Switzerland is NOT the only tax haven in the world, so who ever did have swiss accounts, would've probably switched to somewhere else. So we're not getting that money either.

* All this whole fiasco did was, bringing bunch of poor people in to Tax radar, But they earn so less, we can't actually tax them.

* But i do have a proposal though, we can efficiently use the tax money and skyrocket india's progress, but the people of india needs to involve with the policy making at the root level like people of denmark and some other baltic states do. All we have to do is to have a system where the government still collects taxes but is unable to use the money without the tax payers approval and should give them details for every paisa used.

* people should be given the power of choosing where their tax money is invested into, A nice swimming pool for a minister's residence?: Not gonna give my money.  A public toilet and a public high rise parking lot?: Shut up and take our money.

* But how would we the ^^busy people keep involved in all these process? Well, just like wester countries have Jury duties , india should have a taxer duty, where a group of people are selected from the people investing in a project and are sent to negotiate the process, these people should be non-government citizens and nobody gets to go twice from the same group or similar duration. During that period the taxers should be given paid leaves from their jobs and shouldn't be deducted from their privileged accounts.

* I'm tired now and can't type anymore, but this is my argument. **demonetization was done to bring people under tax watch, but the people we needed in tax watch evaded it any way, this whole scenario was masqueraded as a fight against corruption, which won't stop, but we can smarten up now and demand accountability for our tax money before it gets devoured by our ridiculous politicians and the bureaucracy, because, INDIA!**

peace ",DemonRyuX," > 30+ uncles. 

That's where I got more hurt than whole demonetisation.  I'm pissing off the bhakts here, but Modi is your classic megalomaniac who's been out of touch for far too long. No one with $200,000 and half a brain stores their money in cash, and the IT Dept. is retarded enough they don't know the advanced money laundering methods. 

I talked to some people in the ATM lines and they still support the guy, I've even heard phrases like *ab dekho modiji kya karte hain!*, and still believe Modiji is going to deposit 15 lakh in their accounts. 

If you've ever wondered what living in a failed state looks like, Modiji is giving you that experience. Thanks Modiji for preparing us for the post-apocalyptic world!

All I know is, Kejriwal needs to step up his shit now. Congress has the people to counter BJP but it ain't gonna happen in 20 more years since Rahul won't give up his position. The opposition is up for grabs, no one is coming forward to grab it.  दूध का जला, छांच भी फुंक फुंक के पीता है!

I have been wary of all schemes launched by this govt. From the very beginning since i never drank the modi kool-aid.

This demonitization thing is swacch bharat 2.0. Looks good on paper...but when it comes to implementation, exposes the Govt. Machinery.
 That 8th November Announcement itself was a sham.There is a petition filed in the courts that the video of Modi wasn't even Live.It was Pre-recorded as you could see the video quality and the voice which sounds different than the voice in live feeds.So one could very easily doubt that the video was made before 8th of Nov.

Hence much of the chance and opportunity was give to those big wigs to save their asses.And the Media is quiet about this petition too,only National Dastak did show that news and the person who filed that petition.There was a press conference which was done in Press Club of India.

Edit :

[Found the Link,And that petition is filed by DD News Reporter](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=54OXSRsxTiA) As I've made clear in another thread, the biggest damage done isn't the next few quarters, but the long-term damage to India's image. Why would an investor setup a textile mill in India instead of Vietnam or Bangladesh when this kind of crazy shit is happening? Who knows what else the government might cook up because its addicted to a narrative of being ""bold"". 

Investors want long-term stability and a political leadership which is data-driven and competent. Demonetisation's biggest victim is India's reputation as an investment destination. Investment as a share of GDP has been declining for many quarters already and it won't get better in the aftermath of this clownshow. 

Most of the FDI we've seen has come in the form of equity and often in already existing businessness. Greenfield FDI into manufacturing, has been far more slower to materialise, and that's the kind of FDI which India desperately needs. And it isn't just FDI. Most investment comes from domestic sources. Banks and companies are already burdened with NPAs. This could worsen that situation as sales take a hit. 

People should look to the medium and longterm and be worried about that. The short-term hit, as bad as it is, will be overshadowed by the reputational damage done. To speak nothing of the employment losses in a situation where India is already struggling to generate enough jobs to the millions upon millions of new labour force entrants every year.  It's not just the rich that evade tax there are numerous traders who do the same. I don't get a bill for most cash payments. The change already affects huge black money deals as long the cash limit remains the same. >This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!

while I agree with you but I don't see what is wrong in bringing more people under tax radar.  Sure, there are many people who are poor but you are also underestimating the number of people who are capable of paying taxes and don't. 

For example - I have estimated that my milkman earns around 45k - 50k per month and I am pretty sure he doesn't pay taxes because he demands cash. He even offered me credit when I said I didn't have cash, but refused to take the cheque or netbanking option. 

How to bring such people under tax radar? Demonetisation may not be pretty and may even not be effective we have to wait for the numbers to see whether it has made a difference or not.  couldn't agree more. Initially, i though it was a brilliant and brave decision but people are dying, literally! 
As Raghuram Rajan himself put it, ""intelligent people will find their way around demonetization"" and that is exactly what's happening. next elections are going to be interesting!  number of income tax paying citizens is not going to increase too much. the poor don't have enough money to be taxed. the salaried class have been paying taxes all along. the businessmen and the rich will continue to avoid the taxes. there would be at most a marginal increase in income taxes. > This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with

The intention was to
 
* Target hoarded black money
* Remove fake notes from the market
* Stop terrorist funding, not just in Kashmir, but Nexals, Maoists etc.
* Issue lower amount of cash in market then it was existing before, thus creating cash crunch and force people to use digital (not everyone, but those who can..will)
* Bring everyone under tax radar, not for taxing them, but to get analytics correct for the next step, which is going to be the big one.
* UP Elections ;)
* Digital economy is must for GST and to succeed and remove poverty from India.
* Digital economy is must to reduce corruption in government offices as well as to reduce crime.
* This step was to close doors for the next bigger one, i.e. the black money in assets. Once the Benami Law is going to be used on large scale to unearth huge amount of hidden wealth, there will be no way to sell properties in 60-40. Unable to sell it they will have to let it go to the government or go to prison. This law is pretty strict and will not only punish the person who buys, but as well as the person on whose name it was bought. So imagine some big shot get caught and his son or daughter also go to prison because of his mistake. People collect wealth thinking even if they go to prison, their family will be rich. Here things will be different ;)
* Its fine if someone has stored wealth outside India, but government is trying to recover that too, it is elusive because we can't dictate terms on other countries, but we can identify whenever they try to bring that money to India and then we can royally screw them.
* The people have voting power already for 70 years, all they got was poverty. 
 This is the problem with ""the 1% is evil"" mentality people.
so you think black money is generated only by the super rich,and not by anyone else?
or do you want only the super-rich to fund the entire country while ""poor"" and middle class people don't pay tax,because ""it is gonna be looted by the Govt?
this sub doesn't disappoint Funnily enough, I was thinking of making a ""I don't understand the demonetization panic"" post (but decided otherwise because I had better things to do).

On Friday night, I went and stood in an ATM line for the first time since demonetization, just for the sake of it (other than a few hundred rupees for rickshaws over the past few months, I haven't needed cash). So anyway, I stood in line for two hours and was able to draw the money. It wasn't as painful of an experience as all these fucked up need channels are touting it to be and I didn't die in the process (or have a baby delivered or suffer a heart attack or any of that crap). The only problem was the dumbasses in the line who had come up with   rules of their own, and started fighting over them but I just chose to ignore them and calmly withdrew the cash. >This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!

>Think about it. Most of the taxes come from the working middle class people in our country

Most poor won't make it into the taxable bracket. 1% pays 99% of income tax. Widening the tax net is inextricably linked to combating black money. Untaxed black money by businesses turns into bribes for politicians and bureaucrats. And bringing more people under tax watch doesn't mean taxing the poor, there is 2.5 lakh individual income tax limit upto which there are 0 taxes. Even one slab above has nominal tax rate.  I don't understand.

How is bringing people into the tax net a BAD thing? 

I mean sure, some big fish will escape with the help of their CAs and other connections, and attempts are being made to bring them to book, but then that does not mean the move as a whole is bad. Is that ""denmark-ist "" taxing system practically possible in India?Has anyone explored that line of thinking?It seems more like UBI in the west which has no possible implementation in our country in near future. I disagree what do you mean by poor people have to pay tax? there are tax slabs and if your earnings are taxable, you aren't really poor. if everyone paid taxes honestly, we the service class won't be burdened by the low tax rebates. >But then afterwards I started thinking if black money was actually eradicated? Then it dawned on me, This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!

Why is this a bad thing? If you receive or use government services - like using a road or the railways or education schemes - you should pay your fair share of taxes. 

We often complain about 'stupid Indians' spitting or peeing and such on public property - when Indians universally start realizing they're the ones paying for it through their taxes (by making them actually pay taxes) that sort of thing will start to curb. If this decision stops riots in Kashmir and make people with attitude of  हमारे सात पूशते बैठके खाऐगे  worry, Then I am in for all of this.  Why should only people like me who withdraw salary from bank pay taxes. Make each one of us pay as per their earnings, why appeasement of certain classes >But then afterwards I started thinking if black money was actually eradicated? Then it dawned on me, This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!

Typical Indian mindset here. Tax nai bharna but wants the defence, research, public services to be well funded. Only 1% of Indians pay tax as of now. Its a ridiculous figure. If demonetization gets this 1% to even 5%, i think its a big big success. I would like the see the face of Manmohan Singh if govt successfully increases our tax base.  All of you critics of modi; repent and cleanse your accounts today.

Tomorrow the wheel *will* turn and he will correctly regain the initiative. Modi is one of the best politicians we have had in the past 20 years.

And then you will regret these excesses today.

Edit: downvote me all you like, but when the so called Bhakt army finds something to refocus on, it's going to be ugly.  As an ABCD, is this really as bad as you guys are saying? Or are you guys just bias af? Bunch of overreacting retards in this sub.Its been less than 2 months since demonetization, what the fuck did you guys expect? I'm neither anti or pro demonetization, i'll wait for a few months and then decide if this is a scam or not. It's not about money, it's about sending a message. 


Even if it doesn't work atleast people know govt is strict on corruption and its not the same as previous govt. India won't change overnight, neither will Indians. It's a journey .

That's just wishful thinking on most Indians part. Most foreigners just view India is just a larger version of Africa and Indonesia because they have a very large number of poor people \+ unemployed and that most elites know that it will usually lead to nowhere. Nothing more.

Even at that stage, China's economy will still be many times larger than India \+ they have A.I. and robots to deal with their economic/workforce slowdown/reduction\(so many articles on google and the web about how they are gonna dominate this industry\) unless something miraculous starts happening like India starts growing at 10&#37;\+\+\+ every year for 2\-3 decades and that's a huge IF.

>At this point though, India is large enough an economy that it starts taking over the mantle \>from China about Asian leadership. And genuinely rises in influence and power to be called a \>superpower. Do you see that happening? And which factors will actually hasten this process?

Most of India are still gonna be mired in poverty. Same situation as Africa and Indonesia right now. Ask yourself if the outside world have given them any respect despite growing their economic size without condoms or birth control? OK, maybe Indonesia have done more than Africa and India at this issue but my main gist of my argument still stands. The world only respects countries with either Oil, Strong Military, Huge Economy, Good Education, Advanced Technology and Infrastructure. China is leading or catching up quickly to the West and other first world countries in many of those aspects.

>Some dramatic changes in policy? Takeover from an authoritarian regime \(some would argue we're \>in one right now\)?

Maybe but it's gonna be very bloody. Unlike your average East Asians\(Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Koreans\) who tend to be very meek and subservient, South Asians generally wouldn't have a stand for it and will most likely ignite a civil war leading to the eventual fall of South Asia. The first question is why India wants to be a super power. Will it matter when we became super power still have poverty and unjust society? 
There is a lack of entrepreneurs in the manufacturing sector in India. People dont have any 'know how' of how to setup a manufacturing plant. 

Entrepreneurs in food sector are plenty, even a chhole kulche vala is an entrepreneur. If a person fails to do anything in India, they think food business is the best bet and thats true too because they do earn a living from it. But is it helping India's development, no!

Govt of India must focus more on EDPs, reducing tariff and non-tariff IT barriers, improving education quality, and improved financing system.

Only entrepreneurs make an economy self sufficient.

The day when India has produced enough entrepreneurs, that day we will achieve true independance.

Any interpretation or analysis by a journalist is good for garbage.

Anyway, I can't see that quote in the ET article you have linked to. Did you give an incorrect link accidentally or have they edited the article since?

Edit: Looks like incorrect link. You probably wanted to link to this article

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-gdp-growth-appears-solid-says-noted-us-economist/articleshow/57477617.cms I am not pro or anti modi on this issue, but has the informal economy ever been considered to talk about the status of Indian economy ? Were there years where the informal economy was doing better than what the GDP suggested ?  First two paragraphs:

> Noted American economist Steve H Hanke has said that India's economic growth for 2016-17 is appearing 'solid' because the GDP figures did not take into account adverse impact of demonetisation on informal economy. 


>""India's growth is only solid b/c it ignores the adverse effect of #demonetization on the massive informal economy,"" Hanke, an American applied economist at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, said in a tweet.

😂 Wasn't bringing the informal economy under the umbrella of the formal economy one of the objectives of demonetization? Informal economy used to be counted in GDP prior to demonetization? If not then why should it's impact be considered on GDP numbers now?  

Ideally demonetization's indirect impact should hopefully bring some part of informal economy in the formal economy. Why are you surpised? This is what Moditutes from Main Stream Modia do. Thanks for the observation. Its so commonplace these days that big corporations, institutions and world leaders just blabber some bullshit and people take their word for it and/or show complete lack of professionalism and/or intellect and somehow we just accept it. My understanding of informal economy is pretty limited, and goes like this. 

A guy buys a basket of mangoes for 500 Rs, and sells it in market for 800 Rs, rinse and repeat. Now due to demonetisation, his 500 Rs note is invalid, and he goes through hardship for a good part of two months, and now he has fresh currency, and goes back to the farm to buy mangoes, unfortunately, it is priced 700 Rs because the farmer wants to make back what he lost, and now this guy sells it for say 1000 Rs, rinse and repeat.

The informal economy died for a good 3 to 4 months and is back on. It will slowly adjust to the current demands of the market. People might shift fields, might have reduced income in some cases, but it will go back to its place once enough cash is available. Now that is my understanding of informal economy. 

Is that very far off from reality, please explain if so. 

Well, it was a shitty thing to do by the govt. People didn't need to suffer. The best way to measure the damage caused by it is to find out how many people died directly, how much mental suffering was caused by it(difficult to measure), I assume the latter to be a lot, and the former to be as close to zero as possible. But the govt clearly has no right to put its populace in such distress and will surely pay for it in the elections(or not, according to the pundits). 

What is the next course of action, that can be taken by people who are dissatisfied by it? To me, it seems like, since what's done is done, we need to predict how it is going to impact us, and do everything possible to prevent it from happening to us. Unfortunately, people don't want to punish them, but if we keep wasting our time shouting, looks like we won't have enough time to predict and prevent the disastrous consequences that are about to hit us. Waiting for the disasters to happen, so that we can say, I told you so, is not a viable option in this case, I believe, because it will affect us too. 

Truth will come out and punishment will be given in time. For now, the resources should be directed at predicting and finding ways to prevent it. 

That's my 2 cents as the saying goes.  I still haven't seen a comprehensive article that objectively analysis the long term affects of demonetization. It's all rhetorical jabs or opinions. Main stream media is really incompetent.  I think this is good..  its fine to grow the organized sector at the cost of the informal economy Doing your own research != Reading wikipedia You all should follow him on twitter, fun guy. do it now follow him although not all he says is true. also follow 5 other Economists on twitter it brings great knowledge and perspective to your life. But, in India, the informal sector is not considered as the part of GDP. The contribution is very less. Most people in rural areas are not part of the formal banking system. Whatever they sell(vegetables), are bought by someone who is also not a part of our economy.

We never considered them, so the adverse impact is also not considered. 

This demonetization will force them to use the formal banking system, so we can actually track down the informal business(90% employment). This informal sector also contributes to grassroots level corruption and inefficiency.",Policy/Economy,2017-03-06 02:18:49
Is import substitution the right policy for India?,1,9n6945,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9n6945/is_import_substitution_the_right_policy_for_india/,0,"## Against import substitution:

1. Almost all mainstream economics backed by World Bank, IMF is against Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI). So is the current opinion of India [economists](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/LsmVCb9m6adIvafTdQJ4vN/Opinion--Trade-liberalization-folly-From-high-road-to-low.html) on Modi's shift towards ISI.
2. Comparative Advantage: Basically do what you are good at and buy something for cheap if it is available for cheap in the international market. The entire specialization economy is based on outsourcing specialization. This argument says that if India is good at making spices then it should keep making spices, and if India is good at IT then it should keep doing IT. Let France make Rafaels etc.
3. Tariffs attract tariffs: If we put tariffs on other countries' products, they are going to retaliate and tariff our exports. We will suffer.
4. Corruption and local monopolies: Brazil's semi-conductor industry example and India's car industry example show that protectionism does not necessarily lead to rise of globally successful industries.

## For import substitution
The main arguments comes from Ha-Joon Chang in his book Bad Samaritans.

1. According to Ha-Joon Chang, both Britain and USA used protectionist trade policies during their period of rapid industrialization and when they had good stable industries, then decided to ""liberalize"" themselves and every one else. The same is true for South Korea, Japan and China.
2. Comparative Advantage theory by Riccardo is based on the assumptions of free-flow of labor and restricted-flow of capital. The current ""globalized"" word is opposite, the capital can flow freely while the labor is restricted by passsports and visas. Moreover, the comparative advantage theory does not take into account the long term human development like education and health that might result from development of local industry. This is equivalent of the idea that if you won't go to college and start driving Uber after high school, then you will always drive Uber because you have a ""comparative advantage"" in driving skills than others.
3. Tariffs arguments: I think this is a valid argument, but if China can do it, then India can too. The tariffs are a part of the diplomatic process, we should balance it with other diplomatic processes.

Does the government want to LOWER the tax net? This is such bullshit! Take my fucking money quietly and stop making it difficult for me to pay you.

 You live in the US, why do you feel obliged to pay taxes to the Indian Government? 

I live here and I don't like paying taxes, but.... let's just say I have to.

If govt. is making it hard for you to pay taxes because of ADHAR, then you should be happy. Stop filing those shit IT returns, pay taxes in the country you reside in. 

I ain't getting an ADHAR, so if the want tax but also adhar, they can very well fuck themselves around a tree. This is unacceptable. And it won't be implemented. I don't think you can get an aadhaar card even if you went to India. You have to be in the country for 182 days before you can apply. http://uidai.gov.in/images/aadhaar_enrolment_correction_form_version_2.1.pdf Tweet sushma swaraj What do you mean by mandatory? 
My PAN card name and Aadhar name won't match so I won't be able to submit the returns? 
OR they will remove the PAN card and move completely to Aadhar? Ever since Modi came to power, they have only focused on modifying Income Tax rules & tinkering with economic policies. All talk & no work on infrastructure, healthcare, education or preparation for Tokyo 2020 Olympics

I have Aadhar card & it turned out to be useless document. Applied for passport with Aadhar, PAN, Voter ID, savings bank a/c, 10^th passing cert, school leaving cert, IT assessment orders, etc & didn't get the passport... Application got stuck due to unable to bring proper witness for police verification. What's the point of having documents - esp. Aadhar? I had to stand whole time inside passport office (never got any seat) & deal with rude officers. Lost my Rs. 1500/- - I feel like getting scammed (for the first time in my life) despite having Aadhar card

It's really **frustrating** to do business in India due to [time-consuming & cumbersome approvals](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/licence-raj-replaced-by-time-consuming-approval-raj-biocon-cmd-kiran-mazumdar-shaw/articleshow/53490079.cms?from=mdr). Better gradually move your business within USA & file taxes to the IRS. 

Modi Govt is complicating things with extra paperwork creating bureaucracy & red tape. World Bank's 2017 [Ease of Doing Business](http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings) ranking proves that Avoided Aadhaar legally till now and now they come up with legal ways to declare all those who refuse to get into the Aadhaar fold anti-national. Wah Modi ji Wah. Especially when their stand was this just a few years ago https://imgur.com/a/2ZeMF

And we have a toothless Supreme Court, that continuously keeps saying you can't make Aadhaar mandatory and everyone keeps making it mandatory cooking up some link to 'benefit' availed from govt or the public exchequer.

If they really get this passed, moving out of the country will be the only option. I'm going to, if they did! The next time you come to India, get an aadhar. It took me a total of 2 hours for getting an aadhar with all documents. Or better tweet the indian embassy at where you live and maybe they can have one done there.

Ask your CA and stop relying on some news articles.

Stop whining and obey the laws of the country, if an aadhar is required, go ahead and get it. [People in the US get an SSN and other documents, similar wait periods/rules etc. exists, why the whining?] 

As a citizen, you are obligated to obey rules. You make money which is taxable in india, then better adhere to their rules. If not, then have your business elsewhere. What is so hard in understanding this?
 Maximum government, minimum governance. Ab ki baar, u turn sarkaar! Not only this they want me to fill new form this year 12BB.

The point is if govt want they can create a flat 15% tax slab and no other deduction. But no you can take 50K NPS , 1.5 lac in 80c , fuking LTA and fake medical bills. 


I know at least 100s of  people now who fake the rent receipt. 

Why govt is acting like a dumb ! Why can not they make things easy?

  If and only if you have an aadhaar card it's mandated to enter the number else you can leave it blank.  Don't worry. They will change the rules again in a couple of days. ;) WTF! 
I will have to file taxes too, and I will NEVER get Aadhar. Sorry sir, but I believe a single identification number for all Indians is long overdue. The US does not have a well integrated system with SSN, but other countries have very advanced single ID systems - benefiting residents and citizens . Using this number for tax payment, banking, employment, education and healthcare are steps in that direction.

Just like US citizens comply with the pay-tax-to-Uncle-Sam rule, just because they hold on to a passport that says 'United States of America' on the front and can open banking accounts in that country, you as an Indian citizen - have to comply with the taxation rules, or face consequences. ""Take my fucking money quietly"" is exactly what some corrupt officials have been doing previously. ""Stop making it difficult for me to pay you"" is exactly what a unique ID will allow the government to establish -- in the long run.

All this said, what I am *absolutely baffled by* is why did the government not just improve and extend PAN number (issue additional numbers) to the rest of the Indian population, as a unique identifier -- instead of creating a new Aadhar ID. Brother i totally feel for you. 
Aadhar is a new unique biometric for all indians and it has solved a lot of problems regarding documentation for a common man from land buying to jobs to buying a sim card to govt subsidies and i beleive it has rooted out major corruption issues. 

So let's say you have 10 bank accounts but govt doesn't know it coz banks dont share data amongst themselves, they make Aadhar number mandatory for all accs. You stop paying taxes and boom you are caught and cant escape it.  [deleted] I think the Indian problem is copying American systems. Thus we get American problems as well.

Demolishing Some LCA Tejas Falsehoods,533,4r5hgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4r5hgo/demolishing_some_lca_tejas_falsehoods/,121,"_""The Tejas is an old design. It has taken 32 long years to develop! And despite being in development for so long, it isn't truly indigenous. Its heart, the engine, is of foreign origin. So are its weapons and some avionics. Furthermore, it is so deficient in its performance, that the Indian Air Force (IAF) wants Rafales/Su-30MKIs/F-16s instead.""_

Every time the Tejas achieves some important milestone, these criticisms are repeated ad nauseum, in the popular media, on Twitter, on internet forums, and at bhel-puri stalls in Jhumritalaiyya. It's infuriating to see an effort of this magnitude, one that has produced [many successes](http://www.ibnlive.com/blogs/india/saurav-jha/the-radiance-of-tejas-a-bright-prospect-for-make-in-india-10879-748651.html), being panned time and again. So I've taken the liberty to put together this handy-dandy LCA Tejas mythbusting guide to counter them.

And without wasting your time any further, I'll jump right in.

**False Argument 1: The Tejas is ""late"". It has been under development for 32 years!**

The figure is technically true, but deprives the narrative of much-needed context. The Tejas’ origins can indeed be traced back to 1983, when the concept of a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) was conceived. However, the IAF did not finalise its air staff requirements (ASRs) until 1985 and initial funding did not come through until 1986. The project definition phase—the phase in which technical requirements are defined and a conceptual design prepared did not end until 1988. The final design was completed in 1990. Full funding was issued only in 1993, after which the development of a prototype commenced in earnest. See [this list of milestones](http://www.tejas.gov.in/history/milestones.html) for reference.

Following several years of delay in the development process—delays that can at least partly be traced back to overly optimistic R&D timeline projections, scope creep, and [US sanctions on India](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-05-31/news/39655783_1_drdo-chief-v-k-saraswat-lca-project) following the 1998 nuclear tests—the Tejas had its first flight in 2001. From then, the project proceeded at a pace that is not too different that of comparable fighter aircraft development programmes worldwide. It is slated to achieve final operational clearance (FOC), the stage at which an aircraft is considered fully ready for squadron service, in early 2017; fifteen years from the date of the first flight. At this time, the it is expected to be ready to carry out multiple functions: beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air combat, short-range dogfighting, and precision ground attack with a variety of guided and unguided weaponry.

That compares well with contemporary fourth-generation fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon and the JAS-39 Gripen. The first technology demonstrator of what would later be called the Typhoon first flew [in 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Eurofighter_Typhoon). The definitive version with an AESA radar is [still not in service today](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/euroradar-nears-flight-test-phase-for-captor-e-on-ty-416564/), 30 years down the line. The Tranche-2 version, which can drop precision bombs and fire BVR missiles, wasn't available [until 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm). Another European fighter, the Swedish Gripen-C, with full-spectrum capabilities, started entering service in 2002, also fourteen years after its first flight. 

The Tejas is about to FOC with all of these capabilities in late 2016. The fact that ADA managed to achieve similar or better timelines with the Tejas after its first flight, that too without the benefit of half a century of experience in building advanced fighters or the industrial ecosystem that enables such high-technology to proceed swiftly, is an achievement that is not given enough credit.

**False Argument 2: Because of the inordinate delays in development, the Tejas is now deficient.**

Just because the development was delayed doesn't mean that the design is the same one from 1983. The IAF updated its requirements quite often and kept demanding additional capabilities throughout the design and development phase. It was a Catch-22 situation: the constant change in requirements kept the design up-to-date, but it also led to several years of delays because of the need to re-design, re-test, and re-certify subsystems after every modification. Off the top of my head, I can remember that the IAF demanded the following modifications pretty late into the program:

* Open avionics architecture.
* Precision bombing capabilities.
* Heavier A2A missiles (R-73 vs R-60).
* Internal EW suite that included a self-protection jammer.
* Inflight refueling
* More capable radar and missiles (LCA Mk-1A)

With these modifications, the Tejas went from being a simple point-defence interceptor to a full-blown (albeit short-legged) multi-role fighter. 

**False Argument 3: The LCA falls short on several performance parameters like empty weight, range, turn rates, etc. The IAF has allowed 53 concessions/permanent waivers in the design.**

Like the 32-year delay, this too is a scary looking quote that paints a false picture of how fighter aircraft programmes work.

First off, it is important to remember that the Tejas can carry out most of the tasks intended of it quite competently. It can fight other aircraft at beyond visual range (when equipped with an AESA radar and Derby/Derby-ER missiles, it could end up becoming _the most capable_ BVR platform in IAF service). The addition of an Israeli helmet-mounted sight coupled to missiles whose seekers have a wide field of view (R-73 and Python IV/V) make it a fearsome dogfighter and compensate for minuscule shortfalls in aerodynamic performance. It can drop laser-guided bombs on ground targets with great precision. It is also very easy to fly. [In the words of the IAF](http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/air-force-drdo-pleased-with-tejas-performance-at-bahrain-116022200321_1.html), the fighter’s ""control harmony is comparable to the best in the world… The intuitive cockpit layout and highly reliable life support systems provide for comfort as well as excellent situational awareness."" There are many such triumphs; too many, in fact, to recount here.

Secondly, _every_ fighter project concludes with specifications that aren't met, or a few deficiencies in performance. It’s never that big of a roadblock to induction in service. And all said and done, 53 is a very small number as far as design concessions go; a pretty small portion of the entire range of capabilities. Even simpler aircraft (like the [C-17]( http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910528&slug=1285732)) enter service with more deficiencies. These are either compensated with using improvements in other areas to offset performance shortfalls, or accepted in the interest of availability for combat. 

Again, I shall go back to the Eurofighter Typhoon to illustrate my point. Remember I mentioned that it first flew in 1986? Twenty-two years later, it [couldn't independently drop a laser-guided bomb](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/01/eurofighter_austere_air_to_ground_what_joy/) on a target with any precision. Basic BVR combat capability was not available until Tranche 2 models were procured [in 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm), 14 years after the first flight. Even in close air combat, its capabilities were decidedly limited. The helmet mounted sight (HMS)—a system that allows the pilot to cue weapons onto an enemy aircraft by simply turning his head and offers a quantum jump in dogfighting capabilities—did not enter service [until 2010](https://www.eurofighter.com/about-us).

The F-35 was hobbled by similar issues (and terrible program management) [for several years](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/joint-strike-fighter-lockheed-martin). It didn't begin to turn a corner until 2012 or so, after which it began rapidly demonstrating some of the capabilities that were expected of it.

The companies running these projects were aero giants with decades of experience behind them. How then does one expect the ADA, which has never developed a fighter in its entire existence, to deliver a more capable product while experiencing fewer failures? 

Thirdly, the IAF itself works with deficient designs all the time. The Gnat and Su-7, both hobbled by short ranges and limited payloads, were procured in large numbers. The MiG-21, when initially inducted, was underwhelming. Its range was limited and its missiles didn't work. The Bison is still riddled with issues. The Jaguar had a deficient nav-attack suite. It was practically useless in the long range strike role until the IAF and HAL developed and implemented the [DARIN upgrades](https://tkstales.wordpress.com/2010/03/07/the-darin-story/). The MiG-27's navigation system [never performed satisfactorily](http://www.livefistdefence.com/2010/07/special-report-story-of-indias-mig-27.html), and its reliability was terrible. But none of this troubled the IAF. Why then is the LCA failing to achieve a handful design parameters something to raise a huge hue and cry about?


**False Argument 4(a): The LCA isn't really indigenous. Many of its subsystems are of foreign origin.**

But many more of its critical subsystems are of Indian origin too! The first one that comes to mind is the carbon-fibre composite airframe. It is a very high-end product that reduces weight (thus permitting the carriage of a substantial external payload), aids maintenance, brings down manufacturing time, and so on. The fact that some of the technology involved in its manufacture has been exported to Airbus is a testament to its success.

Another example is the digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system, developed from scratch by ADA scientists in India after their work, notes, and equipment was impounded by Lockheed Martin in 1998. No country on earth, not one, has developed such a complex system and gotten it to work perfectly on the first try. It works so well that when it was first tested on an F-16XL in the US (this was before the nuclear tests), it improved the test-bed's handling qualities in several flight regimes. There is a reason the Tejas' test pilots call the aircraft to fly.

There are many other examples. The avionics. The mission computers. The navigation equipment, displays, and human-machine interface. The EW systems. This stuff isn't trivial by any yardstick.

Now coming to the foreign components aboard the aircraft. With the exception of the Americans, and to an extent the Russians, _every_ country has used foreign subsystems extensively in its aircraft designs. The [Gripen](http://www.airframer.com/aircraft_detail.html?model=JAS_39_Gripen) has an American engine, a British airframe design, Swiss carbon-fibre, an Italian radar, an American flight control system, a cockpit with critical components purchased from Britain, and so on. This in spite of the Swedes having an industrial base that is far more advanced than India's and extensive experience developing cold-war fighters such as the Draken and Gripen. The Rafale and Typhoon both use American ejection seats. Their flight control system uses actuators from Moog, an American company. The Russians were buying [Damocles pods](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/russian-fighters-to-use-thales-damocles-targeting-pods-220747/) for the Su-35s before the French stopped military exports after they invaded Crimea. Nearly every Chinese fighter in service today uses a Russian engine, a Russian ejection seat, and a slew of Russian weaponry. If these aircraft all qualify as ""indigenous"", then surely the Tejas does too?

The choice that Indian design agencies faced was quite stark: should they have tried to build every little component in-house, thus reinventing the wheel at every step? Or used technologies/sub-systems available easily in the market in the initial stages and then made an attempt to indigenise over the life-cycle of the product? It's obvious that the latter was the more sensible path to take.

In the final analysis, the Tejas is an aircraft that has been designed by Indians in India, and is tailored to Indian requirements. If that doesn't make it indigenous, I don't know what does.
	

**False Argument 4(b): Okay, I get that. But the aircraft's very heart, its engine, is fully imported! Surely it's an utter failure on that front?**

Yes and no. It has had a very protracted development cycle, and for good reason. A jet engine is arguably represents the pinnacle of modern technology, making it the most challenging system in the world to develop from scratch. It has to produce ungodly amounts of power for its size and operate at the very edge of what physics allows. The GE F404—which ended up replacing the Kaveri on the LCA—weighs just a shade over 1000 kg and develops close to 80 kN of wet thrust. Assuming that it propels the LCA to Mach 0.9 at sea level (1,100 km/h), it's developing about 24,400 kW or 32,700 hp. That's 32 hp per kg. In contrast, a Formula-1 car engine generates ""only"" 8 or 9 hp per kg, and it's about as far as one can get with piston engines.

What does it take to generate so much power? One needs critical components like turbine blade assemblies that see inlet temperatures of 1,400°C or so while being subject to extreme forces. A back-of-the envelope calculation using rectally extracted figures tells me that a single high pressure turbine blade weighing 50 gm, and rotating at 16,000 RPM at the end of a 500 mm diameter disk, will be subject to a centrifugal force of about 3,500 kgf. Imagine two Honda Civics hanging off a tiny blade that is about as large as two of your fingers held together. There is a transverse load component as well; the 80 kN of thrust is distributed over the turbine blades. 

In order to sustain such loads, exotic materials and precision manufacturing techniques are required. Steel melts at about 1400°C, and starts rapidly losing strength at less than 500°C, so it's obviously not an option. Modern engines instead use nickel-based superalloys. Moreover, the material can't simply be cast or forged or machined into shape. The blade has to be produced via directional solidification or grown out of a single crystal in what looks more like a lab than a production shop. The shape, too, is very intricate. There are internal channels that route cold air taken from the compressor to the surface of the blade to keep it cool.

The fan, compressor, combustor, gearbox assemblies, bearings ... they're just as complex. And they all have to be precision manufactured to ensure that microscopic imbalances don't end up leading to excessive vibrations that could end up destroying the engine and the aircraft while in flight. Then there are requirements like safety, fuel efficiency, minimum total technical life, and reliability that add multiple layers of complexity to the design.

Now imagine the magnitude of effort required to develop something like this, with practically zero infrastructure and very little in terms of  a pre-existing knowledge base. And with skinflint bureaucrats refusing to approve requests for funding, test equipment, or manufacturing tools without documentation being submitted in triplicate and subject to audit after audit.

Now let us talk costs. The GTRE spent [Rs. 2,000 crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rs-2101-crore-spent-on-development-of-indigenous-kaveri-engine-heres-why-theres-been-a-delay/articleshow/48282481.cms), or approximately $640 million in equivalent US dollars (with all the exchange rate and inflation variations that happened between 1989 and now taken into account), on developing the Kaveri. This seems like a lot, until you see that advanced nations spend billions on such programmes, and they almost never develop clean-sheet designs. They are always building on existing knowledge and existing designs. 

[Jeff Immelt, the CEO of GE says](http://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-on-transforming-ge-2015-12), ""If you could make something with 60 people in a garage, GE shouldn't be doing it. But if you make a jet engine, there's only like one and a half people in the world that can make a jet engine. And we are really good at that. If you want to compete with that, you've got to put yourself on a wayback machine and go back 25 years and invest $1 billion here for 25 years and then _maybe, just maybe_ [emphasis mine], you're going to be able to compete with us.""

Think about that for a second. It requires 25 years. And a billion dollars. And then too, you're more likely to fail than succeed.

The Chinese have been pouring money and espionage resources into their jet engine development efforts (they have budgeted [300 billion yuan](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030)—about 45 billion in today's US dollars—over the next 20 years on engine programs alone), and are still facing [significant hurdles](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030). Why do people feel that India would get significant results by spending just a few thousand crores?

In any case, the Kaveri isn't a complete write off. A naval derivative, the [Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/built-for-air-force-kaveri-engine-chosen-by-navy-109090800089_1.html) may end up powering Indian Navy vessels. It is also under consideration to [power an Indian UAV](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/now-kaveri-engine-to-power-indigenous-uav-115073001650_1.html). 

There are civilian spin-offs too. For example, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) [now uses](http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/English/DRDO_BROCHURE_2015.pdf) the investment casting technology developed by GTRE for manufacturing blades for gas turbines used in power generation.

**False Argument 5: In a globalised world, there is no point re-inventing the wheel. The IAF should simply dump it and buy the Gripen/F-16/MiG-35**

What is true for cell phones or cars isn’t true for military equipment. In the long run, in peace and in war, the IAF would be best served by fielding fighters designed and built in India. That's the only way it will equip itself with a large fleet on a (relatively) small budget. There are other advantages to developing the technology in-house: less dependence on foreign suppliers, leading to increased strategic independence. Creation of a stronger local economy and industrial ecosystem. The freedom to tinker with the design and optimise it to suit local requirements without running afoul of IP agreements with the OEM. Spin-offs in the civilian world. And so on and so forth. And if going indigenous is indeed the way forward, then the IAF will have to live with fielding under-performing/problematic designs at the beginning. It will have to make peace with the fact that aerospace R&D is a slow, painful process that is fraught with risk.

That's how practically everyone else did it. The Chinese did not seek out the latest and greatest toy because their initial designs (Q-5, JH-7, J-8, J-10) failed to match up to what the US, Japan, and India fielded. If the J-10B and J-20 are flying today, it is only because the PLAAF and PLAN flew inferior aircraft for decades while their industrial capabilities matured. As it is, the Tejas program's achievements have been quite impressive: the country has developed a fourth-generation fighter that is as good as the Gripen-C from scratch. It uses more home-grown technology than the Gripen does; including such critical subsystems like the digital FBW, the composite airframe, a large portion of the avionics, etc. Many of these have been applied to the IAF's legacy aircraft as upgrade packages. To throw it all away because of a handful of challenges here and there or because Lockheed or Boeing are offering to transfer their manufacturing lines to India would be incredibly, utterly stupid. If the Tejas is cancelled, we will have a repeat of the same thirty-year saga the next time India tries to build her own fighter.
",Bernard_Woolley," Well researched and well written. Every post of yours is gold. Please don't ever leave this forum. [deleted] Im not Indian, but the Tejas is something every Indian should be proud about. Truly going to be a world beater in the arena of Multi Role Combat aircraft. 

Its unit cost is going to be its greatest asset, especially if it attracts a market outside of India.  Very well written. Got a headache after reading all the comments just rabidly criticising LCA Tejas. I hope this gets some visibility and people stop spouting nonsense. Nicely done, you might want to add that, because of these similar arguments, Indira Gandhi dropped the Marut and went for the Jaguar. IF we had managed these severe teething issues in the 60's, we could have had advanced capabilities in this field. [deleted] [deleted] Just want to say that if India can develope cryogenic engine then we can indeed develope jet engines for our planes. I think India has just not sit together to see how various government organisations can benefit from each other.

 Many of the companies like GE , Lockheed Martin, Grumann, Raytheon are older then India itself ! Means to say they existed much before the independence of India. So ya they have years and years of experience and these companies got hugely benefitted from Cold war during which time USA government was spending huge amount of their GDP only for defence and space program.

Indian news channels are complete shit and such reporting are expected from them nothing abnormal here but what surprises me is IAF enthusiasm for Tejas. I think IAF is overlooking their long term benefit in not supporting Tejas whole heartedly. 

All in all Americans suffer from ""not invented here"" and we suffer from "" invented here"" syndrome.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  OP given your extensive knowledge you should declare your biases. I mean do you work in the Tejas project or are you an independent researcher. 

Second, can you please compare Tejas to other similar fighter jets globally, specially to Chinese jets and Pakistan's F16s ? How does it compare on performance and capability parameters.

I'm excited about the Tejas. An indigenous fighter jet will help us bring down costs and it can serve as an airforce workhorse for many years to come.  Very well written.
It will be interesting to note if buzzfeed and scoopwhoop pick this side of story...this needs more visibility outside reddit  Will Tejas trump anything that Pakistan or China currently have in their arsenal? Thank you for this very nice write up. Would it be too much to ask for sources / references (wherever possible) to the points listed here? [deleted] [deleted] hey /u/Bernard_Woolley  could you recommend any documentaries about jet engines, Thanks  > at bhel-puri stalls in Jhumritalaiyya

How dare you question the Aeronautical Engineering skills of the omniscient Bhaiyyaji?


/s a lot of the points are valid, but id like to point out that every aircraft(gripen,eurofighter,rafale,chinese fighters, russian,american) has had a radar and a significant amount of its other avionics developed indigenously.

secondly  the tejas in being inducted in a time where 5th gen fighters are starting to be inducted. and its not as maneuverable as the other delta wing fighters that are in service/production, nor does it carry the payload compared to them or  have the flight ceiling.

nevertheless it is a decent fighter, that fills its role in replacing the mig-21, hopefully HAL can bring up its annual production numbers up, the numbers build is a big indicator of the success of an aircraft it has yet to supply enough production fighters to make up a squadron, let alone export. This is an eye opener...phew... Great post mate. One thing though, the figure you mentioned for the development of the Indian Kaveri engine (~2000C INR), I got your point but you cannot make a super direct comparison to the development cycle cost of a product in both countries. There are lots of important economic differences between a country life India and say United States (cheap labor, lower auxiliary costs). 

But, I agree with the fact that the entire project was quite underfunded and got stuck up in the bureaucratic red tape.  saved, befriended and following...thanks for insightful posts > A back-of-the envelope calculation using rectally extracted figures  

He he. I am steeling that. give this man/women a gold Ripping post Very well written post. Thanks OP.

But aren't the points here kinda true?. The tejas is delayed, you have explained why it was and the situation around it. So we can't say that these points are myths, there's some truth in it. /u/Bernard_Woolley I am not rich enough to give you gold, But have a Bow friend. Thanks for writing this. 

Any of the folk who do not want to read this long. Remember this important point OP made.
>If the Tejas is cancelled, we will have a repeat of the same thirty-year saga the next time India tries to build her own fighter. It is always a pleasure reading your posts. Excellent post. Like another commenter mentioned .. well researched as well.
It would be nice if you can also spend some time elaborating the differences between fighters in the arsenels of airforces around the world.

What do you think about a hypothetical war scenario with China and how the tejas might play a role in that? Dear Sir,

You have made some very good observations about the LCA. Thanks so much for sharing.

In addition to what you have said I will just make a small addition.

How good an aircraft the LCA is , will depend on the situation and type of mission (SEAD, DEAD) that it is entrusted with .If the enemy IADS is dense and overlapping every single  fighter aircraft & not just the LCA will have a hard time in penetrating it. For example, even stealth fighter like the F 22, F 35, J 31 will find it difficult to enter the airspace over Moscow. Ergo, how good or bad the LCA is will depend what the adversary has in store in terms of SAMs , Anti Aircraft Artillery and of course fighter aircraft.

Thanks & Regards,
D Nicely written! what they need to do is put in a precision 5.56 mm automatic rifle on a little propeller driven drone that can shoot down infiltrators across LoC. nothing fancy - just some good IR cameras, the ability to fly for 6 hours non stop and one 5.56 mm gun. no need for bombs and missiles. just a rifle that can shoot down infiltrators and can be used during encounters. Lol unexpected Jhumritalaiyya reference. Excellent write-up. I only wish you had written this sooner.

A small nitpick though.

>This in spite of the Swedes having an industrial base that is far more advanced than India's and extensive experience in the form of the Draken and ~~Gripen~~ Viggen.

Edit : Could you do a weekly/fortnightly summary of Indian security matters like /u/dextermilburn does abt the Indian economy? It would go a long way in avoiding pointless debates all over the place. Thank you for the wonderful information. On the other end automobiles like Mahindra and Tata have to spend serious amount of money in developing home grown engine development. The day is not far we produce our first indigenous car engine made completely R&D.  What is the validity of the WhatsApp forwards that claim that Tejas is a milestone for Make In India, and that Modi fast tracked its development after the Congress had tried to stifle it to benefit foreign companies? Hence you see Tejas finally ready after all these years because the PM really pushed for it.

Sounds like propaganda but you never know. I will let actual IAF pilots judge. So far, most of the initial vibes from their side and also from ACM Raha have mostly been positive. If it beats the MiG-21 and MiG-27 in safety and survivability, that is good enough for me, for now. 

Buying as expensive a jet as Saab Gripen makes little sense, especially since we know little how a Swedish jet will perform in 'Indian conditions' (read: higher dust particulate matter, higher bird density, lesser margin of error while landing). But how about replacing our long-junked MiG-25 reconnaissance fleet with the MiG-31 ? After the three MiG-25 elite recon squadrons were entirely retired and decomissioned in 2007-08 how have we filled that gap ? [deleted] Speaking of falsehoods, your entire article is full of them and in reality mostly bakwas. That the redditors here actually upvoted you and even bothered to gold you simply exposes the complete universal ignorance of readers here regarding aerospace development and its history. Responding in depth is somewhat difficult in a tiny reply box so forgive any formatting errors I make. I will quote your text in **bold** and my reply normally.

**The figure is technically true, but deprives the narrative of much-needed context. The Tejas’ origins can indeed be traced back to 1983, when the concept of a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) was conceived. However, the IAF did not finalise its air staff requirements (ASRs) until 1985 (and kept on requesting major changes throughout the design and development phase, but more on that later) and initial funding did not come through until 1986. The project definition phase—the phase in which technical requirements are defined and a conceptual design prepared did not end until 1988. The final design was completed in 1990. Full funding was issued only in 1993, after which the development of a prototype commenced in earnest**

The timeline is correct in the technical sense but misleads the reader into believing that the given timeline was the planned timeline. It was not. What it is, is a post facto reciting of actual milestones blatantly ignoring all of the earlier missed deadlines. The [original](http://s12.postimg.org/noceeybi5/LCAtejas.jpg) plan was to actually have the Tejas operation by 1994. This obviously didn't happen. 

**That compares well with contemporary fourth-generation fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon and the JAS-39 Gripen. The Typhoon first flew in 1986. The definitive version with an AESA radar is still not in service today, 30 years down the line. The Tranche-2 version, which can drop precision bombs and fire BVR missiles, wasn't available until 2008. Another European fighter, the Swedish Gripen-C, with full-spectrum capabilities, started entering service in 2002, also fourteen years after its first flight.**

Again this is completely dishonest and ignores a multitude of other factors. Primarily by comparing the progress of the LCA to the Typhoon, you are comparing one mismanaged and delayed project with another massively mismanaged and delayed project and claiming, hey its not that bad. The Eurofighter Typhoon is a poster child of delays due to a confluence of three political factors. A development cycle that spanned the end of the cold war resulting in changing political priorities by development partners. Chief among them Germany which felt that it was strategically unneccessary and cost prohibitive in the face of German reunification. Four major national partners which contributes to bureaucratic delay. Defense spending cuts for the last two decades in Europe which have led to buck passing as no one is willing to foot the bill for continued work on the project and can easily throw responsibility towards a partner nation who passes the blame and costs onto another ad infinitum.

The Gripen had it's first flight in 1988, but it actually entered service in 1993 with the Swedish Air Force with first batch deliveries completed by 1996. Comparing the Gripen C to it's original flight timeline to claim it was delayed is ludicrous because the capabilities offered by the Gripen C simply did not exist anywhere during it's development cycle. For example, the AMRAAM was not delivered to foreign customers until 1995. On the other hand, these capabilities did exist for the Tejas which had it's first flight in 2001.

Furthermore, by focusing on the delays of the Typhoon, you ignore every other fighter development project of the last two decades which shows the Tejas in a completly different light.

F/A-18E Super Hornet. First flight - 1995. Service entry - 1999
F-22. First flight - 1997. Service entry - 2005
TA-50. First flight - 2002. Service entry - 2005 (2011 for the armed variant sharing the same radar as the Tejas)
FCK-1. First flight - 1989. Service entry - 1994
JF-17. First flight - 2003. Service entry - 2007
J-10. First flight - 1998. Service entry - 2003


**Just because the development was delayed doesn't mean that the design is the same one from 1983. The IAF updated its requirements quite often and kept demanding additional capabilities of the design. It was a Catch-22 situation: the constant change in requirements kept the design up-to-date, but it also led to several years of delays because of the need to re-design, re-test, and re-certify the aircraft after every minor change. Off the top of my head, I can remember that the IAF demanded the following modifications pretty late into the program:
•Open avionics architecture.
•Precision bombing capabilities.
•Heavier A2A missiles (R-73 vs R-60).
•Internal EW suite that included a self-protection jammer.
•Inflight refueling
•More capable radar and missiles (LCA Mk-1A)

With these modifications, the Tejas went from being a simple point-defence interceptor to a full-blown (albeit short-legged) multi-role fighter. **

Whether or not the Tejas can be currently classified as obsolete depends on what the landmark you are using for comparison is. If it is the Gripen C that entered service 14 years ago, then no the Tejas is not obsolete. If it is against aircraft that are entering service now or within the next 2 years such as the F-35, T-50, and J-20, then yes it is. I bet it is also the most fuel efficient fighter jet in the world.

India bullying Bhutan?,43,6q4rou,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6q4rou/india_bullying_bhutan/,36,"I came across this post in my FB feed where a Bhutanese woman was criticising India in an International Relations forum. It is a great read and a different perspective altogether. It would be great if you guys can share your views on the post. 

WARNING - Long wall of text

------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHO IS BULLYING BHUTAN?

On 26th June 2017, The Times of India posted a video on YouTube claiming to show Chinese and Indian troops jostling and shoving each other on what The Times commentator said is “Indian land” on the “Indian side” of the Sikkim border. He accused China of “aggression” and the Chinese troops of being “extremely aggressive.”

A few days later, it emerged that the dispute had nothing to do with Indian land. The China-India confrontation was taking place on the China-Bhutan border. Yet Chinese and Indian media quickly roused patriotic fervour and railed against each other.

Chinese media said India would be “kicked out”, “taught a bitter lesson” and “suffer greater losses than in 1962. One Chinese editorial mocked India’s claim to be defending Bhutan and accused India of treating Bhutan as a “vassal state” and forcing it to support India.

Meanwhile an Indian headline read: “China: The World’s Bully”, and another article called China “a geopolitical bully….The mere fact that a vastly bigger country like China is indulging in such antics against a peaceful neighbour like Bhutan shows the extent to which Beijing will stoop to, to occupy territory illegally, slicing it off like a salami, just like it's done with India.”

Through such welter of mutual recriminations and accusations, Bhutan’s media remained remarkably quiet and reserved, with “no aggressive posturing”, as reported by the Hindustan Times. And why should there be? The vast majority of Bhutanese have no interest in the remote, barren, high altitude Doklam Plateau, and have not even heard of it.

But the 89 sq.km. parcel does have strategic importance to India that sees Chinese presence there as a “dagger” pointed at its narrow and vulnerable 21-km wide “chicken’s neck” that links it to its northeastern states. And so, Bhutan’s initial quiet restraint was not good enough for India, and Bhutan quickly fell into line.
On 3rd July FirstPost headlines read: “Bhutan vents out first major disclaimer against Chinese, sides with India…” The article went on to say: “Bhutan, for the first time has taken a major stand against China's incursions …. Bhutan's stand against Beijing… goes on to show the country's unwavering alliance and support for big brother India.”
And that characterization itself raises a big question: Who precisely is bullying Bhutan? And what exactly are Indian troops doing on Bhutanese land in the first place? Just defending poor little Bhutan against big China’s bullying “aggression”? Who, in fact, is more seriously threatening Bhutan’s sovereignty and independence – China or India?

When “friendship” turns to control.

In fact, India has maintained a strong military presence throughout Bhutan for half a century, exercising its power and influence in every corner of Bhutanese life. Even in the remote and strategic areas of northern Bhutan, far from anything Indian, Indian soldiers exercise their authority and control the movement of local Bhutanese. Convoys of Indian military trucks travel freely across Bhutan and cannot be checked for contents by the Bhutanese authorities. The Indian army has occupied the Haa Dzong for decades, and has given no indication of handing it back to the Bhutanese. The Dzongs have since the time of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, the founder of Bhutan, been a seat of power and a symbol of governance.
It is noteworthy that Indian troops’ efforts to block Chinese road construction on the Bhutan border are portrayed in Indian media as stopping China from building roads into India – revealing just how little respect the Indians really have for Bhutanese “sovereignty.” But such spin is not surprising. In Bhutan, the IMTRAT (Indian Military Training) General, and Indian Ambassador both residing in the two most prized real estates in the capital, are said to be the most powerful men in the country, even determining what does and does not get published in the national media.

When Bhutan obtained Asian Development Bank funding for a strategic highway linking its east and west, to avoid the necessity of Bhutanese travel through troubled, strike-prone and often violent Assam and West Bengal, India vetoed the plan. The highway was cancelled and Bhutan remains dependent on India’s grace and mercy for its own internal east-west transit. Just a few weeks ago an angry mob of Indians beat up a Bhutanese truck driver and set his truck on fire for being involved in a road accident.
But this Indian interference and infringement on Bhutanese sovereignty extends far beyond the military-strategic sphere into every aspect of Bhutan’s political and economic life.

Thus, Bhutan is the only sovereign independent nation in the world that has no diplomatic relations with any of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members – the US, UK, France, China and Russia – only because India, jealous of its exclusive hegemony over Bhutan and fearful of any competitive influence, won’t allow it.
Japan has long been a friend of Bhutan, helping fund many developmental projects in Bhutan. The Japanese wished to have an embassy in Bhutan, to foster closer ties and more development projects. However, firm plans and agreement to build a Japanese Embassy in Thimphu were abruptly cancelled, once again due to India’s disapproval.

When China invited Bhutan to exhibit at its Shanghai EXPO in 2010, offering a free pavilion that would be a central installation in the EXPO, India forbade Bhutanese participation. Independent sovereign nations from the world over took part in the EXPO sans Bhutan. India, even if they forbade Bhutan, went and participated in the EXPO, even building a pavilion of their own. India regularly nixes Bhutanese official and commercial missions and visits to China, though it conducts its own with impunity, apparently due to Indian disapproval of potential competition with its own overweening influence.

More ominously, India has blatantly interfered in Bhutan’s elections and political processes. India strongly objected to Bhutan’s former Prime Minister forging extensive new diplomatic ties and carving out an independent foreign policy, and was furious when the Prime Minister simply met and talked with China’s Premier at the Rio + 20 conference. And so, India decided to get rid of him.
Just days before the 2013 elections, India removed its subsidies on liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene, thereby doubling and tripling prices on these essential commodities, to signal its disapproval of the existing government. The cynical tactic worked, and a new government far more compliant and obedient to India’s will and interests was elected.

Hydropower – cooperation or colonization?
But the cornerstone of India-Bhutan “cooperation” for three decades has been the hydropower that is a cheap power boon to India’s growing economy, and which accounts for fully 40% of Bhutan’s revenues and 25% of its GDP. Indian financing, which has switched from 70% grant and 30% loan to 30% grant and 70% loan at higher interest rates, is also the direct cause of Bhutan’s escalating debt that has even further deepened Bhutanese dependence on India.

Since, July 2006, when Bhutan and India agreed to develop 10,000 MW of hydropower from ten large projects, the benign sheen of this apparent cooperation has quickly faded as commissioned projects were delayed and costs mushroomed. Costs jumped $US 240 million at Mangdechhu; they doubled at Punatsangchhu–II, and they tripled at Punatsangchhu–I (from $US 500 million to $1.5 billion), and no end in sight.
And those costs obviously don’t include massive environmental damages for which future generations of Bhutanese will pay. A recent report from India documented severe impacts on water bodies and resources, forest and wildlife loss, and heavy pollution. The same report, reinforced by Bhutan’s own government statistics, notes that hydropower has failed to develop local capacity and employment, with most contracts going to Indian companies.
According to the IMF, Bhutan’s government debt now stands at a whopping 118% of GDP up from just 67% six years ago, with India by far the largest creditor, accounting for 64% of Bhutan’s total debt. By comparison, India’s ratio of government debt to GDP is 70% and China’s is 46%. Why does that ratio matter? Because it’s used by investors to measure a country’s ability to make future payments on its debt, thus affecting the country borrowing costs. Higher borrowing costs worsen debt further.

A recent British report on global debt lists Bhutan as one “among 14 other countries that are fast heading towards a debt crisis.” The report details hydropower’s rapid loss of economic viability, and concludes: “Should the hydropower sector’s financial performance continue to deteriorate, Bhutan’s solvency could be threatened.”
How convenient will that be for India? And what conditions will it attach to bailouts and pleas for loan forgiveness?
In this day and age, sovereignty and independence are much more likely undermined by economic than political control, albeit in far more subtle and hidden ways. So, the definition of “bullying” these days must go far beyond the old-fashioned geopolitical border disputes, however minor and insignificant, that still make for good press in TV images of jostling Chinese and Indian soldiers.

Time to ask hard questions – that can’t be publicly asked in Bhutan!

It’s time, if not long overdue, to question how benign India’s intentions are in Bhutan. How much “cooperation” is actually “exploitation” and “domination? And, how much of India’s foreign aid to Bhutan (now nearly $US1 billion a year) actually signifies mounting control and interference on one side and growing dependence and erosion of sovereignty on the other?

But of course, with Indian control of Bhutanese expression and politics, those questions will never be asked in Bhutan’s supposed free “democracy”. Just imagine if Bhutan’s daily Kuensel newspaper or its state-run Bhutan Broadcasting Service radio and television dared to publish this article. Unimaginable! How ironic that India, the world’s largest democracy that prides itself on its own free speech, utterly suppresses it in its “friendly neighbour”.
And here’s another question equally impossible to ask: How might it benefit Bhutan to warm up a bit more to China, and even to establish diplomatic relations with its huge northern neighbour, cooperate economically, and welcome selective Chinese aid and investments in Bhutan’s infrastructure?
After all, our connection with China already goes far beyond the political and economic to a deep cultural and spiritual affinity. For example, Bhutan shares directly with China the profound wisdom, texts and traditions of Mahayana Buddhism. China today is experiencing an unprecedented Buddhist revival that creates a natural and intuitive bond with Bhutan.

In fact, Bhutan is already benefitting directly from the resurgence of Buddhism in China. From one end of Bhutan to the other, from the giant Shakyamuni Buddha statue at Kuensel Phodrang in Thimphu to the giant Guru Rinpoche statue at Takila in Lhuentse, monasteries, temples, ceremonies and rituals are maintained, sponsored and supported through Chinese donations and contributions.

For all the fawning gratitude, praise, and adulation Bhutanese officials regularly heap on India for its “special relations” with Bhutan, what word of acknowledgement or appreciation do these officials ever utter for the steady, quiet Chinese support for our precious Bhutanese culture and traditions? Support, incidentally, that comes with “no strings attached” and no crippling debt burden!!

And this shared culture and tradition is a major reason for the surge in Chinese tourists flocking to Bhutan, now greatly outnumbering tourists from any other country. And while the Chinese all pay top dollar on expensive tourist visas to visit Bhutan, thus making China by far the largest contributor to Bhutan’s tourism industry, Indian visitors come for free, requiring no visa of any kind. Sorry to say this, but ask any hotel owner in the country who their least favourite, least respectful and most troublesome guests are, and they unfailingly say “Indians”.

The Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed with India and promised to sign the South Asian Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA). This would open up Bhutan to cars from India, Nepal and Bangladesh; further strengthening India’s hold on Bhutan. Just imagine Bhutan’s roads filled with Indian cars, taxis, buses and trucks. Indian tourists would come in busloads, totally over running Bhutan’s carefully planned ‘quality of quantity’ tourism policy that has helped protect Bhutan. Indian presence would increase, Bhutan’s roads would be destroyed by the increased traffic, resulting in more DANTAK presence to come ‘repair and maintain’ the roads, our pristine environment would be destroyed. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed to sign this agreement, even if the National Assembly of Bhutan has voted against it. Showing how he is willing to do whatever the Indians want.
And despite the absence of diplomatic relations, Bhutan’s commercial relations with China are already quietly flourishing beneath the surface – all the way from yak-herders on Bhutan’s northern borders to Thimphu merchants dependent on Chinese imports, whose quality often far exceeds comparable Indian products.

In short, might Bhutan benefit in more ways than one by slipping away from total domination by one of its neighbours and instead strategically playing off and leveraging China-India competition to its own advantage?
But questions (let alone policies and solutions) like these are an unwritten “no go zone” in Bhutanese politics and media. Indeed, it is a telling mark of the sinister extent and penetration of Indian control and subjugation of Bhutan that no politician or journalist dare touch such questions with a ten-foot pole.

Interestingly, India is unwittingly aided in such suppression of free speech and other human rights by the utter failure of western human rights groups even to notice. Rather the west seems intent on drawing attention to human rights violations in countries like China, which has grown so rapidly into an economic powerhouse that its global reach now threatens western interests. Conveniently for India, it poses no such threat and escapes western scrutiny.

Yes, China may occasionally though very rarely “flex its muscles” in minor border disputes, as India accuses. But compared to Bhutan’s actual ground-level experience and interaction with China, isn’t India’s domination and subjugation of Bhutan far more intrusive, pervasive and insidious, extending into every portion of Bhutan’s social, political and economic fabric?

Are there any Bhutanese out there who dare even to ask?",rorschach34," Lulz, you sure got this from a 'Bhutanese woman'? Looks like shit straight out of a global times editor's pen. Same stereotype journalistic language, same hyping stories, same propoganda that they use everywhere. There are two pictures that the author is trying to paint.

In the first one the author paints the picture how India is a bully to Bhutan and has been hampering its development for years. And also running it into debt. Explains how India is isolating Bhutan and meddling in its affairs. Gives an real life incident of Indians burning a truck and beating the Bhutanese truck driver for being involved in an accident.

In the second picture the author paints how Bhutan is culturally and religiously connected to China. Says tourists from China are the largest in number and **all** hotel managers hate Indian tourists. Chinese imports are of far higher quality than anything form India and trade is between them is 'quietly flourishing underneath the surface'. Ends with human rights abuses of India.

Does the author really think China wants to genuinely help the people of Bhutan?

>Who precisely is bullying Bhutan? And what exactly are Indian troops doing on Bhutanese land in the first place? Just defending poor little Bhutan against big China’s bullying “aggression”? Who, in fact, is more seriously threatening Bhutan’s sovereignty and independence – China or India?

If she knew about the massive geopolitics in play, she would already have answers to these questions. She believes that without any Indian influence/presence in Bhutan, China will also not interfere with it. Just look at Tibet where people have to endure repressive policies. [Human rights in Tibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Tibet). The moment India is removed from the equation, **China will devour Bhutan.** 

I don't know whether the accusations made is true or false, but the way this whole thing is written makes me question its credibility. This whole picture the post is trying to paint makes it look sketchy. It is a very biased post which makes India look like a bully and China as their savior.  Looks like a Chinese paid propaganda made to look like a genuine post of a concerned Bhutanese citizen.

Bhutan is a puppet state. Their king controls everything and not the people. People have to wear their national clothes and TV was allowed only few years back. Media is tight and is a puppet and even laws are tight and harsh for locals. If you remember in 80's and 90s, they did an ethnic cleansing of their citizens, forcing citizens with background decent of Indians, Bangladeshi and mostly Nepali's out of their country. They haven't changed a bit. I know in early 2000's only govt official and their children's could bear a passport freely. It's like North Korea of the South Asia where not much information goes in, and not much comes out. And where India plays the role of China.

> The Indian army has occupied the Haa Dzong for decades, and has given no indication of handing it back to the Bhutanese.

India has done the same thing with kalapani in west of Nepal since the indo-china war.  whooh! Read it finally.

He was shouting at some professor guy too who looked pretty calm to me and wanted to have a discussion but arnab wasn't letting him talk . He said he would join the army if it was possible. 

I watched bits of the programme but man it seems to me that he pays some of those  people a lot of money to come to the programme so he could shout at them and look like a proud nationalist  , the absolute best deshbhakt in front of the people .

His debating skills focus on attacking his opponents with loaded questions and accusations of inaction rather than rebuttals and constructive criticism.

SaveTheInternet.in is live. Status Check on Net Neutrality consultations - June 2016,195,4n4o1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4n4o1d/savetheinternetin_is_live_status_check_on_net/,129,"**tl;dr**

Preconsultation paper on NetNeutrality is just the first step of that process: consultations on throttling and VoIP will follow. Have to prevent fast lanes for the throttling paper. We're likely to lose the battle to prevent licensing of VoIP.

Free data paper is very tricky and we're now opposing databack models, after further examination (explained below). 

[SaveTheInternet.in](http://www.savetheinternet.in) is now live, in case you need help mailing the TRAI. We have only 8 days to go till the deadline. 

We'll publish our long submission tomorrow for public comments.

**Longer version**

So, we have two processes going on right now, and a third and fourth coming up soon. First the easy stuff:

**Preconsultation paper on Net Neutrality**: Includes all the issues remaining from the consultation last year in March, when all of us got involved for the first time. /u/shadowbannedguy1 has a submission he sent to this. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4lucjl/the_trai_has_a_new_consultation_paper_on_net/
Important to note that this isn't a consultation but a preconsultation paper. This means there's more to follow. O_O

**Consultation paper on Throttling:** will follow after the pre-consultation paper mentioned above. We have to be careful about telcos getting fast lanes for specialized services, and also them having the ability to charge netflix and youtube a congestion fee, because it takes away from the rest of access.

**Consultation paper on licensing of Internet Telephony**: will follow after the consultation paper mentioned above. It is likely that the two consultations will be separate because the TRAI can regulate throttling under QoS (Quality of Service), but it can only recommend licensing of Internet Telephony/VoIP. I remember hearing that the VoIP consultation will take place in July, but you never know. This will be a tough one to win (as in, no licensing) because the MHA wants it to snoop on your calls, and pretty much everyone in the government would want access to VoIP. Telcos are arguing regulatory arbitrage, and the DoT had recommended licensing. TRAI seems to be open to the idea of recommending this. To quote the TRAI Chairman: 
“An application is providing the same service that a telecom company is providing. TSP provides the service under a licence, communications-based OTT don't provide it under any licence. There is a regulatory imbalance.” [Source](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/52528968.cms)

TRAI has issued a consultation paper on free data, looking at models which allow giving free data to users. It says now that it is considering models which allow an independent platform (not a telco) to zero rate itself, or give free data for how much data was consumed. We hadn't focused on this extensively in the last consultation and we thought data back was kosher, but on further examination, we're don't think it is: We're opposing data back related to consumption of data because it has the same impact as zero rating of an individual site or a group of sites. The only difference between this model and airtel zero is that data consumed is being given back to a user after data usage, instead of during data usage. So, I use 11.3 mb of wynk, and the platform gives me 11.3 mb. It doesn't dictate that I use the 11.3 mb only for wynk, but it has effectively made my cost of using wynk zero. The TRAI chairman has also made some worrying statements:

“Free Basics had essentially tied up with Reliance Communications. So, if you went through the Reliance pipe, these sites were free. If you went through the Airtel or Vodafone pipes, these sites were not free. It's as though a shop in (Delhi's) Connaught Place is giving discounts but to only those who come in a bus provided by Mr X. If you don't come by that bus, no discount. That is not a good thing. If you give a secular discount, it is fine.” [Source](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/we-had-a-problem-with-free-basics-because-it-gave-free-data-only-to-those-who-went-through-rcom-pipe-ram-sevak-sharma-116053000014_1.html) 

[SaveTheInternet.in](http://www.savetheinternet.in) is now live. We have only 8 days to go till the deadline. 

P.s.: Apologies for the delay, but many of us had to go back to our actual jobs (and a couple of us had a pretty big mess to deal with because we were away from work for most of last year). So it's been tough getting ourselves going again, but a few of us have put in a lot of work over the past four days on this. This will be our 5th participation, after TRAI, DoT, Parliamentary Standing Committee and TRAI again, since March last year. 

You'll also notice that the submission is from the Internet Freedom Foundation. We have set up a non profit because we think we need to get more organized. More on IFF and its plans soon.

#Please read this before blindly copy-pasting SaveTheInternet's response to the TRAI's consultation paper regarding Free Data

It is that time again. TRAI has given out yet another consultation
paper, and the deadline is near. And yet again has STI come up with a
canned response that many of you will copy-paste and send to the TRAI,
perhaps with minor modifications, perhaps even encourage your 
friends and family to do the same.  People have already started 
congratulating them for the great work they are doing. In this
atmosphere of self-congratulation, please allow me to insert a
dissident note, and try to convince you why you might not agree with
their response this time, even if you agreed with their responses
earlier.

First of all, consider their stand regarding services that ISPs
provide on their closed networks.

>Content which is on the Internet should not be allowed on the CECN,
>because that would be circumvention of the CECN.

>A movie that is available on the Internet should not be available on
>a CECN for a discriminatory tariff.

If this isn't proof that these guys have completely lost it, I don't
know what is. What is next? A movie that is available on the Internet
shouldn't be allowed to screen in theatres too, I suppose.

Please pause to consider the implications of this stand for a
minute. Any content which is on the internet can't be a shared on a
""closed electronic computer network"". This means that you can't share
files, music, movies that you legally own on your LAN. You can't even
distribute open source software on your LAN. Just think what kind of
problems such a regulation would create for universities or companies
which have a large network of computers to manage. They wouldn't be
able to install or update any software through the LAN. This isn't
saving the internet, this is killing the LAN.

I get it, you guys hate the ISPs. To a large extent, they deserve your
hatred. That doesn't mean that you need to piss over the rights that
they should reasonably have. If they have bought the rights to a movie
or a song, and want to distribute it over their network, I don't see
why anyone else should have a problem.

Coming now to their responses to the main questions posed by TRAI in
this consultation paper, the major problem with their response is that
everywhere they have taken the approach of treating ""net neutrality"",
""discriminatory pricing"", ""zero rating""
as first principles. If I summarize their entire response as ""Net
neutrality is good. Zero rating is bad. Free data is like zero
rating. Therefore, free data is bad."", I would not be simplifying it by
much. If you remove all the sentences from their response that rely on
these assumptions (that is do not argue on the basis of more
fundamental principles like promoting competition, not allowing entry
barriers for startups etc), you will be left with less than five
sentences. Even if you are against allowing platforms that provide
free data on certain websites, you would probably want to argue from
more fundamental first principles. If you read the consultation paper
carefully, the TRAI does not view free data as inherently
contradictory to their policies regarding net neutrality and
discriminatory pricing (otherwise they wouldn't have even floated this
consultation paper). By reducing yourself to just these two points,
you are unlikely to make an argument that TRAI finds convincing.

My own stand regarding all this is that I agree with their point that
providing discriminatory powers to ISPs is anti-competitive. However,
I don't see free data as something that is inherently
anti-competitive. **Besides, given that a lot of people in our country
do want free data, I consider it our moral responsibility to at least
honestly consider the question whether we can find a model for free
data that is not anti-competitive and does not hurt the interests of
startups etc. And this to me is the biggest problem with
SaveTheInternet's response to this consultation paper. It makes no
attempt whatsoever to look for such a model.** If you are concerned
about discriminatory powers that a platform providing free data might
have, why don't you suggest the TRAI to consider a model where the
platform *doesn't* have those discriminatory powers?

Ideally, I would like a framework where any  web services may be
allowed to reimburse the ISPs for the data usage of their users on their website. The
mechanism of how this reimbursement is done, whether through rewards,
a toll-free API, or direct money transfer approach is quite
irrelevant. The important thing is that ALL companies should be able
to use this framework, and it should not be locked via agreements
etc. As long as that is there, I don't see how such a platform will be
anti-competitive, or hurt the interests of startups in any way.

I am sorry that I don't have a ready-made response that you can
copy paste to the TRAI. **If you care about a fair playing field for
startups, please take the time to study TRAI's consultation paper on
your own and write your own response. Don't be lazy. For fuck's sake,
do not outsource your thinking to a bunch of clueless activists. Most
importantly, don't just blindly send this extremely flawed response to
TRAI.**

I will end with a line from an essay by Saadat Hasan Manto. “We’ve
been hearing this for some time now — Save India from this, save it
from that. The fact is that India needs to be saved from the people
who say it should be saved.” Please save the internet from the people
who say that it needs to be saved.


Note: This comment was originally a [self-post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4n96hm/please_read_this_before_blindly_copypasting/), which I am reproducing on the sticky as a comment for visibility. There was a lot of healthy discussion on that post, which you can view if you want.

  Toll free model is again Zero Rating with a fancy block diagram.

However if a service wants give reward user with data (non discriminated - which can be used to access any site) for using its service, I think then there is nothing wrong in that. For Ex: Freecharge model where they give 100 MB as reward when user accumulates 16 tokens (~RS 800)  Have you guys gone back to give even a half a thought about the revised proposals? Can you give even one reason why you think that they are anti-competitive? 

Is this campaign about protecting an enabling environment for startups at all, or is it just about pissing on the rights of poor people? Its funny how the Save the Internet crusaders are marching against the very same model, that they had proposed when fighting against freebasics.

And this one is far more worse than FreeBasics. FreeBasics actually helped poor people, or people on the fence, to get on the internet. This is just giving away freebies in order to attract more footfall to their website without actually removing the digital divide.

Net Neutrality is more like a Neutered Net. Whoa, a nonprofit! I hope you guys accept interns.

The biggest thing about the Throttling Consultation that worries me is that even long-time net neutrality advocates have little familiarity with how traffic management actually works in an ISP. By sole virtue of having more experience than consumers in this area, I worry that internet providers' arguments will get more weightage.

Also, what is your opinion about the peering services I mentioned in my response to the pre-consultation paper? Do you think such programs should be allowed? On one hand, it feels kind of underhanded on the content providers' part (namely, Netflix and Google). But on the other hand, without its Open Connect program, Netflix's data usage during peak hours would literally be *higher than the entire Internet backbone's capacity (~3Tbps)*. Not able to make my mind up here about what would be best for the internet.

Also, it's pretty disturbing that the TRAI is against discriminatory pricing, but is biased in favour of TSPs when it comes to VoIP regulation. 

If we overcome throttling and VoIP regulation, India can be the first country in the world to have true net neutrality. i dont give a shit to net neutrality.. we have a bigger issue that is bandwidth and FUP shitty plans... people cry too much for free stuff.. why not do something about 512kbps FUP limit The idea of restricting what CECN can do is pushing the definition of Net Neutrality beyond its limits. Intranets and internets are beyond the scope of NN and suggesting TRAI to regulate it is ridiculous. The idea of tagging contents as Internet and intranet is asking for the impossible and hence trying to shutdown a legitimate business.              
Also nice point in lamenting about the multiple consultations If you are asking for regulations in the first place. Is the plan to swamp people with papers or something ? >So, I use 11.3 mb of wynk, and the platform gives me 11.3 mb. It doesn't dictate that I use the 11.3 mb only for wynk, but it has effectively made my cost of using wynk zero. The TRAI chairman has also made some worrying statements:

I can't consciously draw the line before this as wrong.  To me its purely in gray territory,  so I guess Imma take myself out of the equation  in this case. I think you guys forgot to put favicon on   SaveTheInternet website. The last date for submitting comments on Consultation paper on Free Data has been [extended to 30 June](http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReadData/WhatsNew/Documents/Press_Release_no44_free_data_Extension.pdf). Please update savetheinternet.in accordingly. Its Still The Start of What we can call as War On Our Internet and Freedom To Access Internet,there are few more papers coming and all these questions have been addressed before including defining nn lets put a simple def to it equal price and treatment for all websites/apps its as simple as that dnt involve data bits and other technical stuff because telecoms are giving a twist to it and i will like to urge those on twitter to keep this message pinned to your profile for next one week

Mere RT will not Work and for this one week Whomever u talk online on fb or twitter or email or whatsapp share this link of savetheinternet and ask them to vote its now or never and we are trying to give inputs to NASSCOM and Other People for forming their Response But we Dont know how it will turn out at the end of day lets hope for the best

From ops own posted articles so people using zero rated plans are mostly poor and uneducated with no means of using other type of internet. 


>This group was overall twice as likely to have little to no primary school education, compared to
users of other mobile data services; however, 42% of these users reported having at least some
college education. Our survey also showed no diference in the likelihood of males or females
having ever used a zero-rated service, or using zero-rating as their primary means of accessing
the Internet. Finally, and somewhat unsurprisingly, this group also spent the least on weekly
data purchases — 38% of respondents who reported using zero-rated services as their primary
means of accessing the Internet spent less than US$2/week on data, the lowest among all
types of users. 


For what are the people using these plans 

>The most frequently reported benefits of using zero-rated services were: (1)
supporting education (17% of all zero-rating users surveyed); (2) health (15%); and (3)
accessing content about the community (15%). These benefits were also the most
frequent responses among all mobile Internet users surveyed. 

> Our first research brief found that zero-rating plans accounted for just 13% of all plans on offer in
our eight countries of study; perhaps unsurprisingly, our surveys found the actual proportion
of zero-rating users overall to be quite low — just 10% of users.

AI is an insatiable data monster, the fuel is big data.
 
US/China has true BIG^big^big^big data, while in India's case - all that sweet data is in the hands of the Muricans.  China has exerted all that efforts on blocking & resisting foreign services (FB, Google, twitter, amazon....) over the years and encouraging indigenous development of such services - now as we all know they have their own and they are huge.

Post below and I'll add.

Note that I haven't included anything about their manifesto because I will give them 2 more years before we see any effect.",skang404," OP - Read this brilliant article by Pratap Bhanu Mehta - ""[A great deal of Agreement](http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/a-great-deal-of-agreement/99)""

Though few things have changed since Modi became PM, by and large the article holds good even after almost 2 years. Few points from the article:

* For all the hoopla over reforms,the development models of all political parties look pretty much the same: the particular differences are due to the timing and context when they were in power. 
 
* Both are incremental reformers. Both reform largely when impelled by crisis,and the variations in their stances are variations of circumstance not conviction. Both believe in the rhetoric of the poor first. 
 
* Both have roughly the same approach to institutions: they are instruments to be used by those in power,not instruments to protect against them.
 
* There is actually more fierce contestation and blocking of decisions precisely because there is so much underlying agreement. When there is deep consensus,the ground of the conflict is no longer disagreement. The illusion of choice. That's because there is very little difference between both parties, the way the BJP behaved when they were the opposition was **only to gain popularity**. In reality they supported nearly the same policies as the Congress but didn't want to let the Congress get credit for their success.


I think both parties are bad but the people who blindly worship the BJP like they are some sort of superheroes pisses me off.

Edit: Lot of respect for OP  for putting up sources for everything. People think I'm a pessimist and anti national when I am overly critical of the government, and even a liberal.  
I've been equally critical of congress government in the past too.   

The fact is that all governments deliver a lot less than promised. The most responsible and good citizens of the country aren't ones who blindly support their parties, but are critical and analyze all governments regardless of which side they belong, to keep them on their toes and hold them accountable. That's true democracy. Not just voting once every 5 years.   

Good work, OP.  One more - [Modi's time-bound promise to Assam and West Bengal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsXMqCnT5u8#t=0m37s)


To number 29, add the fact that they didn't even bother to fill up the CVC position for a long time, they appointed a panel recently after a Supreme Court rap.

 Prakash Singh Badal getting Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour of the country. Lost my faith in Modi Government after that. BJP is no different from other political parties in India when it comes to shoutfests and posturing in the media when they are in opposition and compromising when they come to power. 

Also, I believe that any political party should be pragmatic in their approach and stands have to be changed according to situation. U-turn today would have been the wrong turn years ago. Another point to be noted is that Modi was not at the helm of BJP when many of these statements were made. His personal stand might have been different and since he is in power, he has the ability to change these as he sees fit. Still there are many disappointing turnarounds.

That said, here is my take since I promised OP.

1. The major hangup (according to the article before) was regarding the guarantee of supply and tracking of nuclear fuel. [Indo-French deal](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/indofrench-deal-gives-assurance-of-lifetime-supply-of-nuclear-fuel-for-french-reactors/article133837.ece) has pretty much guaranteed lifetime supply for French reactors. What this would mean is that other nations would have to follow suit or will lose out against the French.

2. Henderson-Brooks is a major fuck-up. They should make it public. But I believe there are a few major bomb shells in there that is making the Govt hesitant to do so. The same hold trues for Subhas Chandra Bose fiasco as well.
3. Aggressive posturing for vote bank, but the basic theme has not changed. Calling Sharif for inauguration was a good move. Gave us diplomatic leverage. Pakistan issue is something we have to live with. Only thing Government can do is to increase covert ops, strengthen intelligence, and speed up arms procurement. Something Parrikar has been doing quite right after years of fuckups.
4. AFSPA is still in effect. Its a draconian law and should be used in the right proportions. The after article mentions that BJP will govern in such a way that AFSPA will no longer be needed. No U turn here. They never advocated for permanent AFSPA.
5. See 2. 
6. The major issue raised by BJP during that timeframe of opposition was that they did not take the opposition into confidence. Secondly, the illegal immigration from Bangladesh has reached its heights. BJP wants to cut down on that and dealing with exclaves is the first step in that process. 
7. Retarded to oppose it in opposition. A definite U-turn that I would support.
8. Uma Bharti talked about 3 years. If you look at the 18 years plan, it talks about short term changes in 3 years, medium term of next 5 years, and long term of next 10 years. There are things happening in the ground level. An example: http://www.livemint.com/Home-Page/PGSRzzCh7mDVIn7c5kGLaP/First-phase-of-Clean-Ganga-campaign-to-be-completed-by-201.html
9. A definite U-turn and something I don't like. Aadhar and UID has been badly managed, but the other option to let go of the 1000s of crore spent on the project. A pragmatic approach would have been an audit to check the discrepancies in the system.
10. Modi was against not giving fitting reply to ceasefire. This time around the response was not something mild. http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hits-back-with-vengeance-strikes-37-pak-posts-15-killed/article1-1272821.aspx
11. Has BJP said anything about not giving Delhi full statehood? 
12. Whats the U-turn here? BJP supported the old bill and wanted changes in that. In 2015, they are proposing a new bill with changes that they see as fit.

Will reply to the rest later as you fill them up. Not a BJP supporter. The problem I have with people justifying this as ""changing for the better"", is that if BJP is going to stick to Congress policies, what is the point of voting them in?

Every criticism of BJP govt gets you 2 responses - either ""Congress was worse"" or ""You're an anti-national"". The opposition currently is Congress so it's easy to pick on any point they raise as ""Why didn't you do this yourself"". It's bullshit. The two parties keep flinging shit at each other for the same actions on the same issues while common voters get taken for a ride.

To be honest, I was happy under Congress rule, there was much less vitriol in the govt communication. There were no govt. cheerleaders. The ruling party didn't make their supporters feel like ""victims of secularism"". I think I've said this before and I'll say it again. I'd rather live with scams than communal hatred.  [deleted] Wonderful collection, good job OP!

Btw, one inaccuracy 

> BJP u-turn on Vadra? Before After

[Just an ordinary man: Airports begin removing Robert Vadra from no-frisking lists](http://www.firstpost.com/india/just-an-ordinary-guy-airports-begin-removing-robert-vadra-from-no-frisking-lists-2114317.html)

 Continued from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3727an/how_does_bjp_justify_this/crj4dop)

13)  Not a U-turn. They obviously need to setup more crisis centers.

14) U-turn? They are passing a anti-black money bill. Other investigation is in progress. Less said about 15 lakh the better.

15) Something wrong with your links. They seem to point to FDI in insurance and pension and not retail. Anyways, retail FDI is still in progress. They seem to be going back and forth. I am personally for FDI in retail with strict guidelines on product stocking.

16) BJP was always for GST. Modi had issues with compensations for states by the centre. UPA made no efforts to take states into confidence and push forth on GST. Another angle is the increase in grants given to states by NDA.

17) BJP was and is against complete privatisation of railways. Privatisation in select areas of railways was always on the cards.

18) With fiscal deficit in a bad shape, I would imagine the Government shy from doing something drastic like that. I believe with GST roll out, more tax reforms will happen next year.

19) 20) 21) No political party worth their dime wouldn't protest against the hike. A bigger picture is to what they are doing to curb these things in the long run.

22) They haven't changed the cap afaik.

23) Good thing they did a u-turn.

24) Nihal Chand's case was thrown out a few times before he was made a minister. In any case, he should be sacked for missing court dates. Not because he is an accused. Kurien's case is the same, but its rather distasteful for him to appear in a global meet for women. Suryanelli case is very well known in Kerala. His appointment came a few months after High Court accepted a petition from the girl.

25) BJP does not say it. An MP said. He was [reprimanded](http://www.ibnlive.com/videos/politics/venkiah-tobacco-panel-aatish-979185.html).

26) Links are all wrong. Jan Dhan Yojana and the insurance schemes are the best things this Government or any Government for that matter has done. Bring something substantial to criticise.

27) Before investigation they alleged that. After investigation they couldn't find anything. I would be wary of a Government that would not do a U-turn in this case.

28) I don't see a u-turn here. Does it say BJP is weakening these institutions?

29) See 19)

30) U-turn? Modi hasn't said he wouldn't dismiss the Governors.

31) U-turn? What I see is an attempt to speed up bureaucratic processes. They should have kept better checks and balances.

32) Khemka got a raw deal. BJP at fault here.

33) Political parties should not come under RTI. But there funding should be transparent. We are far off from reaching there.

34) Chidambaram says and its the word of truth? They are not the same schemes. SBA absorbs NBA and adds a whole lot more.

35) As much respect I have for Antony, he is a fucking moron and the worst thing that could have to the Defence ministry. The new deal immediately brings fighters to India that our force desperately needs.

36) 66A and net neutrality are different issues. Don't club them. Net neutrality is still an ongoing topic. 66A is draconian and should go away. It would activists and relentless pressure on legislative and judiciary to take that away.

37) An MP said it. Most likely out of context. 

38) Unnecessary dharna for somethings that could be resolved with talks? And the backchannel talks did resolve instead of the dharna. Modi's dharna afaik was after rounds of failed talks. 

Great job on the links. [removed] [deleted] Gdp and growth numbers being touted look suspicious as fuck http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/little-sign-of-modi-cronyism-in-stock-market-trends/#_ga=1.81772503.1912375169.1432447443

""Dhirubhai Ambani was a notorious Congress crony and master manipulator. It’s somewhat ridiculous for his companies to be called BJP cronies by Rahul. Businessmen have always had to pay off the party in power, the Congress being the top beneficiary. But today businessmen complain that they cannot buy influence any more. A Mumbai industrialist told the Economic Times, “We fund many parties but with Narendrabhai we can’t expect a quid pro quo.”"" BJP has the same broad policies as INC. They have a better record with old school corruption mostly because they haven't been in power that long. 

But given its a right wing party so there is a strong under current of religious fundamentalism, conservatism, historical and cultural upheaval agendas. I'm not a BJP supporter (they haven't earned my trust and they probably won't), and I don't have context for all of the points raised, so I'll only try to answer the ones I am able to.

\1. N-deal 2007 vs 2014. That's literally more than one term of government. Tactics change after each term to meet the pressing political scenario.

\3. Antics played by an incompetent opposition to maintain the resemblance that they're actually an opposition.

\4. In 2011, the NC was ruling, and the BJP felt that AFSPA couldn't be removed under that government. In the second part, my understanding is that they would have used the JK legislature to start the process to get rid of Article 370 if they had had a majority in the J&K government.

\5. Politics; nothing new to see here. Modi met Bose's one of relatives this year and said he would ""consider it"", which is obviously a stalling tactic.

\6. Opposition being an obstructive opposition.

\8. There's no real intent; probably trying to ""please"" the industries, who would have to shell out cash for improvements to their drainage systems. Also not allowing ash-dumping in the river would virtually make people go up in arms against the government. 18 years gives them a lot of leeway.

\9. They were against it, but Nandan Nilekani met the PM and pitched it to him, managing to convince him to let the program stay. That's what I read in the news a month or two after the elections took place.

\10. Politicians being politicians.

\11. Revenge for voting AAP to power. 3/70 hurts. See the tamasha that is happening at the moment? Grant full state-hood to Delhi, and stalling the AAP becomes impossible (AAP's also incompetent and complains too much, but that's a different topic).

\12. You quote an August 2013 article as *before* and April 2013 as *after*? Seriously? I don't even see a fucking U-turn because the BJP *helped* the Congress pass the bill.

>BJP u-turn on black money? [Before: ""15 lakh""] [After: ""Jumla""]

\14. No citations on your part, but Narendra Modi had said that there is so much of it abroad that on bringing it back it would be enough to give 15 lakhs to everyone. That doesn't mean he promised to give everyone 15 lakhs.

\15. They were really two-faced about this. All the while when they opposed it, they actually helped the Congress push the bill through the Lok Sabha.

\16. An obvious case of ""I want to score political points"".

\17. I don't see how allowing FDI is equivalent to allowing privatization. Privatization only happens if they allow the private sector to control the system.

\18. No, just politics. They didn't lower the limit, so it can't be called a u-turn.

\19. Their excuse is adequate. Re-planning the budget would take another month and cost a lot of money.

\20. A continuation of policies. It's quite normal to see that happen.

\22. Opposition being opposition. Name one country where the opposition doesn't do a u-turn once in power.

\25. Government doesn't endorse his view.

\36. I don't fucking see net neutrality in either article so don't fucking slap words in just because you want to. On 66A, during the legal process, the government was the defendant, it couldn't withdraw the litigation or anything of the sort. The case was continuing from UPA2 and my belief is that the government's counsel told the government that the only thing they could do at that stage was defend, and not suddenly change their opinion.
 Didn't read them all. But first 10 are actually not related to real development within country. [removed] We all understand that BJP and Congress are pretty much the same. 

The difference is that under Congress, I was never accused of being a ""deshdrohi"" for speaking out against the PM.

BJP likes to brand itself nationalistic, but a lot of work it has done as opposition by stalling development is patently anti nationalistic [removed] /r/uturn  : This subreddit is dedicated to the Bhartiya Janta Party of India, U-turn experts > No.25: BJP says in parliament, ""Tobacco does not cause cancer"" because Shyam Bidi's owner is an MP?

Did the party say this or that bidi person say it? He is just speaking his business. Is he a spokesperson, minister or something?

Edit: I think the BJP/NDA govt should look at this afresh. Thankfully it seem they are doing something about it. 
http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/first-signs-of-rethink-in-tobacco-panel-pm-asks-nadda-to-probe/

People employed in that industry is not a reason to not act on tobacco given its impact on health.  BJP is worse off than congress on many fronts - conservatism, hindutva etc. However, the difference is that, Congress truly lacked a leader while BJP has a good leader.

Society is very complex. Even if things are not good, a good leader can swing the mood of masses making them perform better and thus boost the economy. And one startling change between this government and Congress is the ability to take conclusive decisions. This is what the industry is betting upon. [removed] [removed] really? Most of the links are not even u-turns. A spokeperson said this, ally wants something completely different - that's not a u-turn. One bjp mp says something and a different mp says exact opposite - this is not a u-turn either. This is called difference of opinion, also known as inner party democracy.  Again, one can hold a no talk with pak policy even as you invite pak pm to swearing in ceremony. It's not a u-turn. U turns are reversal of policies. In that all I can think about are FDI in retail and nuclear deal with US - and I am glad BJP did that, as that's the sound position. 

Just how clueless do you have to be OP when you label antony (who never moved a file in 10 years as defense minister, and damaged armed forced inventory beyond repair) accusing parrikar as a u-turn? 

As for people showing this to claim all parties are the same, bjp and con are alike etc.. really? No party is like con for nobody has mastered the con game like them.

1) family over country. 

2) hierarchial party with the family vetoing everything. Why elections then? When the elected MLAs and MPs are loyal to the family and not their constituency. Having a congress MP or MLA is as good as having none. 

3) puppet PM as front for family, and the family associates loot.

4) trillian dollar worth loot. Forget the islamic invaders, forget the  british, nobody looted india the way congress did. 

5) and to top it all, yes men in every nook and corner of society covering for their ill deals doing PR jobs for them and hack/hit jobs on anybody opposed to them. Government posts, non governmental orgs, media, social activists, you name it. 

Between a drama queen kejriwal, and scam hungry congress, the choice is a no brainer.  Can you provide specific citations instead of mentioning u-turn everywhere? Would be helpful for people to get a better picture. Otherwise, I wouldn't qualify this beyond another rant. Lol, I have nothing to add to these threads, but just lurking, atleast the AAP thread had questions. 

u-turn is not a question, there's no context here and adds no value to me. I'm assuming your purpose would be to educate the layman, but you aren't doing that at all. The 14th point is stupid. Tell me where Modi/BJP leader says they will deposit '15 lakh' in every citizen's account.

That was a figure of speech- similar to saying every Indian is under X rupees debt because India, as a country, is under debt.

I am an AAP supporter and I loathe BJP. But please don't lose common sense. My answer would be either lost in this torrent of intellectual discussions or be heavily downvoted **by you know whom**. I could not resist the temptation. So here is it.



I am a pure lay man. These are the points as to why  i will again and again favour the BJP , which i had been doing so right from my school days even when my whole family was for only the Congress.


1) Every one in my family has availed of the insurance schemes that the government has offered us. Very easy to fill these forms. I have recommended this to my maid servant and every body that I know off.  Why the previous government  could think of such schemes for only selected communities is what irks me. Now the whole nation benefits. I feel this is an awesome scheme and I am going to benefit very much from these. ( I do not work in a big MNC. Am in the service sector)



2) Way back in 2004 I knew that there would be a whole sale conversion to Christianity in our country. It happened too. I do not have any thing against that religion. Infact i visit the church quiet often. (I love Jesus . It his $@$##*^%$$$# zealots that I abhor.)  But I detest the fact that my nation is losing it's identity, culture and its great glory of , tradition and  Philosophies. Sonia and her 2 children will definitely , silently, insidiously turn my countries' illiterate mass into the religion they were born in.


3) I continue asking quiet a few young adults about their political views. I live in Bangalore. Perhaps this phenomenon  is only  here. But the  all whom I ask are totally for BJP . The most favorite comedian among youngsters is not Johnny walker, Vivek or anyone else. It is Rahul Gandhi. 

You know what the young people say as to why they are pro BJP  


"" BJP might be corrupt but they are 10 % corrupt while they contribute 90% But this is vice versa for Congress "" is what  they say..





Edit: One day I might vote for the AAP or any body else, but never ever for Sonia and her children.


 When did they uturn on GST? Here's my answer.

BJP is way better than any existing political party. 
People here love to accuse any bjp supporter as blind supporter*.

Congress -> can Indian origin people lead the country please? People laugh at indians when they know about the italian origin leader who ruled us for a decade. Shame. In a country of 1.2 billion you couldn't find one leader? Don't gove me the crap mms was the leader of upa. He wasn't. 

AAP -> first, tell us how to deal with anti-national naxalites. In case of war with pakistan, what will kejriwal do? After the ceasefires across the border stopped, it is clear how modi would shut pakistan up.


A comparative study will give you an unbiased view. Instead of focusing what government didn't do. I am focusing what is government doing.

So far very much satisfied. 

10/10 will vote again. Whoa.  Quite a list there you have. But despite these u turns, I am still with them for these five years. 

If the BJP govt isn't doing any good for the country,  they'll be thrown out without shame in the next general elections. 

Let's see what happens.  Personally I am happy with most of the u-turns. There are some false allegations and some misinterpretations in the list. Many of them are not even u-turns. When in opposition they demanded some changes and when in power they brought those revisions in the bills, deal, policies etc.

Voted Modi for his ability to get things done and non-corruption. And he is doing fine on both counts. 1. Politics

2. Modi was never in parliament was he? I am tired of such posts by AAP fanboys. If your response to Kejriwals U turns is ""Hey! BJP is doing it too!"", then stop living and peddling the illusion that you are a different party. AAP is the only true party which drives straight.

/s

edit: 

> Dharna is anarchist, but BJP can do it? 

I read that link. I think you should read it too. Dharna per se is not wrong, it is the way to protest/dissent in democracy. However, it should be done in formal manner. Let police be aware of it, route of procession and a lot of other things so as to help divert the traffic and what not (as it happens in case of Ganesh Visarjan/Muharram), police force arrangement for safety/risk mitigation etc

It becomes an anarchy when people gather in numbers and cause disruption to rest of the people who are minding their own business. for e.g. people used to stop trains when something didnt happen per their expectations. I find this stupid and police should beat their ass up and straighten them. There are ways to protest, this is not the right way to do in a society where your actions can affect other peoples lives.

Did you get that?

The deal was cancelled and a new deal was placed per him. You dont have to trust him but you have to have prove him wrong or prove that it was a u-turn.

ACCOUNTABILITY: This is what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy and our Brown Lords.,82,69jpql,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/69jpql/accountability_this_is_what_is_wrong_with_indian/,29,"If you are an Indian, it would be an astronomically impossible odd that you didn’t hear of how corrupt our bureaucracy is or how some **‘babu‘** or some **‘bade sahab‘** is corrupt and nothing more than a public disgrace. **That’s Indian bureaucracy for you.**

The real problem with bureaucrats is not just about caste and reservation. It is about accountability and responsibility. The pay structure of our Bureaucracy is such that officers get little salaries and large perks and amenities in form of bungalows and servants. In many cases, they occupy the same bungalows that the British left in 1947. And they do not do their job responsibly.

Fair disclosure that *I do understand and acknowledge the fact not all bureaucrats are corrupt. In fact, we have exemplary civil servants that have served as an inspiration to us all.* But this post is not about them, those honest civil servants. This is about what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy. The problem is not about the political issue or power struggles, but about an entire class of bureaucrats who are egoistic, arrogant, inhumane, corrupt and muddled with skulduggery.

**Bureaucrats, Bureaucracy, and Bureaucratic Measures** are now modern day derogatory overtones that express tyranny, arrogance and debilitation in our country’s governance. Bureaucrats are, in this day and age, perceived as those with massive egos and false nationalist zealotry. They are in essence a rule-bound bookkeepers who have ‘I’ mentality when it comes to interpreting rules. They play favorites, they are biased, they stay vague so that they are not held accountable, and they maintain chaos so that no one can see them cheat.

**From Outside: Looking In**

Don’t take my word for it. *I am just an ordinary Indian citizen exercising my freedom of speech.* Wouldn’t it help if you could see our Indian bureaucracy from an outside view? It is said that an unbiased opinion comes from the uninvolved. So let’s do that. Let’s see what others think of Indian bureaucracy.

In October 2010, just after the conclusion of Commonwealth Games in India, Eric Ellis wrote a post titled ‘A most uncivil service‘ on The Age where he talks about the Indian bureaucracy. Unfortunately, he has nothing good to say. He writes the following –

>""The Delhi games showed the world just what can be done when it's daunting civil service takes control – and the result wasn’t pretty. Corruption, waste, inefficiency, obfuscation and a cancerous lack of accountability in officialdom – and all of it on an Olympian scale.

>Delhi’s dramas may have been revealing for observers who briefly touch India but sadly these are the common issues daily confronting and long bedeviling a billion Indians and the foreign investors urged to invest their money in business there. Some economists have calculated that India’s bureaucratic inefficiency costs the country 1 to 2 points in annual growth.

>India’s daunting civil service is supposed to be the pride of the nation – just ask its privileged nabobs – but instead its malfunction and misgovernance hold India back. Enter any average government office in India and one is struck by the mountains of yellowing paperwork, years of filing and unfinished work ground down by the sheer scale of chaotic India’s myriad issues that overwhelm.""


Another account by Lant Pritchett of Harvard University sheds some brighter light on the Indian bureaucratic problem. In a paper, in 2009, titled “Is India a Failing State?“, he described Indian bureaucracy to be one of the most serious problems in the world today; up there with AIDS and climate change. He makes a point that foreign investments, and any welfare schemes in India for that matter, will never improve India’s economy as long as there is an inefficient Indian bureaucracy. These bureaucrats are like a tumorous growth that eat away any welfare funds like a parasite.

In his book “The Foundation Pillars for Change: Our Nation, Our Democracy & Our Future”, **Mr. V.K. Patel** writes that *most developmental spending fails to reach its intended recipients. It is either diverted or misused by a sizeable and a complacent bureaucracy.* I corroborate to Mr. Patel’s description of bureaucracy.

*We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds. Unless and until such an overhaul happens, India is not going to be a great country. No welfare policies will ever come to fruition. India cannot change without a change in our bureaucratic system. This is what is wrong with the Indian bureaucracy.*",therollingindian," While a corrupt bureaucracy is obviously a concern,

> We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds.

These words sound like the rallying call of a communist revolutionary rather than a solution.

How about borrowing concepts from the private sector, like:

1. Project-level ownership and accountability - Transfers every 2-3 years just dilutes responsibility. We need to assign an officer to a project - who is responsible for its success and failure. Officers are rewarded on the basis of their success in projects. They also need to be enabled to have complete power over execution of a project.

2. Peer feedback system - Something like Google's PageRank. Every officer can give anonymous feedback/rating to every other officer. The weight each officer's ratings have on the person being rated depend on the rating officer's ratings. So if an employee rated 4.5 stars rates another employee 3 stars, it carries more mathematical weight than a 2-star employee handing out a 5-star rating. Another system for citizens to rate the officers could also be introduced. Transparently declare these ratings on a website, and using these as a basis for promotions.

3. Lateral hiring - plenty of 40-something execs in private industry have earned all they need and have excellent intelligence and execution skills. They'd be happy to contribute to the society by the way of participating in government projects, which have enough scale and complexity to be considered challenging and interesting.

4. Reduce fixed components of salary and have greater performance-linked components. These could be linked to a project's execution score - the number of parameters on which a completed project meets or exceeds its objectives, and the peer feedback system. I am pretty sure if we have mathematicians/game theoreticians design such ratings-incentives systems we can form them in a manner that encourages performance and minimizes abuse.

5. Consider hiring government officers a liability. We're already doing things in this direction. Outsource everything you can, especially menial tasks like facilities management, payroll management, peons, security for non-critical infrastructure etc. Privatize all PSUs. The common argument for PSUs is that you need them for projects that cost more than the value they provide, but need to be provided in any way. In such cases, just award a Viability Gap Funding to private companies undertaking such projects.

6. Empower lokpal/vigilance divisions - It is that simple, really. All we need to reduce corruption is will at the top. The only reason a lot of these agencies are toothless is because everyone from the MLAs to the CMs depends on the corruption ecosystem to fill their pockets, fund their elections, run their corrupt businesses and keep them in power. 

(You need to look at MNCs and see how they outsource stuff - security, facilities management, HR, event planning, payroll - everything is handled by third parties. Only execs, engineers, designers, PMs etc. are recruited directly by them) >We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds.

before doing all this just try taking away their NFU and see the fun. you sound a little like a disgruntled retired bank clerk Sharma ji sitting on the housing society bench at 6pm eating peanuts and holding court...  A post about accountability, and no mention of transparency.

To fix the entire system, from chaprasi to head babu, put an ERP system for filework in place. Every person has to check in and check out files. All modifications, permissions, rejections, fines, awards, everything gets logged.

That's it. Give a public UI for this system and watch things change. Total Number of IAS officers in India : [4,296](http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=160629) (against authorized strength of 6,396 ~ 23% vacant).

In 2016, according to the Department of Personnel Training (DoPT).

Group A  - 76,066

Group B - 224,337

Group C (excluding safai karmacharis) -   2,851,905

Group C (safai karmacharis) - 47,631


[Source](http://dopt.gov.in/sites/default/files/AnnualReport_2016-17_ENG.pdf)  Accountability needs taking responsibility for one's actions. Indian mentality is all about being ruled by circumstances, and therefore feeling extremely personally attacked for any accountability.

People even feel so bad about holding people accountable. If there is any possibility of negative reaction from authority, the idea is often kyon life kharab karna kisiki hai lena. In addition these days there always is the fear of people having political connects and coming after you.

Accountability word humare cultural dictionary me nahin hai  Honestly, I feel , if all these projects were logged on some website, and there was some field showing what are the blockers for said project, I feel this shit would be solved.... But there is no way we could get our politicos to agree to that, or actually get that working properly. (No one would update it, and it'd die a sad terrible death...) IAS officers are a small subset of the Beauracracy. The inefficiency and corruption you speak of is largely done by the lower level officers and politicians. Instead of taking away their small perks, we should be giving them better salaries. This ""aam aadmi's""  idea that everyone in the govt should be working for peanuts is cancerous.

[NP] Rant against GST!,25,6xsjmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6xsjmc/np_rant_against_gst/,21,"Hello fellow randians! 

This might be a long rant but I think it might be affecting a lot of us here. Earlier, i.e. pre GST most restaurants and online food ordering places had their menus adjusted to whatever taxes they paid earlier and had figures like 199/299/500 etc. inclusive of all taxes. The breakup between the service and the tax used to be shown in the bill and didn't matter much as the bill was what I knew I was paying. 

Now in comes GST! The grand scheme supposed to propel the Indian economy to nobody knows what heights. :| 

Most restaurants and online places here in Bangalore just shamelessly add GST to the final bill and the justification is that it's mandatory. Now, I know it's mandatory for them, but what about the food prices? Practically none have adjusted their prices to take out the tax component that used to be added before. Case in point here is freshmenu. Great food, great service everything but then this. Had been noticing this since some time but just can't keep it in anymore.

Not just food, malls etc. now show the price without the GST so you're in for a rude shock when the cashier tells you the final amount. Didn't used to be the same amount earlier either but now it's way more than what you'd have thought.

I used to admire the current government a lot. Liked the statesman Modi used to appear. Still respect him for the foreign policy that seems to be going in the right direction. But at the end of the day/month I do have to take a look at my wallet. And frankly, I've been let down. Can't be too enthusiastic about a government that's continually taking steps to rip me of my money. I pay all my taxes regularly and do so happily, knowing that it'll be used for the nation, but to what extent do I keep paying up? 

The previous government used to be in news for various scams and the level of corruption used to be mind-boggling. But sorry to say, it never directly affected me or most of my acquaintances. I'm in no way justifying them, but at least they let the middle class grow independently. This government seems to be hell bent on killing it. And it's all done legally, so no one can really say anything. 

I'll go on a limb to say that the middle class consumption was driving the economic growth in this country since the last 15 years and with the measures that the govt is taking they're sure to kill it by making the middle class more conservative with their spending. And honestly, I'm actually wishing that it goes out next election. Well aware there's no other option we can actually vote for, but so so hoping that one comes up.

End of rant. Sorry. Bye! ",_Overly_Optimistic," OP, are you saying that FreshMenu, who used to sell a dish for like Rs.599, inclusive of all taxes, pre GST and is now selling for Rs.599+GST?  Dont say sorry at end. You are damn fucking right. Especially last two paragraphs.  As far as I remember, food menu prices were always exclusive of taxes in Delhi/North India. 

I am surprised that it is new for you to pay tax over prices mentioned in menu. Welcome to new normal.  > Most restaurants and online places here in Bangalore just shamelessly add GST to the final bill and the justification is that it's mandatory. Now, I know it's mandatory for them, but what about the food prices? Practically none have adjusted their prices to take out the tax component that used to be added before. Case in point here is freshmenu. Great food, great service everything but then this. Had been noticing this since some time but just can't keep it in anymore.

Can't blame the government for people's greed. Prices have reduced in some places, increased in others as far as restaurants are concerned here in non-metro city. I am happy I can now enjoy full meals at under 200 a-la-carte if I look hard enough. It was impossible before GST. would you re consider voting for BJP if fresh menu lowered its prices? 
also can you list out which items you buy specifically which are priced high now? Damn right, GST is just another way for the government to make more money. It all goes into the minister's pockets. ",Policy/Economy,2017-09-03 18:58:41

chill. this is not how tax on trading works. you are only taxed on your profits.

if you're so worried, get a CA from cleartax.in to give you a call. it's only like Rs.500  1. are you filing regular return ?

if yes then

2. you had shown assets in balance sheet?

if yes then

3. did your assets ""were"" more than the amount of money you invested ?

if yes then

4. are you liable for tax audit ?
 if yes then


you are safe bhai!!!

if answer is no to any question 

still dont worry just wait for the IT NOTICE. They will just ask you to pay the tax amount plus some interest at the time of assessment plus penalty( only if the amount invested is from undisclosed income)

At last just make  sure to pay tax at the time of filing return for a safer side.

A discussion on how India's economy and governance can be improved,43,5uq45j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5uq45j/a_discussion_on_how_indias_economy_and_governance/,39,"It should be priority number one to get more of our labour force into the organized sector of the economy, increase income levels and thus provide potentially many hundreds of millions of new tax payers. Currently somewhere around 2-3% of Indians pay income taxes (correct me if I;m wrong). This is a horrible tax base, loss of so much potential tax money for the government. This means that govt employees (babus, netas, teachers, judges, diplomats) get payed a piss poor amount. Perfect incentive for corruption. Singapore pays their govt employees extremely well and have almost no corruption because there's no need to be corrupt (cause they are already rich). So thus it is crucial in the long run to increase our tax base and pay our public sector employees better. But that's easier said than done. What do you guys suggest are good policies to obtain this higher tax base?",Attila_ze_fun," Digitization is a very good way to increase the tax base. Sweden began digitization from 1960s by asking all employers to pay salaries through electronic transfer rather than cash and today over 98% of all transaction is through digital means, nobody can hide his income and evade tax. When everybody pays tax, the rates can come down which will benefit the current tax payers as well, it will also help reduce inflation as the govt will not be required to print money to compensate for the revenue deficit which will leave people with more money in their hands. What Sweden could achieve in about 50 years can be achieved in a few years as the technology is far advanced and cheaper today. The incentive on cash must go, the moment that happens people will automatically shift to digital, now a days everybody has access to cashless payment and banking, there is no reason why India can't go digital in a few years time. To my mind, there are two major challenges. 

The **first** is the black economy. It was estimated at around 5% at the time of independence but now the latest estimate is closer to 62%. There have been 40 commissions on the topic in India over the years and some of them have been doing estimates. It has been an-ever rising trend. 

In fact, according to Arun Kumar, India's leading authority on the black economy, India [would have a 15 trillion dollar economy](https://youtu.be/AHTVbMV5x9w?t=27m7s) right now if it had no black economy. 

The **second** challenge is insufficient job creation in the formal sector. Creating jobs, as measured by the NSSO surveys, is not enough. That's because most people in India don't have formal contracts with employer and social benefits. 

This is problematic for poverty, because it leaves them *very* vulnerable for even minor shocks such as an child going ill and needing attention at home. But there are also economic implications, because informal employment is typically very low productivity. 

This means that if a large portion of society remains stuck in informal work, then India's GDP growth will taper off as it moves up the value chain. Already, India has a much larger share of informal employment than even peer countries like Vietnam. China only has 25%, whereas India is at 93%. I'm not counting informal employees in the organised sector(because they are a lot closer to productivity to those in the unorganised sector). I'm just counting those with formal contracts, wherever they work. 

The total amount of formal employment in India has been [very slow](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=15804). From 1991 to 2011 it only increased by about 8 million jobs even as the workforce expanded by 230 million. Modi talked loosely about creating two crores jobs per year. The government data [isn't encouraging](http://i.imgur.com/xVGlZ1s.png). 

 > Currently somewhere around 2-3% of Indians pay income taxes

Let us analyze this statement, which the FM and IT Dept. always use. A large part of the work force is employed in agriculture, which is not subject to IT (estimates of around 40%). So, we are using an incorrect denominator to calculate the percentage. 

I could not find 2011 Census analysis on economic activity, but here is what the 2001 census says - 40 crore work force, out of which over 20% or 9 crore is marginal. Out of the 40 crore, 23 crore is engaged in agriculture, including agriculture labour. Appx. 15 crore is the non-agriculture workforce as calculated by the 2001 census. A substantial portion of this would have an income below the taxable limit. Now, if you calculate the tax payers out  of 15 crore, you will find that 20% to 30% of the non-agricultural workforce is paying Income Tax. 

The problem is that small and medium businesses do not pay their correct share of taxes. Catching them would take effort, and would cut into the bribes that they give out, and hence, no one is interested in going after them. I remember that every economic class would have a chapter on contribution by SSE to exports, GDP, employment etc., but what is their contribution to Taxes? Go after their consumption figures, use presumptive taxes to make things easier for them (it has been done to some extent recently). 

>  This means that govt employees (babus, netas, teachers, judges, diplomats) get payed a piss poor amount. 

As far as pay to government employees is concerned, they get paid very high at the junior levels, and low at the senior levels. This inversion is a problem. But, look at the large number of people employed in useless activity. Railways as the largest employer have a bloated workforce, and the same is true for most PSUs and government departments. The useless bureaucracy creates useless work for itself. We end up affording less employees in law enforcement, public law and order and judiciary. Look at the large number of employees in every municipality and the poor state of our municipal services. This administrative reform is something that would lose votes, and would require guts, and that is something I don't see happening. At the lower levels, there is no employment generation, and governments find it easy to hire more staff in bureaucracies. We should be focussing on businesses which can generate employment. It is foolish to assume that service industry can absorb a large portion of the workforce. We have to encourage manufacturing. Unfortunately, our labour laws, tax laws, and other restrictions on manufacturing have destroyed the competitiveness of Indian industry. One of the reasons that InfoTech developed was that the workforce was specifically excluded from labour laws, and earlier, their entire export income was exempt from taxes. [deleted] The governments keep pushing for decentralisation of administration. Anecdotal evidence, in my state the government worked best when it was under President's rule. The bureaucracy were terrified of being fired or punished but when it changed back into normal state, inefficiency, lateness and corruption returned. I think we need to overhaul the bureaucracy, whereby, supervision and efficacy is regularly tested by the central government Add more women in the workforce and pursue friendly relations with China and Pakistan.If we have friendly neighbours, we can spend less on defense and lower it to about 40 billion dollars from 50 billion dollars.This money should be spent on education.Also,upgrade existing infrastructure and not needlessly spend on shiny new things. I think if the judiciary was strengthened along with the police system, India's governance issues will improve. If people had a solid guaranteed non-corrupt form of redressal as well as a ruthlessly efficient justice system, a lot of problems plaguing India now, including tax evasion, will melt away.  
    
Police need to be strong to supplement the judiciary and uphold the law. All agencies with police power are included in this.  
  
Without this India cannot move forward, because it will be hard to implement new laws or punish people for not following these laws. The courts and the cops need to have teeth and be free to bite the right things.  - Digital transactions linked to PAN and Aadhar Card
- Cash transactions limited to 2 Lakh

lol. How do you explain MBA's and Phd's lining up for sweeper and clerical jobs provided by government. We as a country are doomed. We can have good governments, that reduces corruption, but the very next moment after it goes down, we are back to square one. The only way this country gets out of this trap is through change in the mindset of population. Which is almost impossible, because people with privilege will never want to give it up. 

We can pin our hopes on future generations, but that is another exercise in futility. All you need to do is to go out and interact with them. You can see this country is going to go down fast. 

I might sound super pessimistic, but I'm not far from reality. 

Only way is to make reforms in education, and cross our fingers and hope that in about 20 or 30 years, there is change.  Like Chile, Hong Kong, and Singapore did, we need to pursue neoliberal reforms like FDI, labour reform, and privatization to allow our economy to grow faster. The less government involvement and regulation, the less impact corruption has.

The government should hire solely based on merit and hire using market salaries to get competent people. The attitude also has to change that instead of the people being the servants of the government (communist thinking), the government should be the servant of the people.

I have 2 questions:

1. I was in China recently and it amazed me how far behind India is infrastructure wise. You really have to see it to believe it. We keep saying 'Make in India' over and over, but what is your opinion of this whole situation?

2. I was really surprised when I found out that all of google is banned in China (youtube, gmail, etc.) and the Chinese people I spoke to dint even give it a second thought. What do you feel about this? Which of the two political systems do you see as more sustainable in the long term? I've listened to and read the pros and cons of China's one party system compared to India's complicated democracy, but I'd like to hear an outsiders view.  Hi. I would like to read your book, since I feel a lot about China is obscured in the mist of nationalistic chest-thumping in India.

I believe China is a viable ally, but how far do you think they will go to arm or defend Pakistan? Is India's intrusion into the South China sea more likely to create a more aggressive Chinese ally for Pakistan?

 I have several questions. My knowledge about modern China is pretty limited.

1. What was the Cultural Revolution? Did it try to create a united identity for the Chinese people? Or did it aim for something else?

2. How is the culturally diversity in China? When I try to compare it to India to compare similarly sized societies, it is difficult for me to believe that it can be very monolithic.

3. Follow up question. Is there diversity among people who identify themselves as Han Chinese? How does this diversity manifest itself in terms of peoples identity? Do they have a strong regional identity like Indians?

4. I visited Seoul a few weeks ago and saw that most of the consumer goods and other electronics in use were all made by South Korean companies. I understand that this is because they are very patriotic and try to support local industries. Since China produces a lot more of consumer goods, do you see the same phenomenon in China?

Thanks!

Edit:Typo Hey Brendan!

How much do the Chinese invest in their people? I'm talking about infrastructure to support creativity and personal growth (something as simple as public playgrounds, maybe)? I'm not necessarily looking for numbers - more of mentality and thought. 
 * What is your assesment about the progress of the 300+ reform items laid out in the 3rd Plenum session in 2013.  
I mean how complete is it in percentage terms and how many years are left to go.  

* Do you agree with the recent article by Daniel A Bell, that CCP will in few decades re-brand itself, i.e. China will be ruled by the same people but under a different umbrella.  

* Is Xiaomi going to defeat Apple in the Chinese market, what's your perspective from on ground.  

* Your take on the Chinese cant Innovate narrative of the Western media press.   
Which sectors do you see China doing better than others and which do you see them lacking. Possibly do a take on this to include India as to how India can cooperate and compete given the status of those sectors in China.   


* Can HSR work in India in your assesment or was the Chinese pace of construction on it just a one off never to be replicated on that scale.  


* Why is TheDiplomat so anti-China in its bias and tone, is it because it deals with English language authors mainly and majority of them hold unfavourable view of China anyways and the lack of native Chinese language thinkers.  

* Who do you follow from among the various China Experts/Watchers. By follow i don't mean just twitter and all, but overall, whose work and views do you give more respect and credibility relative to the rest.   
And if possible whom do you not take seriously. 


* Which resources (online-Chinese or Global), papers, books, newsletters, feeds, etc do you use to keep up to date and use in your work/views.  Hi Brendan,

 I'm a little active on the motorcycle travellers' scene. All of us are waiting with bated breath to have China open up their borders for vehicular/motorcycle travel from India to China and beyond. 

 What do you think the obstacles are and can we see the opening up of borders for tourism and travel in the next decade?

Thanks! How religious are people there? I am not well read on this subject, but I'm guessing Buddhism and Confucianism would be the most common religions. Neither of these are ritualistic, but how does reality compare to this? Are the people superstitious when it comes to their beliefs or is it a more ""quiet"" part of their lives? 

This is a really good AMA. Quality questions and quality answers. Kudos to the organizers, the community asking the questions and Brendan! When AMA announcement was done I searched Brendan O'Reilly and I got pictures of well built mixed martial artist. Then I looked at your proof picture and I got a potato. 

My question is when will you hit the gym?  What's China's game plan in Indian Ocean and south China sea There are more English speakers in India as compared to China, how does it change the western media media outlook towards both the countries?

How 50 cent party is different from as of paid volunteers hired by the national parties in India?

What we can expect from China in future regarding India- Pakistan relationship?  How true are claims that there is a disjoint between the Chinese army in terms of its relationship with the government? There were talks of a sort of clash between the two when the Chinese premier visited India and the border escalations suddenly went up.  [deleted] Do you think, Any of the Economic policies taken by India with regard to Manufacturing and services, Anyway threatening China's domination in the respective sector.
Does it effect any geopolitical environment in the region? I work with Chinese people everyday. I find it difficult to communicate with them in English which is understandable given the fact that Chinese is the medium of education in China.
Don't you think the current language policy of China needs to be altered in order to accommodate English?

P.S: I do agree that we ought to give priority to our native language. At the same time, I can't dispute the fact that English is the de facto language when it comes to international communication. Obligatory question
Noodle or chicken curry???  what should i be doing in order to be a political writer one day? Hi Brendan, thank you for doing this.

* 1 Do you think that the Chinese also have this concept of Manifest Destiny that the Americans had / have (jury is still out on that one), only in this case, it is to restore China to the head of the world order?

* 2 What do you think about the Chinese soft colonisation of Africa? It is already breeding resentment in pockets of the African elite, but is this being recognised by the Chinese powers that be?

* 3 What do you think about India's look East policy started by PVN and ABVP? Is it being received well or antagonistically by the Chinese? After all places like Vietnam have always been in China's Sphere for the most part. 

 How strong is the pro-democracy movement in China. Is it still in infancy stage or is more developed? Do you see China becoming a democracy in next 20 years? After Japan and USA, who are the major foreign villains as portrayed by Chinese media? And since communist party is opaque, how does one know about the actual events and decisions unlike.. say Indian policy making? Finally, how much truth is there in Epoch times claims about an insider as part of central politburo?  Hi Brendan, 

Non political question here. I want to visit China. What are the places you would recommend visiting  China has a state run English news channel for international broadcast with foreign journalists. Do you think the Modi government might go in that direction on the lines of CCTV and RT ?

Is the international CCTV helping the Chinese government? Hello Brendan,

As a commentator on international relations how much are you hopeful for increasing the focus and importance of people to people relation rather than just trade (B2B) or political (G2G). between not just Indo-china but globally. 

is it against the interest of Geo-eco-political-Global order?

Do you see BRICS development Bank as an alternative to world bank

How SCO and BRICS can reshape the destiny of Asia for better

do the marginalized people of China face similar deprivation than in India.

How independent is Chinese judiciary,  are their any path breaking judgments on freedom of Chinese people. 

How is average Chinese life in rural areas

so many questions, thanks for reading them atleast What's the situation for employment of Indian expatriate workers, particularly in aviation and engineering related fields? 

 Hello ! On a non-political note, P.K just made 100 crores in China ! How popular is Bollywood in China ? What are your ideas about the China funded APT attacks that are happening on Taiwan, India and even the US(past two months)? Protecting cyber infrastructure for civilian companies (not military contractors and govt establishments) is becoming increasingly difficult for Infosec personnel in the region. 
We can identify based on our analysis that most of these attacks are by PRC and SK. Can you share your thoughts on this? Hi Brendan, 

(1) How is religion viewed in China? Are Chinese people largely non-religious, or is Buddhism and Christianity becoming popular? How do people view religions of other countries?

(2) What racial views to Chinese have, say for whites, blacks, indians etc? Also do Chinese people view Japanese, Koreans or Tibetians as separate races, or people of the same race with different cultures?

(3) Would you say the Chinese government functions like a meritocracy or a corporate entity? Does it realistically have any ideological goals presently, or some sort of a future vision? Or is it just ""taking care"" of the country by making policies based on pragmatic needs?

(4) What is the goal in life of an average Chinese person? What do they look up to in an ideal man or woman? How is this different from India? Do Chinese parents also influence decisions about career, marriage and kids in their children, like Indian parents do?  At this very moment, are you typing from China? Is Reddit accessible from China? 

Thanks for doing this. :) Are people happy in China. One of my friend who stayed in china for years said that chinese prople are afraid of rulers for centuries. [deleted] Hey! Thank you for doing this. My questions:

What is the best way to learn mandarin?

How important is it that India acquire a blue water navy?

How does India's naval strength match up to China's naval strength? 1. Was the recent stock market crash surprising?
2. What is its impact on the Chinese economy?

Thanks! Hi Brendan, my question is regarding the theory of sea lines of communication plan of China, the so-called ""string of pearls"" model.  

A recent report suggests that India seeks to counter this by establishing it's own String of pearls to contain China.  
Is this true and if so, is it, as the article suggests a reactionary check on China's influence in the Indian Ocean? 

Source of article: http://m.firstpost.com/world/modis-overseas-ambitions-vietnam-and-the-reverse-string-of-pearls-to-contain-china-1781389.html

Thank you for your time  How did you learn mandarin? Could you suggest any websites or any reference material you used to learn mandarin Hi Brendan,

What level of importance do the chinese give to the acclaimed Indian connection of Bodhi Dharma.

Do they tend to ignore it or do they acknowledge it? [deleted] * How different do you see the attitude of the Chinese administration of the 70's to that of present day, towards India?  
* What in your opinion would bring India really close to China in terms of economy?  
  
EDIT: Also, can you shed some light on why the Dalai Lama is so hated in China? 1. What's your favorite Chinese counter-culture?
2. How talented are Chinese political cartoonists?
3. Did you meet a Chinese corpse walker? [deleted] Do you see China supporting NK in the near future?  Do the Chinese have a clearer understanding of what India is like or is their understanding as weak as that us Indians have of the chinese? How different are Chinese and Indian people according to you ? 

How different was China and India compared to what you imagined ? 

As a person who has lived in both India and China, what have you learned from both the countries ? 

What do you think both the countries should learn from each other ? 

What are some things that you've realized after living in both India and China that are often not known to people outside or misunderstood ?

Sorry for asking so many questions. I wanted a neutral perspective for my answer. Most of the Indian media and people are biased when it comes to China and Pakistan, including me. Thanks a lot for giving your time. btw can you speak Chinese ? Or any Indian language ?  With respect to India's interests, is the current NDA government dealing with China any better than the previous UPA government? Hi Brendan,

China's bull run in the economy seems to slow down and India's is expected to grow, according to recent trends of dip in the manufacturing economy and growing knowledge economy. In the light of these equalizing trends(which are equally conspicuous by the Modi government's proactive actions in the foreign policy sphere as well), do you think that, like David Malone would ask, **""Can 2 tigers(India & China) occupy the same mountain?""** Who is your favorite kpop artist ? What's your ""go to"" swear word in Hindi ? Are Chinese People happy with how their government functions? Hello Brendan . This subject is really fascinating for me. Here are a few questions :- 

Do you think that there is a mass desire for democracy in China that could eventually be sparked in the near future? 

How do the Chinese people and the communist party feel about the appointment of Modi as PM ? 

Do they feel uneasy about the prospect of India becoming a major economic competitor in the near future? 

How do the two nations compare in terms of international relations? 
I mean China has a lot of leverage over  some major developing  countries and its global trade partners would stand to lose much in case they decide to oppose china is some way. India on the other hand is seen as a relatively peaceful nation with great potential but limited capabilities and influence at present.  

Sorry about the multiple questions. I would be content if you even answered one. 

Thanks a ton for doing this  
 oh wow haha I was going to comment ""*Why the hell does this have anything to do with India ?*"" then I noted the comment count.

OP were you surprised ? How is the Indian food in restaurants, on average, in cities 2nd-tier and up ?  Hello Brendan! Thanks for the AMA. Thought I was late or would have asked earlier.

I have ""what if"" type of questions for you. I can understand if you refuse to speculate. 

1. Assuming that the Indo-China border was settled in 1950s peacefully, do you think India and China would have any reason to be antagonistic later on? 

2. Also, assuming relations remained peaceful, what would the geopolitics in South Asia be today? Thanks for the AMA Brendan. Are the chinese, as a race, really as homogeneous as its government claims?

Some examples where credit ratings agencies have been disproven and discredited time and time again,12,7dskdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7dskdq/some_examples_where_credit_ratings_agencies_have/,9,"Should Indian government really be celebrating? Here are some examples to think not - 

1.""In November 1998, the day after the Japanese Government announced a large-scale fiscal stimulus to its ailing economy, Moody’s Investors Service began the first of a series of downgradings of the Japanese Government’s yen-denominated bonds, by taking the Aaa (triple A) rating away. The next major Moody’s downgrade occurred on September 8, 2000.

Then, in December 2001, Moody’s further downgraded the Japan Governments yen-denominated bond rating to Aa3 from Aa2. On May 31, 2002, Moody’s Investors Service cut Japan’s long-term credit rating by a further two grades to A2, or below that given to Botswana, Chile and Hungary.

In a statement at the time, Moody’s said that its decision “reflects the conclusion that the Japanese government’s current and anticipated economic policies will be insufficient to prevent continued deterioration in Japan’s domestic debt position … Japan’s general government indebtedness, however measured, will approach levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world, and as such Japan will be entering ‘uncharted territory’.”

The then Japanese Finance Minister responded (with some foresight): “They’re doing it for business. Just because they do such things we won’t change our policies … The market doesn’t seem to be paying attention.” Indeed, the Government continued to have no problems finding buyers for their debt, which is all yen-denominated and sold mainly to domestic investors. 
How … could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself? Japan, with an economy almost 1,000 times the size of Botswana’s, has the world’s largest foreign reserves, $446 billion; the world’s largest domestic savings, $11.4 trillion; and about $1 trillion in overseas investments. And 95 percent of the debt is held by Japanese people 

In the New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/business/international-business-japan-battles-bond-rating.html] the logic of the rating was questioned:

2. Comment by formers President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and former member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Bob McTeer who is described as having “free-market views” which “gave the Dallas Fed its reputation during his tenure as “The Free-Enterprise Fed”” (Source). McTeer says:

    It may just be me, but aren’t the credit rating agencies supposed to be rating credit?

    Yesterday, we saw a sharp market reaction when one of the rating agencies that gave AAA ratings to mortgage-backed securities larded with subprime loans called into question the credit worthiness of Britain. As is the case with the United States and the Federal Reserve, Britain and its Bank of England have the ability to create new money if necessary to pay off its debt at maturity. There is no sovereign credit risk. There is no need for credit rating agencies to opine on the credit worthiness of sovereign debt.

    Sovereign debt is subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates in general rise, outstanding bonds, sovereign and non-sovereign, will decline in price, the extent depending on how close they are to maturity.

    Sovereign debt is also subject to inflation risk. Holders of the debt are harmed if inflation outpaces their expectations when they purchased the debt.

    When Standard & Poor questions British bonds, they must be making a judgment about some risk other than credit risk. Given time, investors will learn to take such questions with a grain of salt and not overreact. Meanwhile, haven’t they done enough harm for this cycle?""

4.""Ratings agencies admit mistakes - Credit rating agencies have admitted errors were made when assessing some of the financial instruments that have been blamed for the credit crunch.

Representatives of the three main agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch, Moodys - were grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

They said that their assessment of securities backed by sub-prime mortgages turned out to be incorrect.

But they said these instruments were not too complex to rate accurately.

""The assumption that we made about how these assets would perform in the future turned out to be incorrect,"" said Ian Bell, head of European structured finance at Standard & Poor's.

Iceland role

Credit agencies carry out work to determine the worthiness or otherwise of financial investments.

They have been accused of failing to spot the size and risk of the bad US housing debt that was resold around the world, causing multi-billion-pound losses.

It was the discovery of these losses that caused the global credit markets to freeze up, and ultimately led to governments around the world having to bail out their banking sectors.

The ratings agencies said that credit ratings were just one factor that investors should look at when making investment decisions, but admitted that less sophisticated investors may have been over-reliant on their assessments.

The committee also criticised the agencies for failing to warn their clients adequately of the problems faced by the Icelandic economy before its banks collapsed last year.

Some 116 local councils deposited more than £858m in the failed banks, because they offered a relatively high return with a high credit rating.""

5.""Who's to Blame for the Economy? Rating Agencies - A good measure of who is responsible for getting us into this mess is looking at who got rich off of it. Bond ratings agencies certainly got their share of the take.

Moody's Investors Service ( MCO) saw its profits quadruple between 2000 and 2007 and had a higher profit margin than any other company in the S&P 500 for five straight years, according to opening statements from Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations, in a congressional hearing on the ratings agencies he held in October.""

6. "" In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2010, the rating agencies came under criticism from investigators, economists, and journalists. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC)[39] set up by the US Congress and President to investigate the causes of the crisis, and publisher of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (FCIR), concluded that the ""failures"" of the Big Three rating agencies were ""essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction"" and ""key enablers of the financial meltdown"".[40] It went on to say

    The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms.""

8. Moody's And Japan - But think about the Moodys statement in relation to Japan. The logic (and that is being kind) goes like this:

             1. Economic growth is low in Japan and is pushing tax revenue down and welfare spending up – hence the budget deficit rises.

              2. Given the Japanese government doesn’t exercise its legal right to spend without issuing debt to match the spending, the rising budget deficit (as a result of the cyclical downturn) also means rising public debt.

             3. Moodys asserts (with no analytical or conceptual basis provided) that these rising deficits are in some way a problem per se (rather than being a reflection of the real problem – slow growth).

            4. So in their Pavlovian fashion, they downgrade the credit rating presumably suggesting the Japanese government is a credit risk without acknowledging the Japanese government can never be an credit risk unless there is a collective brain explosion and the Government legislates to renege on its financial obligations.

            5. They downgrade because the slow growth makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit without acknowledging that the budget deficit should increase to meet the challenge of slow growth.

           6. But then you are left to ask two questions. First, the Moodys logic would suggest they want to increase the borrowing costs of the Japanese government by reducing the demand for bonds (because the lower rating is meant to scare investors) which if you believed their type of reasoning would further negatively impact on economic growth. So what sort of logic is that? Moodys (if you had their model outlook) is saying the Japanese economy is damaged because of the recession but we are going to make it worse and therefore worsen the problem of credit risk.

           7. Second, of-course, neither their implicit notion that Japanese government debt carries a credit risk or that their ratings change anything anyway are valid. Note that a sign that government paper was not an attractive investment prospect might be rising yields as investors avoided demanding the paper. But Moodys acknowledges that there is an “undiminished home bias of Japanese investors and their preference for government bonds, which allows the government’s fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally”.

So who would you bet on? A corrupt capitalist firm that has made some monumental mistakes in the past while handing out AAA ratings to firms who were paying them to rate their products or millions of investors who every day purchase Japanese government debt at stable and the lowest yields? The same investors who have been buying Japanese government debt while deficits have been rising and public debt ratios heading up beyond 200 per cent (compared to the ridiculous Reinhardt Rogoff default threshold of 80 per cent) for the last 20 years.""

Source - http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=15787

8. ""What mindless rule is being applied here?

The whole thing is mindless. To repeat, the logic appears to be: Cut deficits to keep the Aaa rating – but that would undermine growth and push up the deficit and debt – which undermines the Aaa rating.

And the politicians and everyone else goes along with this nonsense. We really are not a very bright race of people.""

",kejjj12345," It is a positive development. Rating agencies are deeply flawed institution and they do make a lot of mistakes but In practice their rating matter. They move the market and the upgrade will lower the cost of borrowing for the country which is good.

    Hypocrisy -

Indians from their birth till they die are taught and encouraged to be hypocrites !!! You can check in all aspects of life ! We are taught to be honest , gud etc but ordered , encouraged to be hypocrites so we can avoid discomfort in our lives !

    Education -

I hope we all know that the word “educate ‘in Greek indicates to bring out ones essence to total potential, but as you all know here in our country only information is feed and later that information is vomited in exams and we are awarded a degree !! Later we all are proclaimed as knowledgeable individuals !

So creative training is not given , practical emphasis and training is not taught in major engineering and science streams !

We are having most numbers of engineering graduate passing out every year in india !! But poor technical and practical knowledge of students is a drawback !!

    Blind beliefs and faiths -

With all due respect we were once upon a time very spirituality inclined nation around 2500 years ago , today most of indians are acting like sheep in lions skin !! We are so burdened by blind faith , belief , tradition etc that even if present generation is very rational and skeptical , our elders and tradition are complaining about generation gap , lack of tolerance , respect to them !!

Respect is given for ones higher qualities in various aspects but here in India it's by default a norm to respect elders , even if that individual is not worthy of respect !

I have been slapped and beaten on many occasions just because i questioned many times to my parents about respecting some old dodo , who was pain in ones a** for others !

Some much more to add on , but I feel if basics are changed , we would discuss about other social evils !

India has made a place for itself as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, yet it loses behind in a lot behind in the name of growth. As the rich are getting richer and the poor get poorer, the divide has been expanding more than before. What can after all be attributed to the various issues that pose a threat before every government that comes to power at the centre? From the increasing poverty, to the corruption at an all-time high, the increasing violence against women across the nation, the incidents of terrorism that rock some or the other city, and the rising prices of basic amenities, are some of the most scary facts of this fast-growing economy, India.

While these are not the only issues on the list, let’s go through some of the major social issues that mar the reputation of the country off and on:

    Poverty

Poverty is one of the biggest evils faced by India in the present scenario. With an increasing population of people in the Below the Poverty Line (BPL) across the nation, it seems like a never-ending issue. Rising inflation has added further to the existing problem. India has an unbelievable number of people suffering due to this evil. According to the Indian Planning Commission’s 2013 estimate, around 269 million people (approximately 22% of the total population) live under the poverty line. And, when we start looking around for what has actually been done about it, we wouldn’t really find much.

The government needs to take a strong action against the biggest social evil of all. Ministers need to work towards creating employment, and providing enough for the large population which does not even receive the basic amenities. New policies are the need of the hour, not only for employment creation but also to create a young educated population. Education must be promoted at all levels of the society to create awareness especially among the poor.

    Corruption

Corruption is ruining the spine of the nation, and has adversely affected the economy of India. India has been marred by a list of scams and scandals, which have crippled the nation from inside out. From the Coalgate scam, to the 2G scam, to the CWG scandal and the Bofors scam, all brought forward the weaknesses of a government and a nation as a whole. As the government at the centre changes every time, the blame game changes and political parties start blaming the other, but corruption is not really being fought at the ground level. From babus to ministers at the top, all have been found involved in some of the world’s biggest scandals.

What has created a hole in the pockets of the Indian economy, it has become essential for the government to tackle it at different levels. From strict rules at all levels of government undertakings, to an awareness among the people against the spread of corruption, needs to be maintained by the government. Anna Hazare’s fight againt corruption should actually be taken up by the leaders of the nation and must imply the Anti-Corruption bill in the government completely.

While pointing a finger on others is the easiest way out, people need to realise the need to get rid of the ‘under-the-table’ bribing habit and strengthen our system by neither giving bribe, nor taking bribe. The government needs to take strong action against a bribe-giver and a bribe-taker equally.

    Terrorism

Terrorism has affected India since the day India was partitioned. The dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan has been a long-standing unresolved issue. Using this, the neighbouring country has often used terror against India in the worst manners possible. Uncountable incidents of terror attacks in Kashmir, and its nearby regions such as Srinagar, along with the major cities of the country, have been a source of disturbance very often. One such incident which shook the nation was the 26X11 Mumbai terror attack, among the uncountable similar attacks. India has been disturbed by external terrorism as well as internal terrorism through Maoist attacks in the western parts of the country.

Terrorism mainly causes loss of lives, but also affects the country economically. Tourism in Jammu & Kashmir has suffered for years on end due to the threat to tourists due to sudden terror attacks. Alongside, the clean-up after every such attack involve long governmental processes. How is the government tackling the issue, only remains a question.

The government needs to take a strong stand against the neighbouring countries terror activities and needs to take action and not only hold peace talks. It’s the need of the hour that the citizens of the country are provided with security as well as an assurity of safety as well. A sensitive approach towards terrorists may be attempted to make them surrender.

    Communalism

Being a mix of differing cultures and religions, India has ever-since its formation suffered due to communal differences. Communal clashes have led to a lot of violence in various incidents across the country. The hindu-muslim clash during the partition of India, and the Operation Blue Star which led to the assassination of the then PM Indira Gandhi are the worst examples of communalism in India. Not to forget the bloodbath that took place during the Babri Masjid demolition case. India has been affected both economically and politically, after such incidents took place.

The government needs to handle such issues with extreme sensitivity, along with making sure that communalism is not used for political gains by its ministers. Besides political understanding, change needs to be brought from the grass roots level itself. The caste divide must be decreased by educating the younger generation and sensitizing them about such issues.

    Illiteracy

On one hand, India has a state like Kerala that boasts of 93.91% literacy in its state alone, while on the other hand there is a backward state like Bihar with 68.8% literacy rate. Education is not necessary for employment and learning, it is required to create a sensitive and growth-seeking younger generation. A youth needs to be empowered with education, to further know their rights as the citizens of the country. Illiteracy needs to be tackled as one of the biggest social evils of the nation, as this is the biggest reasons why the youth is misguided and involved in criminal as well as terror activities.

The government needs to enforce free education and strict rules to follow it in every family in India, poor or not poor. An educated population will eventually lead to the country having a stronger workforce as against the world. Education is sure to change the poverty and unemployment scenario in the country. At the core level, the people need to be made aware of the need of education to have enriched lives.

    Inflation

The past years have seen inflation as one of the major issues faced by the common man. The rising prices of basic amenities have created furore among the people. Rising rates of food items and fuel have affected the pockets of the middle class so much, bringing them out on the roads in protest. The government has not been able to fulfill any of the promises made before coming in power, which were all forgotten later, leaving the people to suffer the brunt of inflation.

There is an essential need to bring inflation under control, and bring basic amenities at affordable prices for all. When will this economic divide be erased, is a question no government has been able to answer as yet.

    Violence against Women

Women in India live under a constant fear all the time. A fear of going out alone, disturbs every female mind living in India. The rising cases of sexual abuse and rape across the country, have left a black mark on the reputation of India. Foreign tourists have been known to have been given special warnings while travelling to India, in fact some countries even labelled our nation as an unsafe country for women, after the deadly Delhi Rape case. Is this the reputation we wish to maintain across the world? Definitely not! But, what are we really doing about it. The recent rape cases in Badaun, UP moved the entire nation, though no concrete action was taken for a long time. Rapes continue to take place, and no action is taken against the culprits. In most cases, victims die, and if they survive they live a worse life than ever.

Before the government does anything about the security, the people themselves need to take a stand against crime against women. We as a society need to fight this social evil from within. The youth needs to be sensitized about the safety of women, and the respect to be given to women.

Strong police action needs to be taken against the culprits, and cases need to be handled with more sensitivity and through a quick process. We need to see justice happen, and now.

The country as a whole needs to be ready to tackle such social evils, along with the government. Democracy in india is a joke",PopularMeasurement," Are... are you okay? 2018?

I Don’t Bless The Rains Down In Punjab [Policy],8,8m88d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8m88d2/i_dont_bless_the_rains_down_in_punjab_policy/,1,"Starting from June, seasonal winds running across the Arabian ocean will deposit a massive amount of rain across South Asia. The monsoon is vital to over a billion people in the region. 60% of India’s farmers are almost entirely dependent upon the monsoon rains, and almost everyone is indirectly dependent on the rains. Although the 2018 monsoon is expected to be average to above average in most of India, that is not the case in Punjab where rainfall is expected to be 30% below average. As I discussed in the previous podcast on Punjab, the region is dependent on an electricity and water intensive model of agricultural development focused on the production of rice paddy. A poor monsoon will likely mean digging deeper tube wells, that require more electricity further straining the states’ stretched resources.

This podcast is a rerelease of the previous episode recorded on the economic history of Punjab focusing on how a colonial policy of recruiting Punjabis for the military, and concomitant need to keep the soldiers happy resulted in massive investments in agriculture. This policy continued through the post-independence period where the government of India subsidized electricity, access to water, fertilizer, and maintained high agricultural support prices to create a green revolution in the region. However, over the past 25 years, the state has been among the slowest growing in India as the state as the focus on agriculture has made it difficult to transition into an economy based on modern services and industry.

"Hi /r/india, I am Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Member of Rajya Sabha and a strong supporter of Net Neutrality, AMA",322,387req,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/387req/hi_rindia_i_am_rajeev_chandrasekhar_member_of/,173,"I am Rajeev Chandrasekhar. I am a second time, independent Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha from Bangalore. In the last 9 years in Parliament, I have taken up issues that range from the welfare of our Veterans and Armed forces, the Economy, Crony capitalists, push for Governance reforms, and also issues like the 2G and other scams.


I have a passion for all things Technology including internet and technology policy, and firmly believe that technology can transform Indian Politics and Governance, our democracy and lives of all citizens. I believe that an enabling internet policy ecosystem, including a neutral internet, is crucial to the success of Digital India.


I have worked as a Chip designer at Intel and worked on the 80486 and Pentium chips, Set up one of the first and largest Greenfield Indian cellular service BPL mobile, and then transitioned into being a technology entrepreneur. As an MP, I was also one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court PIL against the draconian Section 66A of the IT Act, which was struck down earlier this year.


I believe that the current debate on Net Neutrality is a result of the failure of our previous Governments r to initiate a robust multi-stakeholder discussion on Internet Governance  model based structure for Internet Governance. For over three years now, I have argued that we must strive to create a multi-stakeholder based model for Internet Governance,  which would have also resulted in a conclusion and debate of Net neutrality. 

I am doing this AMA to:
1.	Take a stab at addressing specific queries on the nuances of the Net Neutrality debate in India.
2.	Take any inputs from this chat back into Parliament and other interventions I shall be making with the Government on the issue, and
3.	Reinforce my commitment to the Net Neutrality fight and make my pro-neutrality position clear.
Here's a link that will take you to all my articles and interventions on Net Neutrality, including my 30 page submission to TRAI's infamous consultation paper: http://rajeev.in/NetNeutrality.html


I look forward to interacting with the community
",rajeev_mp," Why hasnt India's definition for Broadband increased? USA has it at 25Mbps, pakistan is at 10Mbps.. that is 50 times and 20 times better than us respectively. We are slowest in South Asia.. Why this disparity? 

Cost of the internet plans are like 50% cheaper as well in a country like pakistan.  Thanks all for engaging ! Stay cool but stay engaged on the stuff tht effects you and I! Good evening ! 
 Which are all languages you speak, maga? afaik, there are no privacy laws in India. Why so? Thanks Rajeev for supporting political parties to be under RTI Act. 

http://rajeev.in/pages/RTI.html There have been misleading campaigns made by COAI and Facebook like SabkaInternet hashtag, misscall/sms support. People are thinking Internet for all is same as Neutral Internet. This has resulted in COAI and TRAI claiming they have recieved more support(misscalls,sms) for a non neutral free Internet. I fear the Govt will rule in their favour especially with the lobby culture in all political parties. Your thoughts?

Also, do you think if SabkaInternet and Internet.org comes to fruition, will rural India really get internet connectivity at a faster pace? Internet.org has no plans to improve infrastructure unlike Google's similar initiative. Internet.org just wants to provide a few services for free.
 >I was also one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court PIL against the draconian Section 66A

Cool :) Sir, what do you think about governments assurances on net neutrality? they sound vague at best if you ask me State owned company like BSNL has different internet plans for different states. Why this differentiation within Indians? 

The plans are crazy high taking into consideration that companies like ACT/BEAM offer much better speeds, and at considerably lower prices. Cost of the internet plans are like 50% cheaper as well in a country like pakistan via state owned companies. (PTCL VS BSNL)

Service tax has been increased, but speeds are static. Bad pings and overall very poor customer care via mtnl/bsnl.
Why dont our politicians discuss the sorry state of affairs consumers have to go through, even though they use bsnl/mtnl lines themselves? Hi Rajeev, 
Why do you think we are in this position today where Net Neutrality is a raging debate? Isn’t the need for Net Neutrality self evident? Why are governments the whole world over struggling with this question?
 Do you go through metal detectors at Indian airports? Do you know of MPs (either house) who do not? In general are public representatives treated differently than citizens who hold no power, and do you think that is the correct order of things? My questions to you are aimed at understanding the Net Neutrality view that is building up inside DoT and TRAI: 
 
1. **Are DoT and TRAI going to disallow Zero-Rating or not?** 
 
2. **Why are DoT and TRAI not discussing much better alternatives to zero-rating?** I have listed links to two alternatives below. 
 
3. **Why are OTT players (like Flipkart and Cleartrip) not being invited to DoT panel meetings whereas COAI and Telcos are always present?** Numerous startups which have taken a stand against zero-rating and licensing would be very eager to share their views with the DoT panel. 
 
4. **Is DoT still considering licensing VOIP services like Whatsapp and Skype?** 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
As mentioned in this [TOI article from yesterday](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/DoT-panel-submits-report-on-net-neutrality/articleshow/47500802.cms), DoT is of the opinion: 
 
> essential services such as e-governance, as envisaged in the 'Digital India' plan, should be delivered on a preferential basis to end-users. 
 
Internet.org and Airtel-Zero neither provide e-governance nor the complete internet. **The poor should get an internet which is EQUAL to the rich, not lesser.** Below I have listed links to better alternatives which provide the COMPLETE internet WITHOUT discrimination or restrictions: 
 
1. [Mozilla suggests Net neutral alternatives which provide access to the ENTIRE internet](http://www.medianama.com/2015/05/223-mozillas-mitchell-baker-offers-alternatives-to-zero-rating-for-internet-services/)

 [deleted] BSNL, a state owned company, the primary thing should be to observe global standards and adopt. The private players should not be made to change BSNL/MTNL. it should be other way round. Being left far behind in a field like internet in today's times is just depressing.

The MPs etc should raise the question that why are Indians being made a laughing stock in front of the world for a thing like Internet.. 2005 was when we got broadband, and to be ridiculed by even pakistan is simply disappointing to say the least. What is your view on amount of snooping done by our govts?

what is your view on blatant blocking of websites

Sir how to stop this failtel nexus?

Do you think that india should lead the world and make a strong NN law, for other countries to follow?

thanks for all you did sir, I avidly follow you on twitter Thanks for taking the time to have this interaction. I have a couple of questions
1. So far the Net Neutrality debate involved the existing users of the Internet(apart from TRAI and telecom operators). Even TRAI invited feedback by emails(primarily). Wouldn't this exclude the current non users of the Internet, who might be benefiting from concepts like Zero rating? It is ironic that if there was some zero rating, they could atleast send a mail to TRAI. Telecom operators who provide zero rating may not be speaking for those customers necessarily.            
2. What is the clear line between the public Internet and say an Intranet built on top of the existing Internet. If another company creates a walled garden apart from the telecom operator and gives it for free accessis it more acceptable? Then there would be N Intranets than one  created by any particular company and one can pick and choose theoretically.               
3. So far the debate has been about all packets should be treated equally than similar packets treated equally(QoS field of IP). Is it possible to formalise the technical specification in the NN debate itself(to be implemented by the routers)              
Thanks in advance.  With our Prime Minister being so savvy on the internet, be it on twitter or facebook, why hasn't he taken more of a lead on Net Neutrality or come out more decisively on the issue. Surely he could have been more proactive about this. Do you see NaMo taking a lead on this issue, which is a hot topic the world over? Can it become a plank on which he can build India's space in global politics.  Hi Rajeev sir, thanks for doing this AMA.

1) What is your opinion on internet users being given access to a bunch of government related services for free? For ex - state governments can have bill pay mechanism which can be accessible by any user who has a mobile connection. Do you think this will also seriously go against the concept of net-neutrality?

2) In your opinion, do you think having a free and open internet will help get more people in our country on the internet compared to a service like internet.org or zero-rating? Especially in the case of low income families or individuals.

3) Some countries have made free internet a fundamental right of the citizen. How many years away do you think our country is to reach this? Hi,
Thank you for doing this AMA.

1. What do you think of the move by COAI to solicit support from the general public for their anti-netneutrality activities? They are spamming the public with messages such as "" To support the cause of free internet, give a missed call to 1800-xxx-xxxx"". Is this correct? Isn't it misleading and shouldn't the government take action against such messages?

2. Bsnl also offers data packs which offer only whats app and facebook. If the present government stands for net neutrality then, shouldn't the government ask bsnl(which is in govt's control) to stop offer these? This would be the first step forward.

3. Cellphones being one of India's largest imports, are the steps being taken to start production in India enough? I mean allotment of land and other resource s aside, skill development at the worker level should take place and I do not see much happening in this section. Just wanted your comments.

4. If you had to start BPL today, would it be more or less difficult than the older days?

Thanks! What prompted you to jump from technology to Politics? > I have worked as a Chip designer at Intel and worked on the 80486 and Pentium chips

16MB RAM
270MB Hard Disk Rajeev: What do you think should be the focus of Modi's Digital India? 

A telecom department panel on net neutrality submitted its report to the communications & IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad over the weekend. Some members of the committee, however, felt that the definition (of net neutrality) should not be at cross-purposes with the government's policy & objectives of Digital India. The upshot is that essential services such as e-governance, as envisaged in the 'Digital India' plan, should be delivered on a preferential basis to end-users. The policy could thus allow for positive discrimination. The report comes at a time the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is busy in the consultation process of defining net neutrality and whether over the top players should be brought under some licensing architecture. Your thoughts on this please! 
 Hi Rajeev, thanks for the AMA. 

A) Could you chat on OROP as its something that you've been vocal on... what do you see as the challenge for the present govt even if they're in agreement on principle? Was it apathy from prior govt. that has delayed this?

B) Do carriers need to raise pricing to achieve profitability needed for network modernization and densification? Are Wi-Fi/small-cell adoption in a broader HetNet in conjunction with macro buildouts needed to solve quality concerns?


 What is bad about getting free access to a website?  Can you explain Net Neutrality in one sentence? AMA verified ✓

**Edit**: AMA is now over, if you guys have any further questions, you can mail Mr. Chandrasekhar at *Rajeev.c [at] nic.in* 1) What is your opinion on the 1st year of the Modi government? Do you think they have set a stage to do something or is it all just marketing as lot of media seem to claim?

2) A lot of metros have been found to have very dangerous Air-quality index levels (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore). Unfortunately, the government has not done enough in this regard. How does the central government prioritize such an issue which needs immediate attention? 

3) What do you think is the biggest problem plaguing india's development at the moment?

Thanks! Dont you think poor will benefit immensely from the internet org? 
Ofcourse facebook will benefit too but hey, benefit of wikipedia to poor is substantial. Its not a zero sum game right?  Namaskar,

What steps are being taken to lower the cost of internet access in India ? Hi Rajeev! Do you have any guidance for a corporate lawyer looking to get into the policy analysis field? Good to see you here and thank god I visited and read what you have to say; it was discovery to know the other you! I had seen your sponsored posts on Facebook and was like - this is some politician in need of publicity!! You know what - I am just amazed that we have this level of engagement with an actual MP. I am even more amazed that we have people like Rajeev in the Parliament in the first place!  Hi Rajeev, my question are not related to Net Neutrality but slightly different which our country is going to fight for it in near future.  

**What your take on legalizing same-sex marriage and cannabis?**

Thanks! Hello, My Questions are:

* Why did you rise suddenly for Net Neutrality ? Where as Internet is already being monopolized by Companies like Airtel in various ways like introducing: FUP and marketing it as an ""Unlimited Plan"" where as it isn't and is misleading consumers in a very bigway ?  

* What about the great Github ban by our government? Github hosts 99% code if 1% of the content is unlikable by Indian Government should it ban the entire domain? In short ban my entire work?

* Why is our Internet so much struggling when Countries like Cambodia are doing better than us? Seems like Corporate companies in India want to become even more rich?

* Why TRAI's policy of 2mbps minimum broadband not given so much importance? If we want good strong net, Policies like these should be enforced much quicker and should be strong enough to bend companies like Airtel to the rule. Why this hasn't been the case, Not even one ""major"" nation-wide company has offered speeds of minimum 2mbps? Especially in High profile places like the capital?

Thank you Dear Sir,  Net neutrality, Bandwidth Throttling, Data Discrimination are a few problems Indian Netizens are facing since a very long time. Why cant TRAI or govt. come up with an independent body to oversee matters like this? [removed] >1. Take a stab at addressing specific queries on the nuances of the Net Neutrality debate in India. 2. Take any inputs from this chat back into Parliament and other interventions I shall be making with the Government on the issue, and 3. Reinforce my commitment to the Net Neutrality fight and make my pro-neutrality position clear.

1) Questions  

* What about keeping the definition of net neutrality as not discriminating between any byte of data?

* Seeing as you are of the opinion that TRAI has not been working well to take and implement the wishes of the consumer and in formulating plans to improve internet framework and architecture, what would it take for the management heads to roll, and getting better people at the helms, Also who has that power?

* Seeing as India is one of the fastest gainers, and with a scope for a very large number of people that will start using the Internet, what according to you can be done to increase speeds, improve ping/reduce latency, jitter, all the while increasing bandwidth to accomodate the newer users and deal with increasing usage (as a result of increased speed & participation)?

2) Inputs

NOTE: I Speak for myself, but I believe others are of similar opinion.

* One byte of data, should not be discriminated from another, that should be the underlying principle. There should be no change in speed or Quality of Service provided by the different companies involved in transmission of data, based on the source or type of data. **This does not include caching of popularly used data at company hubs or centralised nodes, as that is just improving speeds of any sort of data that is popular.** Paying companies for caching their data should not be allowed though. It should be decided only based on how often that data is accessed by the users in a particular time frame.

* There should be no plans favoring the service of a certain company or entity (government included), whether that be increased charges for accessing certain types of data (ex: torrent & p2p data), or reduced (or zero) charges for accessing data, example: Plans from companies favoring whatsapp/Facebook etc, or programs such as Airtel Zero/internet.org  Same applies to QoS.  This should only be exempt for emergency services such as Child care helplines, during times of natural/man-made disasters (for helpful services) etc.

(Non-Net neutrality based inputs)

* Privacy of data should be safeguarded at every level. There should not be any invasive plans to snoop through people's data unless there is a very good reason to assume so, in which case that should be allowed for a very short time, before the validity of that order runs out, and fresh case should come up that proves the validity of continued surveillance. Also, the fact that a particular person's privacy was invaded must be notified to that person in a timely manner..

* The government must actively fight against foreign (example NSA) and national elements that engage in snooping on people. It should be clearly treated as a Human rights violation, and enforced as such.

* Companies cutting wires of other companies should be dealt with harshly if proved.

3)
# Actions Speak louder than words. Assuming TRAI and DoT abandon moral stands and go for non-neutral net, what options do we have? How can we try to rectify the situation then, assuming nothing happens in our favor? 

As an aside, have you read Eugeny Morozov? Thanks for doing the AMA. I have an issue which is a huge peeve for me. Why are companies allowed to advertise at a price which doesn't include applicable taxes? Huge hoardings and advertisements which have tiny text underneath that says taxes are extra.

Doesn't that amount to false advertising? The final price I pay is never close to the price advertised. My internet is advertised as Rs 999, but I pay close to 1200, fast food is advertised at Rs. 99 or Rs 35 or 149, but the amount I pay is almost always close to 20% more.

A lot of people are going to find this trivial, but it directly affects a lot of population, especially people who do not have the knowledge.  Would you be willing to submit legislation to change this? How much support do you think an issue like this will get from your colleagues? Honest advertisement is all I'm asking for. What are your views on FUP? Airtel has been using this aggressively and abusing their customers due to lack of competition 
 They give just 10-15GB @2MBPS for 1000-1500pm in Delhi even on wired broadband which should be much cheaper while Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore have much better plans.
Being the capital of India shouldn't Delhi act as a role model for other states rather than having the crap and costliest services. 
Also shouldn't the minimum broadband speeds be increased. US is moving towards gigabits speeds  and we still stuck on 512kbps, its high time for atleast 2mbps. 
Only way to force the isp to give better speed in case of FUP is to increase the minimum speeds.  How do you spend your MPLAD funds? I live in Bangalore and I cry daily at the state of my city. Namaskara swami. How much money do people spend on online campaigning for political parties? Let's say the 2014 elections. Would you know? What is your opinion on the free speech row on IIT-M campus? Hello sir, a few questions:

* What according to you, is a reasonable minimum speed for ""broadband"" and ""3g"" internet?
* What do you think about upgrading our NIB(on a significant scale), to suit the increasing need for bandwidth?
* Classifying Internet as a utility?
* Is there anything the government can do to improve/increase the overseas connections?

Edit: word So what really happened with Idea's acquisition of BPL?  I saw your interview with Newslaundry. I'd just like to commend your effort to communicate with your constituents and your unbiased voicing of the nation's problems in Parliament, something which very few of our MP's would actual go beyond the party line to do. So thank you.  As an independent MP, how do you feel your ability and experience in Parliament differs from that of MPs tied to their parties?
How is the consensus amongst independents? Thanks for doing this. 

Two questions ..

why is the TRAI so lax in implementing and enforcing higher bandwidths. 

Do you this it is regulatory capture?  [deleted] Sir what is your daily routine? Daily activities? Do you also work like us 09-05? Recently I've noticed that service provider (mostly Airtel) has various sort of recharge voucher or coupons available for internet ranging from 5 to 50 as a night pack. They are providing 1gb 3G data at the price of 49 from night 12 to morning 6. 

Q.1. Would this be in contravention of net neutrality? 

Q.2. Considering they can afford to give out data at such minimal rates won't they attract the provision of competition law for unfair practices? 

Q.3. Who's the authority to determine tariffs? At least if not a flat tariff, there should be a guidance to keep a check on prices from consumer perspective, mustn't trai mandate that minimum of this amount of data should cost more than this?  1. I haven't yet understood why Internet.org would be so bad, or how that hurts any other part of the Intenet. To me the arguments against it is a bit like the argument that gay marriage will harm all marriage. 

2. Similarly, if an e-commerce site offered to pay a customer's Internet bill for shopping on that site, how is that different from zero rating? Why do you think a country like India needs to worry about fancy word ideals like ""net neutrality"". 

When a tiny percentage of population has access to internet, isn't internet.org a GOOD idea to bring more people online ? The perfect solution would be if there are other ways of making internet (or even a part of internet) free - but that is not going to happen.

Your position is more like ""I want everyone to have the costly multi-course meal like me, or nothing ! - not even the pav bhaaji offered by someone for free"".",Policy/Economy,2015-06-02 21:32:24
Coal scam Vs Demonetisation - Notional loss,28,5lafxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5lafxp/coal_scam_vs_demonetisation_notional_loss/,53,"CAG in its report pointed out the notional loss to the ex-chequer because of a policy decision regarding allocation of coal blocks and the opposition called it a scam.

Shouldn't the logic of notional loss apply here too. Why is this not a scam?",abu88," You gotta be kidding. False equivalency..

Will impact many negatively in the not-so-short term.

Keep an eye on the corporate results for Q4 2016 and Q1 2017. Because Modi Well, they are not the same. 
That was notional loss, this is actual loss.  Not every notional loss is a scam. It becomes a scam when the person/party gains from the bad policy. Coal scam was done by competent crooks while demonetization is the result of incompetence. Because the bhakt army can't see the jizz on 56 inches chin. Because coal scam was notional loss, demonetization will result in actual loss. They're is a difference!",Policy/Economy,2017-01-01 00:45:16
RBI report highlights reduced Rural earnings since Narendra Modi came to power [Policy],16,8ghi3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ghi3n/rbi_report_highlights_reduced_rural_earnings/,1,"**Article in Question:**

https://theprint.in/economy/indias-economy-will-work-when-its-women-do/54408/

**Text from the article:**

Rural India’s wages have taken a significant fall since 2014, when the Modi government assumed office, and agricultural workers have been hit particularly hard, according to an RBI analysis released Wednesday.

According to an RBI working paper titled ‘Rural Wage Dynamics in India: What Role Does Inflation Play?’ price rise took a heavy toll on the purchasing power of wages in India’s villages, throwing their growth into “negative territory” occasionally.

“This phase (post November 2014) is also characterised by low inflation occasionally surpassing growth in nominal rural wages, pushing real wage growth to the negative territory,” the report adds.

It points to the uptick in rural wages between 2007-08 and 2012-13, and notes that it occurred despite “elevated inflation”. Two factors are cited for this — implementation of the rural employment scheme MGNREGS and a healthy growth in the construction sector; factors that, the paper claims, have weakened in significance since.

Impact of MGNREGS
The report points out that though the phase after 2014 has been labelled a period of rural distress, the gap between average growth in rural wages and rural inflation is not so significant — while rural inflation was recorded at 4 per cent, the growth rates in nominal agricultural and non-agricultural wages averaged at 5.6 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively.

It says that since 2014, the relative underperformance of MGNREGS has been one of the main factors behind the slow growth in rural wages.

“MGNREGS, which was a driving factor (of growth in rural wages) during 2008-09 to 2011-12, seemed to have lost momentum in the recent years,” the paper said.

Under MGNREGS, the average number of employment days per household annually has generally been between 40 and 50, though the promise is for 100.

The average number of person-days for each household employed under MGNREGS fell during this period, as did the number of households getting 100 work days a year.

“MGNREGS wage growth also witnessed some moderation in the recent years, which could partly be due to indexation of wages to inflation and partly because of issues related to wage-fixation policies of the government,” the report added.

The other factors at play
According to the report, a host of other factors have been cited for the dampened growth of rural wages, “including the global slowdown in growth, collapse of international primary commodity prices and major contraction in food prices… most of which began around 2013-14”.

“Domestically, the economy suffered two consecutive droughts in 2014-15 and 2015-16. Growth in agricultural GDP slackened,” the RBI paper added.

Also, the construction sector, which boomed during 2000-2012 and was the major driver of rural non-farm employment, slowed significantly in the period concerned.

The report adds, “Also, 2014-15 and 2015-16 were subnormal monsoon years with weaker growth in agricultural GDP. The rural economy witnessed some revival in 2016-17 as monsoon turned normal…it did not provide a significant boost to the agricultural wages.”

Modi’s rural push found wanting?
The empowerment of rural India has been among the main promises of the Modi government, which has introduced several initiatives to this end, including Jan Dhan (to get every resident on the banking network), Ujjwala (to ensure an LPG connection for every household), the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (where every MP adopts a village for its development), and the PM Fasal Bima Yojana (for crop insurance).

There’s Swachh Bharat, with its push for the construction of toilets, and PM Awaas Yojana (Grameen), which has notched completion figures that are nearly twice its predecessor’s.

The crux of this push has been the belief that India’s development has to start from its villages.

However, a year before the 2019 general elections, there have been several reports of disenchantment with his government in the hinterland, with the opposition painting it as an administration that priorities business interests over farmers’.

Just recently, thousands of farmers marched to Mumbai seeking a loan waiver and the implementation of Swaminathan Commission recommendations, forcing the BJP-led Maharashtra government to give in.

In last year’s Gujarat’s polls, the BJP performed poorly in rural areas, pushing the party’s central government to renew its commitment to the rural economy.

""A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site Quora.

 What is your view on the saying ""Congress has looted India for 70 years?""

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. 

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.

The economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

I received this message. I want you to read and think about it. I am forwarding for that purpose""

",Bikihuigormint," BJP has learnt a lot from the humble onion, narratives on narratives and the core, nothing. > Nobody gave India confidence! 

Playing with people's insecurities. Not getting any women. Use this Axe deodorant and women will flock to you.

Did congress do nothing to give confidence to Indian people? When congress came to power it denotified the tribes which had so far been classified as criminal tribes. By recognizing their humanity, and by giving them an equal opportunity did it not give them confidence. What about the right to vote given to women and outcasts? Was it not ahistoric in the region. And the states which were created on linguistic basis. 

> MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

It was exactly opposite. Gandhism is a method to uphold the humanity and moral standards of the victims. 

> Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. 

When congress came to power, one of the first thing it did was to abolish zamindari system. Then it gave voice and entitlements to outcasts. 

> Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Dynamism of British period? Are sanghis missing their 'golden age' under white masters?

> people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered

People were not waiting for alms. People were poor and starving. Some folks have forgotten how poor India was and still it. Should congress have allowed them to die like China did? Is taking care of starving people and empowering them mutually exclusive? Can you not do both at the same time? Was it not something congress did?


> India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. 

NRI's guilt. 

 
 FFS all these chutiyas complaining about India's ""weakness and impotence"" are so clearly projecting their own shortcomings.

India managed to stay ""non-aligned"" under severe pressure from both US and USSR under Nehru. We were able to stave off handing over economy to the World Bank and IMF for as long as we could and when he opened up, we did it on our terms. We engaged in 4 wars and came out on top in at least 3.

We lifted more people out of poverty than any other country except China and corrected social injustices like untouchability which had existed for centuries.

And all of this while being a functional democracy, empowering civic institutions and fostering an inclusive multilingual, multicultural society.

How on earth - can someone say that is weak? If your family thinks this is any sort of accurate or well articulated I fear for their intelligence. Just a hypocritical NRI bhakt ranting about things he is  too lazy and selfish to change himself.  So many similarities between our new dumb entitled middle class and the hypocritical nationalist nris.",Policy/Economy,2018-02-22 13:43:35

This section takes a look at the top security news around the world which impact most of us.

**[Bad month for Ethereum. Heists worth more than $50 mn in total](http://wccftech.com/hacker-love-ethereum-8-4-million/)**

Ethereum ecosystem is going through a rough patch. Ethereum is a blockchain based distributed computing platform and has a corresponding cryptocurrency called ""Ether"". Several hacks happened in this month totalling more than $50 mn. Apart from the bugs in the code leading to the hacks, another issue that came out to the front is hacking of the websites offering ICO (Initial Coin Offerings). At least one of these is also suspected to be an inside job/scam rather than being a hack. If you are thinking of investing in cryptocurrency, make sure to read up, A LOT, before investing and keep all your coins offline. I'd suggest to avoid ICOs in particular as can be seen in the above news and all over the bitcoin/other cryptocurrency forums and the news just keeps pouring in about malafide intentions behind most of them like this: https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/to-the-qrl-community-13c1e96e10c5

**[Update to iOS 10.3.3 now: Apple patches serious Wi-Fi exploit](http://www.macworld.com/article/3209658/security/serious-wi-fi-exploit-patched-by-apple-before-its-found-in-the-wild.html)**

Apple patched a bug recently, interestingly right before DEFCON 2017, that allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code on iOS devices over WiFi, without any interaction with the user. Make sure to update your devices asap. Most probably, you are not at DEFCON (if you are, you probably already know about this ;) ), but your friendly neighborhood teenage hacker may be out looking to get a guinea pig for his new attack :)

My predictions for economy in coming days and Modi's Grand plan!,46,4p36hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4p36hm/my_predictions_for_economy_in_coming_days_and/,104,"First thing first, Now that Raghuram Rajan is out.
Next thing on Modi's List is to appoint his one more chamcha, as this has been followed across multiple appointments in recent times, and i am betting all my shares on Arvind Panagarhia, the guy with a record for licking his ass.
What next you ask?
Well, pretty easy to guess in next monetary policy review meeting u will get a massive rate cut to pump cheap money in order to boost manufacturing and consumption
well this might seems good in a very short run will have a really bad impact on our robust fundamentals built by rajan over the long period of time.
The same bad fundamentals which have resulted in a bad economy in many western countries and experiencing hard time passing over it.
I am being cynical here, but i guess thats grand picture by modi, to show this mirage to fellow indians who will make sure to vote him in power again  in 2019!
I am open to more ideas and predictions",meetmanav," So, here is how it works .

Interest rates in India are at 8%, Brazil is at 7% , China at 6% , Malaysia and Philippines at about 4%.

Let's say  - You are a US manufacturing company.  Or a European car manufacturer ;you need to start a business - let's say outsource your manufacturing or create a new plant for export to developing market.

You would need to raise a share of the capital locally unless your pockets are already heavy and drooping because of all the moolah. Plus local partnerships and whatnot. 

If the Philippines offers you a similar labor cost, easy availability of land, and cheaper cash vis a vis India ... you're more likely to invest there.
Locals, when they see their savings returning next to nothing are more likely to park their money elsewhere . Stocks, commodities, gold and property.

On the flipside , easy availability of cash in the market means that a high demand for the above has been created. Means property is likely to get more expensive, stocks valued higher, same for commodities .... something that fucks up inflation. This takes a few months after interest rate changes. You also tend to piss off pensioners this way.

Now the impact of inflation is directly felt by the populace. Older people , pensioners,  and civil workers would hate the government for it. Inflation can lose elections for governments.

It is the Job of the Governer of the RBI to maintain this delicate balance between inflation , lending rates and borrowing rates. This has a direct impact on the trust of the stock markets . 

R3 might have been a good economist and would have made a great governor again, but the kind of Rajan pooja I see on randia is fucking retarded to the highest degree. 
These positions work on consensus of large teams and great amounts of data, and it would take a special kind of visionary moron to fuck it up

TL; DR - no-one gives a flying fuck about what you or I think.  The RBI would do it's job regardless of who the top-man is . Enough of this armchair economics randia !



Edit 1:  Want to know more about the interest rates around the globe - here you go - http://www.worldinterestrates.info/ What credentials? Who gives a hoot in hell what you think if you're not knowledgeable. 

What do you base this upon? 

Degree from Yale? Stanford? Harvard?

Do tell.

I am dying to know.  We need a good booming solid economy and there's no reason rate cuts will not get us there. But capitalism itself is cyclical in nature. There will be a bust some day no matter what and how we get there.  Why is that a bad thing? With the major world economies in a bad state, now is the time for us to seize the advantage. 

Rajan did his job in stabilizing our fundamentals and now I feel that the benefits of rate cuts will far outweigh the harm that you are predicting.  /r/shittyconspiracytheories are...thataway. India has 300 million people who have to be employed in the next 10 years.
For this, India needs to create jobs. for jobs we want more industries to come up. Especially SME's. Current interest rates are not viable to start these industries.
With a new RBI guv,perhaps this can be fixed.

IF the people who voted for modi vote for him in 2019, it is enough for Namo to come back. You might dislike Modi as much as you like, but you probably know that **Modi will not let the RSS/Swamy messup the economy**. 

He will let RSS have its way with culture/education/arts/health/research - but economy is far too important for Modi to mess up. 

Rajan's shoes are difficult to fill, but I am pretty sure Modi will find someone good for the job. Wow. Are you an edgy kid? There was a time when people could get their point across without sounding like Rakhi Sawant. Before we go any further, we need to know – are you a fan of Bayes' rule? Rate cuts are coming. Adani needs to borrow cheap. 

NPAs are going to be hidden again because who wants to return money when they can get away with it. 

Bail outs are coming because the tax payers will always end up paying for acche din of defaulters. Dont know about a chamcha, but he will def employ someone willing to toe his line on easy monetary policy. Cut rates, boost asset prices. Sensex touches 30,000 and jaitley and co. come out dancing on TV channels. 


Inflation starts rising, asset bubbles start forming and GDP growth goes to 9-10%

Yay Achhe Din!


2018 rolls around and Jaitley does a magic trick in his budget speech to appease the masses. Loan forgiveness, sops for the middle class and traders. 


All this while, Reliance refinances its loans and rolls out Jio. Banks are bailed out and are ready for another rave party. Rupee keeps trending downwards making exports cheaper but oil imports expensive. Balance of payment situation is OK or deteriorating. 


Corporate balance sheet improves as banks refi all bad loans. Mallaya is also forgiven. 


2018 - some non issue creeps up - a mini riot, ram temple, beef eating, ghar wapsi, love jihad. Enough to polarize the Hindus to vote for Modi. 


Rahul Gandhi, president of congress, farts crap at rallies and kejriwal can't think beyond fake degrees and free water. 


Modi is re elected and the whole cycle starts again.  I agree 100% ( not on arvind he may chose anyone of his chamchas for rate cut) and his recent push on FDI too indicates the same .

I think Modi has fallen in his own trap of Acche Din and he thinks that easy money - big corporate loan can do good things for him . This plot has so many holes that i can only laugh , in short run , it will definitely cause inflation . 

I think Modi has just ensured 2019 won't be his term bcoz Indians like most people hate inflation especially the masses or maybe he has just ensured party funds for 2019 from big corporates and at the opportune time people will be mass-distracted to poll on emotive issues ( may be small scale multiple riots all across India , one can see the plot unfolding in UP ) . 

> pump cheap money in order to boost manufacturing and consumption

To add to it , there is a very aggressive push gng on in South Chhattisgarh against naxals , which is largely centered around only those areas where mines have been allotted , even forest right act which ensures land right to tribals are being diluted to ease acquisition and mining  Rate cuts will push up asset prices in a short while; but they will not revive capex everything is in overcapacity and demand is weak. Years of inflation and a falling savings rate has killed the consumer. Companies don't invest without demand. 

Having said that as crude prices start to get priced in and along with loose monetary and inflation riises and real rates become negative; you'll see asset prices fall as foreign capital starts to leave. And to defend the INR the government will be forced to raise interest which will then tank asset prices and we'll be back to square one i.e where we were when Rajan took over in 2013 with the end of the UPA.

Oh and further malinvinvestment in the short run will end up causing a banking crisis eventually. ",Policy/Economy,2016-06-21 14:05:10

[Scheduled]The population debate: The depopulation phase of India and it's impact of the economy,55,56bi87,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/56bi87/scheduledthe_population_debate_the_depopulation/,50,"Here's a question:
We know through stats that around 2050-60, the population the country will fall down, and with an estimated 2-digit trillion economy, we will see the rise of the GDP per capita.

This is all WITH the current TFR (It is at a replacement rate). Now we change some data shall we? The goverment decides that from tomorrow, would apply mandatory childless policies. It's illegal to procreate and people would need to adopt children if they want to be, you know, parents. Amazing! Orphans would get new homes and they are really happy (Let us assume, they law is perfectly enforced).

The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down. However, there's this problem: We have a lot old people, and the thing is *they can't work*. Especially a country like India, where there is huge population and on top of that: *a huge old population*. How are we going to give them pensions? Government would *spend* more than *gain* more? An old poor population isn't a very good incentive for FDI either. How are we going to tackle the massive grey population we have?

Ninja edit: some words

edit 2: I'm not against depopulation, but I believe there are multiple ways to solve the population problem.",miguel-styx," Childfree is only thing going to save India from catastrophe of Water shortage, malnutrition, Quality education, natural resources stress, Urban problems, overcrowding. Climate change is already making all problems worse, just look at farmers 300 million people were affected by Drought in last 2 years. farmers in India suffer from very high levels of malnutrition due to lack of awareness and low incomes.

Isn't it shocking that 700 million people in India still depend on Agriculture?

Yes Indian economy would grow but only top 20-30%( maybe 400 million people) of people are going gain hugely, the bottom 20% people will still suffer problems due to climate change. Either we make a decision now or forever be condemn to 3rd or 2nd world status. Simple answer is from 1.3 billion people, if Childfree policy is implemented today, India will still have billion people in couple of decades. Even if De-population occurs we will still have billion people.

If say India reaches 2.0 fertility rate in next five years and continuues trends, India will have 1.8 billion people by 2060.

So if Indians want to have any kind of decent life, de-population is the way. 1 billion people is better than 1.8 billion people.

So, what about dependency? **Problems of dependency are easy to solve than massive problems of India today or problems with 1.8 billion people.** Childfree is only thing going to save India from catastrophe of Water shortage, malnutrition, Quality education, natural resources stress, Urban problems, overcrowding. Climate change is already making all problems worse, just look at farmers 300 million people were affected by Drought in last 2 years. farmers in India suffer from very high levels of malnutrition due to lack of awareness and low incomes.

Either we make a decision now or forever be condemn to 3rd or 2nd world status. I am going to get downvoted to hell for saying this here but Childfree is not a solution. You don't stop eating food when you weight 200 kilos. You cut down the diet, learn how to do it, get discipline about it and implement it in your life. Agreed, in this case, you won't see any quick results in 6 months but educating Indians about the evils of many kids will go a long way. People need to understand, giving birth to a lot of kids is never the solution. However, if someone has the capacity to raise kids, I believe, they should have/adopt as many as they can handle. If you are an educated person and marry someone with a good background, you can raise a kid who will be an asset to the world instead of a liability. Think about that before you pushing Childfree on everyone. Yes, it will take down population drastically but a lot of people will lead an extremely unhappy, miserable life. That is just we'll have to live with. The transition phase from parents depending on 3-4 kids to care for them in their old age to parents saving for themselves or depending on 1 kid at max would be difficult but inevitable. Middle class older people do have savings to take them through retirement, but poorer classes will find this especially difficult. Depopulation policy? What are you going to do? Send the police to raid the bedrooms You have raised very valid questions. The kids on this forum do not understand this and will argue the toss with you for the next 20 years but, well, they are kids. I should know. I had the same views till a few years ago.  
  
Heck, these kids are more intelligent and more humane than I was. I was thinking up ways to mass murder millions of people.  
  
Now coming back to your questions: These are questions to which even the developed world is seeking answers. So far their only solution is mass immigration. Remember Germany's willingness to take in millions of asylum seekers/economic migrants? Solution to the same problem.  
  
A little known news item was the Portuguese asking the asylum seekers / migrants to come to Portugal.  
  
China relaxing the one-child policy? Another attempt at solving the same problem.  
  
I have a lot of Chinese friends and colleagues and talk to them all the time. All of them, without exception, are consumed by this same issue: how to take care of aging parents. The problem sir is jobs. The population isn't a number. It's people. How do you manage aspirations of millions of people who've going to struggle to get jobs in an increasingly hostile market? [removed] [deleted] [removed] You and the rest of the overpopulation crowd have an understanding of economics that is profoundly lacking. 

Per Capita GDP is not some hokey dokey ratio you can just tweak. Population and GDP and the nuances they contain are profoundly linked together. Those GDP growth forecasts are including the growth provided by a growing population.  [deleted] >The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down. However, there's this problem: We have a lot old people, and the thing is they can't work. Especially a country like India, where there is huge population and on top of that: a huge old population. How are we going to give them pensions? Government would spend more than gain more? An old poor population isn't a very good incentive for FDI either. How are we going to tackle the massive grey population we have?

India doesn't have a huge old age population. Look the numbers [here](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2010.html#in)

We have almost 40% people in the most productive age group. We have 27% of our population which would be ready to be enter in workforce 10 years from now and upto 14 years after that even if we just stop to procreate anymore. I don't think managing India's old age population or providing for them would ever be a problem of India.

**RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot**

After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.


**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**

Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.

**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**

Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.

**Are Diamonds Forever?**

That’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**

In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.

",DexterMilburn," This thread series is my favorite of all and I feel like I should start something similar for civic issues and RTI.  1) the rio tinto mine goes through the panna national park area and I don't know how happy I am about that 

2) the sun Edison blew in the face man.  They bid aggressively in reverse auction in national solar parks which was paraded with so much galore, only knowing that it's pretty much not in tune with market price 

3) how's Tata Tiago? Thinking of buying a small car for mother  Bad loans being bought by ARCs... Sounds familiar. Precursor to new economic disasters to come? 
  
P.S. OP I love you Absolutely brilliant, but I used to enjoy your humor too.

Dude, you sometimes make ""it's vs its"" error. Submitted the survey too.  Thanks for the weekly update and quality reading as always. Just one suggestion - The equity index movements should be against previous week's end and this week's end rather than this week's open and end. 

Cheers, keep up the stellar work. Start email newsletter... For someone who has started to have interest in economics and social sciences, a must watch video - [How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)

 Great job /u/DexterMilburn. Just curious on how are you able to afford time and patience to do this. It takes lots of reading, squeezing, writing and then editing. How? Really nice thread, one of the most informative weekly posts on this subreddit. I just wanted to point out the fact that Tata Motors has launched 2 more cars between Nano and Tiago, Zest (sedan) and Bolt(hatchback).

I will add more. 

Some users pointed that there is no good journalism. But that's not right. There is a good journalism but we have to find it. I am creating these lists to help ourselves. As a conscious and educated citizens we have to be careful as much as we can. Sometime you can find a good article in the bad list and a poor article in the good list. Above lists are not strictly implying but providing a general idea for us to be careful. 
 ",Arjun_," So basically /r/india homepage should be avoided? /r/india I believe that if you're looking for a news source that's 100% unbiased, you won't find them. As well informed citizens and well adjusted people, the best we can do is read multiple sources of information and decide for ourselves where we stand on various political, social and economic issues...

I read both Kafila and Swarajya Mag. I form my own opinions and do not blindly take sides in politics. That's all.

Still, if I were you, I'd avoid all those new generation ""content creating"" websites that exist just to get more clicks and make profits from ad revenue. Examples would be: ScoopWhoop, DailyYo, Scroll, MensXP etc. tl;dr dont read anything Livemint is good journalism.  Should-read would make a shorter list.
Economic times is TOI minus the tabloid stuff.Washington post is a source I have always found to be balanced.For cultural perspective read the Hindu.Ignore it for economic stuff.Asia Pacific for defence and geopolitics. BC India ki toh koi site bachi hi nahin ab. All the sites that I know are there. The New York Times is good journalism? Kaunsi duniya mein bhaiyya? Their stories about India are generally trashy and look more like hit pieces than anything else. 

Also, as a ""right-aligned"" person, I find the Caravan excellent; their long-form pieces are pretty good. The Hindu, for all its left alignment, goes to great lengths to keep news and opinion separate. And their science and technology reporting is the best out there. For regular news too, your usual suspects (The Hindu, ToI, IE, HT, ET, NDTV, IBNLive) are fairly okay.

Among the newer publications, I quite enjoy reading Swarajya. They often publish articles by experts in various fields (Bibek Debroy, Syed Ata Hasnain, etc.) and other folks who either have several years of experience working in the fields they write about. Many of them wouldn't have found a voice in the regular mainstream media. The editing leaves much to be desired, but the content is quite alright. [deleted] well that's a huge fucking list. what are we supposed to read then? Add DNA India, The Logical Indian, Mili Gazette, Mid-day, The Statesman, Hindustan Times, New Indian Express, Daliyo, Story Pick to your list.

Edit: Outlook India and The Week Firstpost is the bane of existence. Everything from their news piece to movie reviews and political op-eds are based on sensationalism, so much so that sometimes they put TOI to shame. They are the self-proclaimed thought-leaders of new-age media, but with horrible taste for news. I especially hate their movie reviews; every snobbish mofo there is a wannabe Roger Ebert, with all talk but no substance. I don't know why people even read their stuff anymore.

Their general negativity was so repulsive that I unliked them from my fb to avoid their hateful feeds. There is no Good journalism. 

NYT is biased, India isn't its target yet. Guardian is relatively better but some of its guest editorials are down right moronic. 

Economist has a massive Anti-China bias, otherwise it has good content but one must never take it for good journalism.  
Same with TheDiplomat, massive anti-China bias.  

For domestic Chinese paper/mag, Caixin is best. I recommend reading http://www.thebetterindia.com and http://thealternative.in - Really good stories put out regularly. Add [project syndicate](http://www.project-syndicate.org/) too. You get great articles from highly qualified authors ranging from Jeffery Sachs, yanis varoufakis & Raghuram Rajan to Sashi Tharoor. There are rarely very long articles, but since most of the articles are by people who are some of the best in their respective fields, the quality is really good. wire scroll n fristpost Scroll.in, janatakareporter, firstpost, thewire.in, catch  Depends.

StartUp Beat Shanknaad pages and stories.  NitiCentral, OpIndia, TruthOfGujarat, CounterCurrents, indiasamvad.co.in, indiafacts.co.in  How is Indian express? The Telegraph is right wing, The Sun is a tabloid. Avoid anything from Rupert Murdoch. 

I read The Guardian but avoid their OP-ed posts. Oh I forgot Private Eye Magazine! They're consistently good & funny.

For Indian news, newslaundry seems alright so far.  [deleted] TOI website is actually quite good just they churn sheer numbers of news reports everyday some of them turn out to be shit but all in all they're quite neutral and good news source also add NYT and BBC in it because their India related news stories are heavily biased.

Edit - Dude NYT is not a good news source its the same paper which run the bullshit [Iraq has WMD stories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Miller) and in words of Noam Chomsky [NYT is pure propaganda](http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/noam_chomsky_the_new_york_times_is_pure_proganda_partner/). I like how entire publications can be written off by one user on an anonymous forum just saying two words. great work randia. truly

fwiw i agree with most of the OP's edited list I understand if a newspaper is biased towards a political idealogy that it manipulates news, then it should be considered bad source. 

But if the articles are well researched, should the alignment matter ?

Also few more to add to good reads list.

 * Newyorker (well researched long form articles)
 * The Atlantic (Entertaining, lacks substance, but good opinion pieces)
 * Granta (Good long form articles)

 I don't think any Indian newspaper left here which is considered good in randia. Reuters is a good source I like business standard.

I always found their news coverage to be adequate and relevant. Being a business newspaper, its coverage on personal finance, investing and observation of broad trends is good. Ignoring ultra biased Mihir Sharma, coverage of political news is minimal and mostly well grounded. Weekend issue has good lifestyle articles. You should certainly give it a chance. read the telegraph. really good paper, imo

for tech : android police is good, anandtech is good I would like to recommend Mint, Medianama and SpicyIP as sites that must be read. Also techcrunch? Seriously? I would recommend Recode and Anandtech instead. Also, could we please reclassify Newslaundry as media criticism + opinions instead of news?

Now coming to the political bias in the media mentioned in the first section. That is fine by me. I read them with the realization that they are biased just to get the view from the other side on several issue. I don't need to agree with ""them"" (the definition of them changes from topic to topic) or fight them; I just need to know how the other side thinks and feels about an issue. So do not restrict reading based on political biases. Bad clickbaity content  however should be avoided at all costs! That said, calling Buzzfeed clickbait becomes tricky as the news section has some good articles. http://www.buzzfeed.com/news You can say that Buzzfeed India is a bit clickbaity and they are unabashedly so.

PS: NDTV and IBN are yellow journalism? Do you even know what yellow journalism means? :D [deleted] Instead of targetting the negatives, can we have a list of good websites and blogs that do their niche thing or general thing (like news) While we're at it, can you guys tell me how do you prefer to read news on your smartphone? Used to read The Statesman when I was young. It was a great newspaper.

Surprised to see Caravan in the list of bad publications. It is easily the best article source I've ever read in India. It's features on Air India's destruction by Praful Patel, articles on the likes of Arvind Kejriwal, Arindam Chaudhary and Subramanium Swami were great.

The single greatest takedown of anyone I've read from an Indian source is this Caravan article on Suhel Seth.

http://www.caravanmagazine.in/books/age-seth Business Standard is a pretty good newspaper for financial news. Always found the articles well written; esp the opion pages.  India TV.  Good effort. Although it's usually a bad idea to eliminate major news sources. Know what their biases are and read different perspectives within reason. But obviously propaganda sources, govt mouth-pieces, tabloids, one-off blogs and social networks are really sketchy.

Good sources: 

International magazines/webzines: Economist (generally centrist, slightly right-wing economically) - it's not just a business magazine at least 50% is dedicated to international politics, Time (center-left), Salon (bit leftist).

BBC and Al-Jazeera get a lot of flak around here (""anti-india bias) but I've found most of their content excellent. Their documentaries are outstanding.

Vice (bit leftist) is a good documentary channel with a lot of current affairs.

Democracy Now is a good daily news broadcast, but sometimes a bit too leftist and conspiratorial.

John Oliver and Real Time with Bill Maher are good for US+intl politics, but remember they are comedy/satire shows. They're both pro-democrat.

From your current list, +1 for council for foreign relations and the diplomat. NYT, Atlantic are both great. Guardian is good, but some of their opinion pieces are occasionally absurdly left and sometimes borderline insane SJW territory.

Livemint is quite good (indian source, business news tilt). The Hindu, New Indian Express and The Telegraph are good newspapers with frequently excellent opinion pieces by guest authors.

I see a lot of people trashing Firstpost and scroll.in as being leftist. Like DailyO, these are a lot like blog aggregators, and it really depends on who is the author of the post you're looking at.

Sources to generally avoid:

 Most tabloids and almost everything with a conspiritard lean (ranging from globalresearch on the left to mediacrooks in india on the right). I'm not a fan of India today, in a lot of ways they try to sensationalize news and cater to what people want to hear. Times Now newshour is similarly just meant for entertainment, not a good source for anything. NTDTV, The Epoch Times, they are owned by Falungong, a religious cult, extremely biased against China. Add Zee news :P BBC for India related news is an atrocious source. The way they downplay incidents would bring tears of joy into the eyes of NDTV. What's left. I have no news sources now that I can use after seeing this list. :( Firstpost used to be the first site I check out each day. But stopped using their site completely some six months ago. Just sensational titles and complete bullshit in the articles. the indian express is both in the recommended list and in not recommended list Russia Today. It's basically a propaganda channel for the Kremlin.  firstpost.
Firstpost is not a real news paper.
It is just opinion in Trying to pretend to be better than other papers in use of English Language.
Scoopwoop.

4) jantakareporter

5) Kafila

6) Carvan

These all seem like some trash straight out of jhola of some JNU trash. The kind which wears kurta with chappals and drinks coffee in starbucks, gets drunk almost anywhere while abusing corporates


Among more mainstream:

1) TOIlet, is shit because all they know is to sell propaganda in guise of news.

2) The Hindu, so obvious left bias that it's not even funny. Pretends to be neutral, almost never accepts wrong reporting and in many cases, they just post whatever they can get away with. Their defence and science pages used to be nice. But haven't read the paper in years now.


3) Indian Express, Shekhar Gupta and Swamy are definitely on Paki payrolls. Manufacturing news like army coup to dishonour an upright general who firmly said no to corruption was just one of the lows this paper has gone to. Swamy is a perfect example of yellow journalism. Shiv Aroor when working for IE, routinely used to publish crap against armed forces, changed tone after leaving.


4) Hindustan Times, almost a complete Congress mouthpiece.




Among TV channels:

Any channel which employs Nidhi razdan, Barkha, Sardesai, Sagarika, Sreenivasan Jain and a couple of other soulless shameless turds of pressitutes. Includes NDTV, CNN-IBN and a few usual suspects.

 Thanks very much for this post! I raked up the courage to unfollow IBN and TOI from my Facebook. Personally speaking, they are sensational to the bone! Do add a few good media list too.  PRSIndia.org is good for legislation and parliamentary news. Is there any way to ban the websites reported here? by ban means not allowed to post on /r/india.

Over the past few years, I have become very jaded with computer science and engineering. Everytime I sit down to code for a job or assignment it feels like a meaningless task to me.  As a result, I find it tedious and I am not able to put in any effort that amounts to original work or learning. Computers have become boring to me! Moreover, I have developed cervical pain and think that I cant continue a career that requires me to sit in front of the computer all the time.

On the other hand, I have become more and more interested in the wider currents of the world covered in the social sciences like political economy or philosophy.

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/small-exporters-exempted-from-furnishing-bank-guarantee/articleshow/60886311.cms

I am a software professional working as an independent contractor for an overseas client. Last year 44ADA was introduced for professionals with income <50L. They need not even maintain records if they're paying tax on at least 50% of their total income and need not have any dependency on CAs. 

With GST, as per some CAs, to avail zero percent tax exemption for export of service we need to provide a bond with bank guarantee and file monthly GST returns. Most of us feel the need to hire a CA with an increased compliance and monthly fees burden.

I hope, in the time to come
1. minimum threshold for small export of services is kept at not less than 50L
2. if we still need to provide a bond there should be an option to generate and submit it online, so as to eliminate any physical interaction with the tax authorities
3. requirement of the bond, monthly GST return filing can also be eliminated for export of services (earnings at least below 50L), its affecting several s/w freelancers.

From short term perspective, does anyone know who are small exporters? At least I might not need a bank guarantee for now. I may still need to file monthly GST returns.  ",doero," Below 1 crore per annum I believe come under small exporters. > With GST, as per some CAs, to avail zero percent tax exemption for export of service we need to provide a bond with bank guarantee and file monthly GST returns.

"Now that Raghuram Rajan is leaving, let's talk about his replacement: The Monetary Policy Committee",153,4osapv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4osapv/now_that_raghuram_rajan_is_leaving_lets_talk/,40,"#Exit Raghuram Rajan, Enter Monetary Policy Committee

Now that Raghuram Rajan has resigned, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) of his own free will of course ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), it’s time to talk about his successor: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). You heard that right, a whole committee is set to replace him soon enough.

The media, at the moment, is filled with people sitting in two camps. One is mourning the loss of a great visionary central banker who was putting the ‘[sex back in the sensex](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-09-13/news/42041678_1_raghuram-rajan-rbi-guv-duvvuri-subbarao)’, while the other is excitedly discussing who is going to replace Rajan. 

> “Is it going to be Subramanian Swamy? That wily little fox has been planning it all along!”

> “Is it going to be Pahlaj Nihlani? He makes so many interesting cuts, probably he’ll be good at cutting interests too!”

> “Is it going to be Arundhati Bhattacharya? The first *woman* RBI chairman! That would sell, boyz, that would sell well indeed!”

> “Is it going to be Tanmay Bhat? He can then announce interest rate cuts over Snapchat. He’ll snap the economy in the Bhat and bring it back to shape!”

But what our dear media and ‘experts’ don’t seem to be talking about is the real replacement, the change of epic proportions that is going to happen to our central bank. So I present to you, the **Monetary Policy Committee**.

Don’t take *my* word for how important this is. RR makes a sly mention to this & the NPA problem in his [farewell letter](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=37259) too. All in one breath, squeezed between cryptic messages of being ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) forced to resign ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) as Governor of RBI.

> Inflation is in the target zone, **but the monetary policy committee that will set policy has yet to be formed**. Moreover, the bank clean up initiated under **the Asset Quality Review**, having already brought more credibility to bank balance sheets, **is still ongoing**. International developments also pose some risks in the short term.

___
#OK. RR is sexy and all. But n00b question: *What* does an RBI Governor do exactly?
___

Before we start talking about the big change, we should talk a little about what the job of the Reserve Bank of India Governor is. It would make it easier to explain the transition from Governor to MPC.

*(Check out /u/ribiy's comment: https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4osapv/now_that_raghuram_rajan_is_leaving_lets_talk/d4f7ll5. He explains this part more lucidly.)*

Think of the RBI as a big bank that lends to other smaller banks, those banks in turn lend to you. Commercial Banks *also* get their own money (through deposits) etc and then lend it to people (Thank you /u/MyselfWalrus). The Governor takes a call on what interest rate the RBI will charge to the banks they are lending to. In turn, those banks would add a tiny percentage of their own to that interest and give loans to people like you & me. The difference of interest rates between deposits & lending is where the banks make the profits, the central bank keeps control over how cheap or expensive loans in the market will be. The governor also sets the *Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)* for banks. That’s basically the amount of securities (Gold, bonds, assets) banks need to have to disburse loans of a proportional amount.

Apart from setting interest rates, he also is a sort of a Bank Manager. He keeps the machine running smoothly, so to speak. He also decides how much money is to be printed in what denominations. The Governor also gets to put his supercool signature on currency notes. He makes sure the cheques get cleared, fair exchange of funds happens between banks and basically keeps a watch on the banking sector through regular audits. 

The Governor is incharge of maintaining order in the foreign exchange market and making sure the country is working towards the goals set by the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). He also has the power to issue directions to banks, the recent one where he ordered a cleanup of balance sheets and declare Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). This is the **Asset Quality Review** that he mentioned in his farethewell letter as well. (Details about the NPA problem can be [read here](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/we-need-to-talk-about-our-banks))

Basically, the RBI governor gets to control how much money is floating around in the market. By increasing/decreasing interest rates, he can control spending within the market and feel like a finance god. The one single job of the RBI Governor over the past few years is to resist the pressure of successive governments & reduce interest rates too much. 

Or, at least, that is the part of his job that gets him in the news.

___
#OK. So the RBI Governor is an epic Finance God that gets to screw the government over, right? RIGHT?
___
Hey now! That’s harsh!

The Governor actually has a job of ensuring economic stability. He/she (‘she’ because now that’s possible!) is supposed to think long-term, ensure that the citizens don’t go on an insane spending spree and create artificial financial bubbles that will burst later and bite ‘em in the a. (Eg: The 2008 Housing Mortgage crisis in the US)

The Government, on the other hand, is a creature with a life of 5 years. In those five years, they are desperately trying to woo the voters and get them to vote for the same political party in the next election. What would make people happier than having more money to spend, ergo cheaper and more accessible loans! 

The government of the day will keep asking the RBI Governor to lower interest rates so that there is more money flooded in the market (""Bubbles? What bubbles? We'll deal with them *if* they burst""). The RBI Governor refuses most of the time because propping up an economy on the shoulders of a creature called ‘debt’ is… well… a TERRIBLE idea.

*Well, whatdoyaknow, that’s all about to change!*

___
#Alrighty then! Tell me about the big ‘change’.
___
[The Finance Bill, 2016](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2016-17/fb/bill.pdf), which was passed in the last budget session of Parliament, had a [controversial amendment to the FCRA act \(Clause 233\)](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/last-week-in-parliament) that allowed foreign funding to political parties. But but but, it had another amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act (Clauses 216 to 220), which created this entity called the “Monetary Policy Committee”.

Earlier, the Governor was the whole & sole authority to decide interest rates. He could veto anything that he thought doesn’t benefit the Indian economy. It was a dictatorship and there was no way around it. Now, the MPC will be the one setting rates and making fiscal policies for the country.

The MPC will have six members, three from the RBI and three ‘eminent personalities’ appointed by the central government. The RBI peeps will consist of the Governor (Chairman), Deputy Governor & one officer nominated by the RBI central board. The 3 ‘personalities’ will be selected for a period of four years by [the following people](http://imgur.com/2ZTbQRm). 

Each member gets one vote. If there is a tie, [the RBI Governor gets the casting vote](http://imgur.com/xJT8Hi8).

Every member has to give a written statement explaining why they voted in favour/against a resolution. However, all proceedings of the Monetary Policy Committee [shall remain confidential](http://imgur.com/NtBtUkW).

These are the *bare bone facts* that I have presented to you. You can interpret it in whatever way you want. I am going to go ahead and give my take on it.

____
#Democratic way of functioning
___

Most global banks have this process of having a committee to decide rate and monetary policies. In the US, the Federal Open Market Committee has seven board members, all of whom are appointed by the President for a period of 14 years. In England, the MPC has nine members (5 from the Bank of England and 4 appointed by the Minister of Finance).

In India, the debate for forming an MPC began in February 2014. The RBI, back then, recommended that this committee should have Five members (Three from RBI and Two Government appointed). In 2015, the Government recommended that the committee should have Seven members (Four Govt. appointed and Three from the RBI). After much haggling and powerplay, they seem to have reached a compromise with equal number of members from both sides. 

Jaitley mentioned in the Lok Sabha during the Finance Bill 2016 debate that this MPC was formed in consultation with the RBI, so itsallgood. 

**Or is it?**

Earlier the Governor was incharge of making the right call. He was solely responsible for any bad decisions that he takes and the economy suffers as a result. So it also meant that the Governor was that much careful before lowering interest rates or taking any major steps. Now, there’s a committee in place, the responsibility of the decisions taken would be *diluted* between six people. ([Shared Responsibility](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/))

Let’s assume a scenario where there is a resolution in place to lower the interest rate. Three people (government appointees) vote in favour and the other three (RBI appointees including the Governor) vote against. It's a tie. Now the governor gets a casting vote. Logically, the governor would vote against, keeping in line with his first vote.

But what if he/she decides to vote in favour? What would that exactly mean, in terms of attributing responsibility for making bad decisions? There is always the factor that the new governor would be someone who totally favors the Government and takes decisions based on only their recommendations. 

Or worse, takes decisions to *be in the favour* of the Government.

EDIT: Corrections as suggested by /u/myselfwalrus

EDIT2: Added /r/ribiy's comment to the Original post.

EDIT3: /u/ngotha made [some valid points](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4osapv/now_that_raghuram_rajan_is_leaving_lets_talk/d4f8y1s). Adding a summation:

- RR was in favour of the MPC model. What he wasn't in favour was the composition of the committee. (/u/DARKKKKIS [gave a link](http://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-very-happy-with-composition-of-monetary-policy-committee/articleshow/51372691.cms) for the same)

- The composition has since been changed to the present version.

- You can't have a Nihlani or Sharma as the govt nominees because the Committee also mentions the selection process for these people. It will be done by an external panel which includes the RBI Governor.",kumbhakaran," 3-3 is only a theoretical balance. It will never happen in practice. Deputy-Governer will never disagree with government's line since his likely promotion depends on Government's grace. I expect RBI to become a total rubber stamp. Governer will become a scape-goat if anything bad happenes. You miss out a couple of points or at least it's very misleading. 

The MPC is not a replacement for the RBI governor, the MPC would help set  iinterest rates (which as you briefly mentioned, is how a lot of the central banks around the world function), but the RBI has quite a few other tasks to perform. 

Second, you make no mention that the greatest Indian since Buddha, RR was in favour of the MPC model, someone has even posted links here which you might want to peruse. What he wasn't in favour was the composition of the committee, which has since gone through a change to his satisfaction. 

 Here is the fun part, the idea of an MPC came not from the dictatorial Modiji govt but from a UPA appointed technocrat named Urjit Patel, the deputy governor (Oxford, Yale, London Uni, IMF alumnus, so maybe not as talented as the greatest Indian since Buddha, but reasonably so), you can find a copy of his findings [here](https://m.rbi.org.in//Scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?ID=743). 

So the summary is, a UPA appointed the Deputy Governor and the governor who formed a committee to look at reform in the RBI who inturn suggested the MPC, which is not a replacement for the greatest Indian since Buddha. Also you can't have a Nihlani or Sharma as the govt nominees because the Committee also has mentioned the selection process for these people and one is that it us by an external panel which incidentally has the Governor in it. 

It might be more accurate if your post reflects some of these points.  Rajan has heavily favoured MPC. 

http://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-very-happy-with-composition-of-monetary-policy-committee/articleshow/51372691.cms He has not resigned from his post. He is still the RBI Governor till his term ends in September, he has decided against seeking a second term. Also the MPC is not a replacement to the RBI governor. The MPC will decide the monetary policy and the RBI governor is a member of the committee with a casting vote. 

The RBI also doesn't lend to banks for further lending, the banks are supposed to raise their own funds through deposits/loans/bonds. The RBI only lend short-term for banks to meet their statutory requirements (CRR, SLR). They also provide funds for upto 180 days against promissory notes issued by banks for loans against export bills. quality post 
 hey man, thanks for this. As someone who doesn't watch TV(and by that extension news) and doesn't follow any news in general(hate news), I rarely have idea about what happens when and where, especially regarding policy changes and other stuff in India. Thanks for the write-ups about these stuff, really appreciate it. Don't worry, you are not the only source of my info about these stuff, I do read up elsewhere on it on my own, to have an unbiased opinion.  >Or worse, takes decisions to be in the favour of the Government.

It's pretty obvious, they're gonna find someone who they can use as a stooge or atleast shares the same views on economic policies as they do. SriSri would make a good candidate i suppose.

https://twitter.com/srisri/status/446718696459730944 > Think of the RBI as a big bank that lends to other smaller banks, those banks in turn lend to you. The Governor takes a call on what interest rate the RBI will charge to the banks they are lending to. In turn, those banks would add a tiny percentage of their own to that interest and peddle loans to people like you & me.    

This is absolutely misleading. For the most part, Banks get their own money (through deposits) etc and then lend it to people like you and me.

About IndiaSpend:

IndiaSpend is the country’s first data journalism initiative. We use data to tell stories with the broader objective of improving the quality of public discourse. IndiaSpend was founded in late 2011 by Govindraj Ethiraj. IndiaSpend is increasingly an `agency of record’ when it comes to data and facts on the Indian economy, particularly in areas like education, healthcare, environment, energy and gender.

IndiaSpend is a non-profit and a project of The Spending & Policy Research Foundation located in Lower Parel in Mumbai, and registered as a Charitable Trust with the Charity Commissioner, Mumbai. 

Govindraj Ethiraj, Founder: He is a television & print journalist and also Founder of PING Digital Network, a next generation digital television initiative. He also anchors seasonal shows on Indian news television – the current one being the weekly `Policy Watch’ on public service broadcaster Rajya Sabha or RS TV. And most recent being BottomLine on Headlines Today – and writes for newspapers like Business Standard.

Previously, he was Founder-Editor in Chief of Bloomberg TV India. Prior to setting up Bloomberg TV India, he worked with Business Standard newspaper as Editor (New Media) with a specific mandate of integrating the newspaper’s news operations with its digital or web platform. He also spent around five years each with CNBC-TV18 & The Economic Times. He is a Fellow of The Aspen Institute, Colorado & a winner of the BMW Foundation Responsible Leadership Awards for 2014.

Samar Halarnkar, Editor: A journalist for 24 years working at publications like the Indian Express and India Today. His last assignment was Managing Editor of Hindustan Times, where he revamped the nationwide flow of news to focus on issues of public interest and ran groundbreaking investigations into poverty related multibillion-dollar subsidy programmes and administrative reform.

He continues as a columnist with Hindustan Times and Mint, writing on social and economic issues, science and technology. Most recently, he was a fellow with the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University, where he drew up a blueprint for mobile-phone-based, public-interest journalism model for India. He has also been a visiting professor at the University of California-Berkeley.

Halarnkar is the author of two books, “Nirvana under the rain tree”, an early chronicle of India’s Internet Revolution, and “A married man’s guide to creative cooking (and other dubious adventures)”, his experiments with cooking, which flowed out of a popular cooking column that he continues to write. He is married with a four-year-old daughter and lives in Bangalore.

",govindrajethiraj," Hi Govindraj and Samar. Thanks for doing this. 

I wanted to ask about this particular story IndiaSpend did on Delhi pollution which appeared in HT - [""Delhi’s pollution one-and-half times worse than Beijing""](http://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-pollution-one-and-half-times-worse-than-beijing/story-zGXWaA0sMG3nwTEeU59SaP.html). Apparently it was based on ONE data point in Delhi and ONE data point in Beijing.

> The analysis is based on a comparison of data generated by IndiaSpend’s #Breathe air quality monitoring sensor placed at RK Puram, Delhi with the one placed by the US government in its embassy at Beijing.

Don't you think the data analysis here is incomplete, and the headline is ""flawed"". The same flawed analysis was [picked up](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/beijing-pollution-smog-air-quality-environment-delhi-india-china-a6768611.html) by The Independent among others. [deleted] From painful experience - quality data sets on india are hard to come by. How (if at all) does this impact your work and what steps do you take to combat it.

Doesn't this limit the scope of DJ ?

What do you use/how do you guys clean and prep your data? Thank you all for your insightful questions and encouraging feedback...we will answer any further questions tomorrow morning by 10:00 AM IST [deleted] Hello! Thanks for doing this AMA  
1. What is one biggest misconception that you cleared, that you think is the most significant/interesting  
2.  What do you think of the current GDP calculation exercise?  
3. Do you have any suggestion to improve the way elections are reported and analysed?  
4. Which is the one area (in India ) where data journalism is needed the most?   
 Welcome! 

I'm sorry I can't articulate this question very well and I might be getting it all wrong, but - In your opinion in general, do you find that Indian systems of business commentary/think tanks/political commentary have started closely mirroring US structures? for eg. we see in US think tanks funded by special interest groups or with specific conservative or corporatist bents that produce analysis to the advantage of certain interests. do you see that happening in India too? Props for the #Breath initiative to monitor pollution levels in the country, its what inspired me and a friend to make [Earth Map](http://ocsidlab.github.io/earthmap/#4/21.15/79.08) on world environment day. Was very impressed to find open data and well documented APIs for this data. IndiaSpend is an awesome initiative! I hope other newspapers also follow the suit and do more data journalism. I do have some questions:

1) If I want to do data journalism, what is the path that you recommend, considering that I don't have any background in journalism, but I do work in the data analytics area.

2) Do you accept outside contributions for articles? Obviously after editorial review.

3) What tools do you guys use internally to do analysis?

4) Do you guys do any follow up research on the articles that you publish, and do some academic publishing?

5) Do you always use publicly available data sources like data.gov.in, or do you guys also file RTI requests?

Thanks for doing this, and in general for India Spend. Do you find any particular areas/sectors, in which getting relevant data is particularly hard? Really love IndiaSpend,

I really don't like the Indian Media as it is today, more sensationalism than substance, giving wide coverage to things that are not at all of national importance.

Indian Media should not be like 1st world country Media, because India is not 1st world country. Their priorities are different, while India faces massive 3rd world problems like Poverty, illiteracy, Malnutrition, quality Education, Urbanization etc., on a scale like no other country. Why does Mainstream Media cover Business so little when India is rapidly becoming a Market Economy.

Should media hold accountable on Policy issues with respective ministers and state Govt's rather than tit-for-tat silly politics, should Media work in nationalist interest because India faces such grave problems. what's your take on Media coverage of issues that's really matter. Are you hiring? Why is it named IndiaSpend? First of all thanks for doing this. I've read many of your pieces over the years and your data driven approach to journalism is quite refreshing in the present landscape. 

I have a few questions:

1. I'll be very honest. Most India spend articles I read are on other sites like Scroll etc. And I'm guessing they pick up stories which their editorial team thinks is the most relevant to their readers. Does cross publishing help readers discover your platform or is it harmful to the bottomline?


2. How difficult is it in our country to reach the masses with a purely data driven approach to journalism? Do you deliberately attempt to ""dumb down"" jargon or is that a strict no-no?


3. The risk with any data is that it can be interpreted variously by different people. Is it therefore difficult to maintain objectivity regarding conclusions you draw from data and how do you make sure that you stay away from ""I'm seeing what I want to see in the data"" kind of reportage? Really appreciate your efforts to clear up the ambiguity about lot of issues impacting us. 

1. What are some constructive ways your data has been used in?

2. What data surprised you the most and shattered common perceptions in that area? 


 First of all thanks for the wonderful initiative. I have 3 questions.  
1. How difficult to get right data as our system is not much supportive in collecting data ? What is the most difficult part ?  
2. How difficult is to remain unbiased while reporting issues ?  
3. Any particular case where the data based journalism has made major impact ?   I really have nothing worthwhile to ask at the moment(lots of good suggestions and questions already here) but i just want to say, *Thank You Guys* for what you are doing. Its appreciated immensely.  
We need this type of Facts-Only media journalism.  
Unfortunately we live in a world of Narrative/Story-based media journalism era, which is inherently prone to bias by its very design.  

I hope you set up a plan to safeguard your future revenue streams because being donations driven doesn't seem like a future proof plan to me. I hope you guys can sort this vulnerability in your project.  

All the best.  [removed]",Policy/Economy,2016-09-02 19:30:00

"Why Rao is considered so Chankyan, a brief into into the 91 reforms",129,3lnf6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3lnf6a/why_rao_is_considered_so_chankyan_a_brief_into/,109,"The narrative about our BOP crisis today largely seems to be, India was almost bankrupt (true), IMF handed MMS (and Rao) a list of reforms, reforms passed, huzzzah!

The reality is very very different from this narrative. In reality, PVN had these massive issues to overcome,

* A minority govt
* A very partisan opposition (even more so than today). Atleast today the plank is supposedly 'development', back then it was all about ""garibi hatao"", ""support our PSU's to the death"". 
* Look at the seat strength the opposition had - JD+CPI held 102 seats, the BJP 120. These two combined alone could defeat any motion.

If you think the UPA had it tough, and the NDA has it tough today...think again. PVn had a minority govt, had to hardsell 'reforms' which were a very very dirty word back then, had to fight deeply vested interests. If we are a crony capitalist state today, in 1990, it was pretty much open house. Rules and policies were made by the Dhirubhai's.

How did he do all this? Read on,

To be fair to Rao, he was not a great economist, heck he was barely an economist, but he played the political game very well. He for instance put forth the idea of liberalising a very vocal sector (say mines), and then promptly backtrack (As though he was surrendering) and putting in its place a more...milder reform.

Look at how...spectacularly he played the New Industrial Policy of 91. It was a breathtaking move (for India) in that it virtually did away with Nehruvian era relics of licensing and control for industries. It could have boomeranged on him, so what does the sly fox do? Announce it the exact same day (At around 4 PM, to ensure it made the next days print news) of the budget for 91.

What did it look like? Mr MMS passed this reform. If it did boomerang? Who could be sacrificed? FUCK! I mean, you look at all this and you have to admire the sheer political statecraft of this wily old fox.

Look at broadly how well he handled this whole reform process? He first announced a broad slew of measures (to shut the IMF up), and then promptly delayed the introduction of bills or overall went very slow in actually bringing these into action. And then the rolling thunder movement, hit one broad policy front with mild reforms. Wait for fall out, quell it (with outright bribery if needed) and introduce a marginally more...powerful reform. On and on it went.

One thing he never did was pick a battle he knew he would lose. So he never went after the big PSU's, never the big vested interests, never the farm or social welfare schemes. He brilliantly picked the battles he knew he would win. He admired Willy Brandt and modelled himself on this other wily old fox.

The final piece of the puzzle! Despite being a politician, he never openly spoke about the reforms nor his overall aims. This kept everybody guessing and confused and he basically was free to do as he wished.  I think his brilliance can be explained simply by saying something he used to say often ""delaying or not taking a decision in itself was a decision"". This is most evident in the way he handled (again, quite spectacularly) the Fertilizer crisis. He had to reduce the fertilizer subsidies, but it was (and still is) a political hot potato. So what does the fox do? Again, push it via MMS, and when the shit storm hit, MMS ""offered his resignation"" which the fox graciously refused, AND then he sets up a committe, which mollifies the protestors, and then he passes the reforms with a 10% cut from the original increase.

I mean, this level of political guile and statecraft is just astonishing.

It is a fucking pity he didn't have a govt with absolute majority in the LS or that he didn't get a second term (sadly he was a Gandhi loyalist to a fault). If he had...

Not even touching the deft political moves, I mean this guy played all spectrums like it was a violin. Left? Check (V P Singh's faves, Montek Singh & Rakesh Mohan were his key advisors). BJP? Check. There is always this dark speculation though that he allowed Babri Masjid to be taken down, with the trade off that the BJP support his reforms, but this is and will remain unfounded speculation. He really was a supreme political master, and without him, not a single reform would have been passed.

I must point out, was he some sort of angel or something? No. He maybe was personally corrupt (we don't know), he associated with, nay was intimately associated with a deep rat bastard like Chandraswami. PVN had his flaws, but that shouldn't take away from his monumental achievements.

Why was the 91 budget so...landmark? Here are some top reasons why,

* Rupee was devalued, and devalued again.
* New trade policy favouring exporters (a bad word in the maai-baap socialistic model of Indira and Rajiv...not Nehru)
* Dismantled the license raj
* Put forth an austerity budget (before it was cool) and aimed straight away to cut deficit by 3-4% points.
* He near abolished export subsidies

[Further reading into the nature of the reforms, and just how fucked up our economy was in the 80's](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2004/wp0443.pdf)

",RajaRajaC," I always argue that PVNR is not given enough credits (may be cause he did not have the right surname or the right leanings) and that MMS is given too much credit for the 91 crisis handling.

Do share more reading material especially historical and political analysis of the period. Another thing people forget is that '91 was not the first time reforms were tried. Indira Gandhi in '66 and Rajiv Gandhi from '85-'87 had also tried some reforms. Indira Gandhi had to roll back pretty much all of those and adopt the socialist line because of two reasons: 1) She was at that point weak inside the congress party, with the ""Syndicate"" (Morarji Desai and Co.) commanding significant power and trying to control her, and the ""Non-syndicate"" younger faction from who she was courting support were mostly socialists  2) There was a backlash against the reforms from various sections, and her performance suffered in the '67 elections as a result.

Good source on Indira Gandhi's financial flip flop from right to left: http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1071&context=political_science_facpub

Rajiv Gandhi too faced a significant backlash, but he only rolled back part of his reforms. He is of course best known for telecom sector reforms. 


The genius of the MMS/Rao team was to get their policies implemented. It seems to me that you are bitter against MMS (I can guess why) but he too deserves a lot of the credit, he wasn't purely a technocrat as he is made out to be.  India was in deep crap in early 90s

Kashmir was in open rebellion.

Punjab was burning

NE was a cauldron of violence and separatists

Babri issue and communal violence was at it's highest

Ltte was trying to rally Tamils in TN against Indian Government

Economy was in ICU

Soviet Union: India's largest backer had collapsed

Pakistan had got support of West as it helped in thwarting Soviets in Afghanistan and also received massive funds from Arabs and China

Massive protests both for and againt Mandal Commission. 

Anti India govt in many neighbours. 

 deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2767  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/84601) The biggest obstacle for him was his own party. Most of the old socialist MPs were deeply suspicious of the PVNR govt. Also, the leaders were really shitty back in the day. Devi Lal, Chautala, Sharad Yadav... yuck.

Its almost a miracle we survived.

But it's really sad both UPA & NDA now don't have the guile to get shit done. A lot of hot air and nothing else. I would really like to read more about Rao and his time in office.

Any good books that speak authoritatively and fairly about him?

**Edit:** Btw, let it be known that PVNR was gult. You're welcome :) Social condition was also tough back then. India was at verge of becoming Pakistan like radical country (thanks to Indian voters back then who did not vote for Hindutvawadis).  Super thanks for this. I had no idea what the political situation was like at that time Since PVN was not from Gandhi political family ,he isn't been given any credit for his work.He actually was the best prime minster India ever had and we would have gotten screwed if he wasn't the PM during those crises.
Also read how he avoided sanction by Un/oic by asking iran's help and sending the foreign minister to deliver the letter to Iranians even though the foreign minister was pretty much on his death bed. Frank underwood of Indian politics. While PVNR was good. I do not think that undermines MMSs work. A good leader helps their exceptional talent shine. But they do need that talent. Biggest example of this is our cricket team. 
Dhoni was great leader but he worked with great team. So was Ganguly. Not taking away their leadership qualities but we cannot undermine work of Kumble, Lakshman, Dravid, Tendulkar.
Everyone should get their share of respect, no use praising one to undermine the other. People tend to think that Modi come at a difficult time should compare the time when PVNR came to power India was a literally a cluster-fuck back then i mean economy was in tatters, Kashmir was facing a worst ever urgency, Punjab was still struggling with militancy, all that Mandal commission Fuckery was very much alive and religious divide was at all time high and he even heading a minority government successfully completed a full 5 year term which is truly a  remarkable thing indeed.  Sometimes you need evil ppl in charge to beat the other evil ppl, you dont send a rat into a snake pit, you send a python. > Chankyan

Is this a Tamil expression or did you mean to write Chanakyan? You missed opposition to reforms within the very divided congress party itself. Also, if he was a gandhi dynasty loyalist why was he treated so unfairly aftermath his death and in the days preceding to it?

He is the hero we needed, not the one we deserved. >So what does the fox do? Again, push it via MMS, and when the shit storm hit, MMS ""offered his resignation"" which the fox graciously refused

Not really. MMS by nature was a sensitive and introverted academic who did not know politics. So each time he introduced a reform and the opposition and critics bayed for his blood, he could not genuinely take it, and offered resignations a total of three times during the period. Only after much persuasion from PVN to not take criticism personally did he start accepting it.  RRC, how the fuck did your piece get construed as a belittling of MMS?

The fuck? Rao was also

* Home Minister during 1984, during which one of the worst riots in modern India happened.
* Coal blocks (India's largest scam to date) from 1993 to 2014 were cancelled by the SC. Which means the coal scam originally started with Rao and was continued by successive governments (including BJP).
* Wanted nuclear tests but was strong armed by US into not doing it which probably set our energy policy back decades and responsible for our energy shortage. Vajpayee actually made this an election issue and rode the nationalism wave on this.

Honestly, I don't see Rao being a better PM than Nehru. Indira Gandhi (and then Rajiv through his incompetence, though his direction was mostly right) fucked up the Indian economy, not Nehru. Nehru's policies were right for the time and we would have been far worse if someone like Bose has been the leader of the country. I'd still place Rao in the top 3 PMs of modern India and MMS and Indira Gandhi at the bottom (discounting short term clusterfuck PMs  such as VP Singh and Gujral) There is a sudden interest in Rao, because of him not being from the Gandhi family and BJP generally wanting to downplay the family.. but the fact of the matter is, we came through this mess because of sheer brilliance of Manmohan Singh. 

My dad was working at a decently senior position at SBI. Everyone was shitting bricks about the impending doom, before Manmohan Singh came up with a credible plan.

And the shit got passed in the parliament, because of the high professional integrity of Manmohan Singh and leaders believed what he said.

MMS might have been a shitty leader, but one of the brilliant economic minds India has ever seen. > JD+CPI held 102 seats, the BJP 120. These two combined alone could defeat any motion.

BJP had some reservations but they were supporting the reforms. OP, I dont know how many of randians has seen days where

1) 2 tv channels (DD and DD 2)

2) getting a mtnl line required waiting

3) you get a passport and the postman will ask for bakshish

4) nationalized bank people treat you like shit. The attitude hasnt changed much on their part. People now hit back.

5) ambassador and fiat cars, hmt watches, air india, indian airlines, custom notified shops (to buy imported stuff)

While we should have gone the market driven model, we went soviet style where everything is controlled by the state. 

That was the 1st biggest mistake no one talks about.

I see Swamy talking about it. Do you have any info on his contributions from sources other than what he says? [removed] And what is your opinion of MMS' role in the liberalisation of the Indian economy? Don't forget - on being made PM, he *chose* to take up the Industrial ministry. He didn't give it to anyone else. Being industrial minister, he could roll out the reforms and didn't need anyone elses stamp or any secretary to pass it to the PMO. :) You missed this!

"[AskIndia] Is India on its way to becoming a Fascist nation, or is it already one?",27,5ectir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ectir/askindia_is_india_on_its_way_to_becoming_a/,43,"Umberto Eco, a famous author who lived under the fascist regimes of World War 2 Italy, once listed 14 features of Fascism. Reading [that list on open culture](http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html) got me thinking about how a lot of people throw around the F-word when referring to modern India, and I figured that r/india would have answers for this.

Two caveats. One, I'm as biased as you are regarding where and how I get my news, so maybe I've been hearing Fascist, while you're hearing Reformist. Two, I don't actually have any proof that says that this list is definitive proof of fascism. It's Umberto Eco's opinion, and if you take issue with it, feel free to go spit on his grave.

Here's the list:

> 1. The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”

> 2. The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”

> 3. The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”

> 4. Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”

> 5. Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”

> 6. Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”

> 7. The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”

> 8. The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”

> 9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”

> 10. Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”

> 11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.""

> 12. Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”

> 13. Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”

> 14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”


What I'm taking away from this mostly pointless exercse, is that Indian society is quite susceptible to Umberto Eco's model of Fascism, largely due to its deference to tradition, a lack of cultural identity and a burgeoning middle class.

EDIT: Since a lot of people seem to be confused about this. Wikipasta for Fascist beliefs below.

> Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete, and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature, and views political violence, war, and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.",won_tolla," If you have been noticing, ever since the 2008 economic crisis the whole world has been moving to the right. We had minor EU nations embrace neo-fascism in their governments and now the bigger nations around the world are sympathetic to fascist ideology.  even if we take this list as gospel, it would be an overreaction to say we are on our way to fascism.

2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 from the list do not apply in the remotest to us. It's hilarious that almost all those points are true for America too. America is Fascist? Baba all firangi models fail in India.

You are being a little paranoid. Keep Calm and move on ! Do an experiment. 

Go to nearest village which is not exposed to reddit. You will get the following:

* heroism
* conspiracy
* machismo
* contempt for weak
* xenophobia
* rejection of modernism
* cult of tradition
* disagreement is treason

I can describe 

* each religion in the above terms
* each heirloom and long running dynasties
* each political party
* Occupy Wallstreet movement
* Bring back democrats movement

in the same points.

 nah dude, fascism requires some kind of discipline, not possible in India. If you have no idea of a fascist nation you should talk to people who actually have lived in one. What you said isn't applicable in India and you should feel bad about it.  [deleted] Interesting read.

Going by this list, the current govt ticks quite a few boxes. Hoping for a course correction...

Also how to move phonepe to another (new) phone? Just do sim verification again? This is being advocated because swiping cards is risky etc - correct? Bank of India

**Apple’s New China Is India**

When Steve Jobs, ex-hippie and the founder of Apple, visited India in the 1970s, he wore a lungi and [roamed](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/what-steve-jobs-did-in-india-35-years-ago-225246) barefoot. Until, of course, the Indian national disease of diarrhea cut his trip short and sent him back to the US. Fortunately for all of us, when Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, visited India last week his attire did not include a lungi and he probably drank bottled water, as is tradition for all foreign tourists in India. In between wild Bollywood parties at SRK’s house and IPL matches in Kanpur, Tim [announced](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-tim-cook-samples-bollywood-cricket-in-bid-to-woo-india-1463822223) a startup accelerator in Bengaluru and the opening of two new offices including one in Hyderabad. It wasn’t all play and no work - Tim met with businessmen like the CEOs of ICICI Bank, Vodafone India, TCS and heads of state like Prime Minister Modi, the Telangana CM and many more. But why India and why now? After reporting the first quarterly decline in sales that was largely caused due to slowing growth in China, Apple is now searching for something other than China to fuel growth for the coming decade. And Apple’s next China might just be India. Tim termed his visit to India as ‘fantastic’ but then again, he also ran into Alia Bhatt. So it’s entirely possible that his statements were laced with sarcasm.  

**The One With Trump, Brexit and India**

Britain, the former colonial master of India and more countries than you can even name, is going through an independence movement of its own. Currently, the country is a part of the European Union, a political and economic union of 28 countries in Europe. In a public vote to be held on June 23rd, Britishers will decide if the nation will stay in the European Union or get out of the European Union. All of that may be Britain’s headache but a new report out of SBI [suggests](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-brexit-can-open-up-opportunities-for-india-sbi-research-report-2212552) that even though a Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) could be terrible for Europe, it could turn out to be hugely beneficial for India since Indian companies will no longer need to follow complex trade agreements while dealing with Britain. Likewise, a former US Diplomat says a Trump presidency in the US, while [terrible](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/if-donald-trump-becomes-us-president-india-may-gain-at-chinas-expense-heres-why/articleshow/52380459.cms) for China and Pakistan (...not to mention Mexico) might actually turn out to be great for India as ~~Donald Trump~~ Dear Leader’s foreign policies are likely to shift the balance of power in Asia in favour of India. The word to describe what you’re feeling right now is schadenfreude - taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Trust me, *I know words. I have the best [words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T-Eo0j092Q)*

**The Banking Bloodbath**

With the whole bad loans crisis being shoved in everyone’s faces, it’s no surprise that banks are feeling the heat. Saddled with a ton of losses caused by increasing net non-performing assets (the fancy term for bad loans), conditions are becoming dire. A host of smaller banks reported earnings last week and it’s not good. If you have a phobia of falling bank profits, turn away now and seek professional help because it’s about to get gruesome. Alright, [here](http://www.livemint.com/Money/1MpJ5uNbQXhacOWKTo3PWJ/PSU-banks-shares-fall-after-weak-earnings.html) we go: Dena Bank reported a loss of ₹326 crore, Allahabad Bank reported a loss of ₹581 crore, Central Bank of India reported a loss of ₹898 crore, UCO Bank reported a loss of ₹1,715 crore and Syndicate Bank [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/syndicate-bank-q4-loss-at-rs-2158cr-provisions-jump-3-fold_6677621.html) a loss of ₹2,158 crore. Going for the silver medal is Bank of Baroda with a loss of ₹3,230 crore, the second highest loss in the history of Indian banking. And now, for the gold medal, the worst loss in the history of Indian banking ever was reported at a record-breaking ₹5,367 crore by *drumroll* Punjab National Bank. It feels good to have found the rock-bottom at last. At least now, there is nowhere to go but up. That’s what investors in bank stocks are saying to themselves so they can sleep well at night. Let’s hope for their sake that we don’t find a new bottom in the next quarter.

**|| || || > | | | | | |**

So you might’ve heard: The banking industry is in a bit of a tight spot. There haven’t been any bankruptcies (phew) yet. But there’s blood on the streets. And the only way to patch the wound is to stick together in times of trouble. State Bank of India, one of the largest banks in India, [proposed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-bank-of-india-says-no-talks-on-merging-with-any-other-lenders-1408323) a plan to stick together and merge with its 5 associate banks: State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore plus the newly created Bharatiya Mahila Bank. If merged, the combined bank will become a banking behemoth with 50 crore customers. And behemoths don’t bleed easy. Taking cue, the government is also urging UCO Bank, Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank (all of whom have reported losses) to find themselves a relatively well off bank and merge their losses away. Playing the merger game is tricky business. You don’t want your merger to be like Romeo and Juliet. Sure, they made history but they both died in the end. You want your merger to be like Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. One that can live happily ever after.

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, however has in the past suggested that the highest salary paid in a company shouldn’t be more than 25 times the lowest salary paid in the company.

* Vijay Mallya, who has indirectly paid the salaries of thousands of journalists around the world along with Donald Trump, is scared. He’s scared that Indians will come after him with pitchforks if he ever returns from the UK. Accordingly, Mallya [says](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vijay-mallya-fugitive-businessman-consider-india-return-if-safety-freedom-assured-1560279) he’ll only return if his safety and freedom is assured. GOI’s formal request to the British government to extradite Mallya was declined. More problems to boot: A ₹2.4 crore dividend payable to Mallya from United Breweries was withheld.

Thank you, good sir. Until next week! (: you do have the best, best words.

props to you man. this is great writing. you should pitch this to the Economist. They'd love it That's one of the most helpful posts, I have seen on Reddit. Keep it up!!! EU is not a political union, it is an economic union though.

In economic union you have monetary union in shape of ECB.

EU is walking towards political union and when it will be a political union then its working will be somewhat same as United States of America (USA). Excellent as always
 Please don't support Trump, regardless of the theorized potential economic benefits.  
  
-your dear friend in America far from me to be pedantic but the word ""extradited"" sticks out like a store in the Mallya story. Actually, the govt requested that Mallya be ""Deported"" which is a quick and painless procedure. This was declined as the UK has a policy of not deporting anyone who has landed there legally. The British suggested that if India requested initiation of an extradition procedure, they will consider it. I don't know if India did start extradition but in any case it is a long-drawn process with lots of paperwork and legalese. Was waiting for this. Thank you. :) > $1 billion is the amount that Warren Buffett, the billionaire that has traditionally and even proudly shunned technology, has invested in Apple shares over the last quarter.

I think Buffet has still shunned technology. The investment is for an electric car. Didi is just a test laboratory .

25 times?  How exactly does that work? I love you.  "" Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka ..... will be paid ₹74 crore including stock options this year, which works out to 116 times the median salary of Infosys employees. ""

Small scale semicon fabs plus note to entrepreneurs [POLICY],36,68jwe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/68jwe2/small_scale_semicon_fabs_plus_note_to/,11,"So, Government policy to build semiconductor fabs in India has failed. India has also failed to attract investments in electronics assembly except related to mobile phones and to lesser extent STBs.

If India needs to truly become an IT power then semiconductor fabs are must have.

As government may decide to transition towards electric vehicles, thus our oil imports will fall, but semiconductor imports will rise.

I will not reveal here, but small scale semiconductor manufacturing models can be innovated.

There are some groups in India innovating for RISC-V.

Semiconductors will be increasingly needed everywhere, from solar plants, solar pumps, cars to energy efficient lights.

Yet, India is forced to import semiconductors and precision engineered products like high end molds, tooling, bearings and so on.

Still, most entrepreneurs are focusing on web stack based apps, me-too ecomm, elearn, transactions, travel, accommodation etc. Or J2EE customization (sap, Oracle,jboss) or freelancing​/consulting.

Nothing groundbreaking. India will never produce any Google or Facebook and also never produce any Tesla, SK Hynix, SolarCity etc.

India gets new, groundbreaking products only when PSU units licence produces it for B2b or when a private lala big business house licenses something from abroad.

So called wannable startups and entrepreneurs not relevant to produce anything for real economy.",innovator116," While you seem to be correct, Semiconductor Fabs need billions of dollars of investment. Barrier to entry is too high for startups. Are you aware of any such startups innovating in this space? >India will never produce any Google or Facebook  
  
Neither needed special hardware until into a decade of their existence.   
 Silicon fabrication is the rocket science of electronics. It needs massive investment(unlike e-commerce where you can build a website in a garage), years of hard work to generate many very highly skilled engineer(Ph.D. with decades of experience), quality testing, prototype, packaging, measurement tools.

We need investment in both vertical and horizontal innovation and infrastructure. We need thousands of assembly factories and a few IC fabrication factories.

> but small scale semiconductor manufacturing models can be innovated.

We don't even have small-scale electronics manufacturing plant. All most all electronics goods are either assembled or manufactured by contract where we don't have access to design.

> Still, most entrepreneurs are focusing on web stack based apps, me-too ecomm, elearn, transactions, travel, accommodation etc. Or J2EE customization (sap, Oracle,jboss) or freelancing/consulting.

We overproduce cheap engineers, so some of them start small companies.

> So called wannabe startups and entrepreneurs not relevant to produce anything for real economy.

We need to overproduce chip fabrication engineer to have maturity in electronics and add values to the economy. Auxiliary support infrastructure and industries for a full blown semiconductor foundry cannot spring up overnight, or even over a year. There has to be a concerted effort on multiple fronts simultaneously. It's a difficult one, especially since foundries don't break even for years and years. The barrier to entry is made even taller. If the govt wants to sincerely make India an important player in the electronics market, we need to start with smaller fabs, prototype scale clean rooms for specialized wafers first and not go after 300 mm right away.  Main reason is power I think. ",Policy/Economy,2017-05-01 11:59:50

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

Millions of frustrated math students in schools across India have complained a million times about how nobody is ever going to use pythagorean theorems in real life. And how schools should teach something that people actually use in real life, like how to pay your taxes. Well, the Income Tax Department has taken that complaint to heart. As part of an effort to create a responsible taxpaying society, tax officials are set to [visit](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/i-t-officials-set-to-give-moral-science-lessons-in-schools/articleshow/53164515.cms) schools armed with powerpoints and statistics to teach kids all about taxes including how black money and tax evasion harms the economy. If civics doesn’t put the kids to sleep, now we’ve got backup.

People love freedom. Mostly because it has the word free in it. But Freedom 251 comes at a price. And that price is about ₹50,000 crore. Ringing Bells, the company behind the famous Freedom 251 smartphones that cost ₹251, is [asking](http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report-wait-what-freedom-251-maker-ringing-bells-asks-for-rs-50000-crore-from-government-2232148) the Prime Minister for ₹50,000 crore under the Digital India initiative. Currently, the company faces a loss of up to ₹270 per unit. Given the funds, the company has promised to put a smartphone in the hands of over 750 million Indians.

Mohan Bhagwat's Vijay Dashami Speech [R],59,2i69rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2i69rn/mohan_bhagwats_vijay_dashami_speech_r/,277,"The full speech is available here: http://samvada.org/2014/news/full-text-of-speech-by-rss-sarasanghchalak-mohan-bhagwat-on-vijaya-dashmi-2014-nagpur/

I read through the entire speech and would like to go through it point by point

>Today we see that even when the issue of ecology is being discussed in details for past many decades, **yet we find that with each passing day the ecological destruction is approaching much faster and closer to us.** Because of this environmental destruction, the world is facing newer and deadlier natural calamities consistently. But except for some changes in their vocabulary or some half hearted attempts at symptomatic treatment, no meaningful change is visible in the policies of nations and large multinational companies.

Good, raises the issue of environmental conversation. As we have seen in Uttarakhand, Pune Landslide and several other natural calamities, damaging the environment can be catastrophic. Hopefully, the government is listening. I am worried because it doesn't seem to be listening. Context: http://qz.com/255772/the-11-environmental-disasters-narendra-modi-blessed-in-his-first-100-days/

>In the history of past one thousand years, Bharat has been the only example which has made genuine efforts in this direction through the path of truth and non-violence. ... Neither any questions are raised against one’s faith being different, **nor campaigns are run to destroy other idols of worship**, **nor there is a tradition of raising disputes over the validity or respectability of other’s faith on the basis of systems restricted by the dictates of a book.**

Really? Babri, Kandhamahal happened in Pakistan? Furthermore, his arguments are directed towards Abrahamic religions since they follow a central book. However, the Dharmic religions in India are not immune from religious dogmatism.

>With similar expectations in mind, few months ago, the people of Bharat brought about a drastic change in the government. **This change of government is not even six months old. But positive signs are emanating from time to time** which give hope about emergence of Bharat on the international horizon and it appears that the people’s desire of a life, secure and progressing in all its aspects, will soon start reflecting in the governance. In a very short period, some policy initiatives taken by the central government in national interest on the fronts of economy, national security, international relations and many other areas have raised good hopes.

I was told that this was a non-political event. Why he is praising the BJP government here? 

>The new policy makers should also take best advantage of the vision and experience of **great Bharatiya leaders** right from the tradition of Swamy Vivekananda, Yogi Arvind, Swamy Ramtirth, Gurudev Ravindra Nath Thakur and Lokmanya Tilak to Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Swatantrya Veer Savarkar, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Acharya Vinoba Bhave, Second Sarsanghachalak of RSS Shri ‘Guruji’ aka Madhav Sadashiv Golvalkar,  Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, Jayprakash Narayan and Pt. Deendayal Upadhyay. 

Notice how not even a single Muslim is named. How about people like Abdul Kalam Azad? Again ties in with their ideology. 

>There is a serious **upsurge in the jehadi activities in the southern parts of Bharat**, especially in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. No effective policy imperatives, efforts are visible in curbing such activities. ... Near surrender before these fanatic elements and appeasement policy adopted by the ruling parties in these states, **have put the life of local Hindu communities, the law and order situation as well as the national security under serious threat in the region**. 

Really, the Hindus and their way of life is under threat in Tamil Nadu and Kerala? Or does the RSS chief subtly want to hint at the rising Muslim population in these states and and wants to tie that to rising terrorism in the state. 

>Though an alert, transparent, sensitive and a rule abiding administration is necessary for ending exploitation and ensuring development, equally important is the role of society in eradicating exploitation of the poor through active cooperation, striving in a democratic way to end their exploitation and by running various types of help and support activities in order to take these fruits of development to the deprived people. **We feel it necessary to put a ban on meat exports, beef in particular and cow smuggling in immediate future.**

I was completely with him till the last sentence. How is a ban on meat exports, **beef in particular**, going to help the poor in India? Will it not just eradicate one source of income? 

>Each one of us must test each of our act, whether big or small, on the simple ground that each member of **my great Hindu society**, and each son/daughter of Mother Bharat, is my own brother and sister. We must ensure that **each of our Hindu temple, cremation ground and community water source must remain open to all Hindus**. We should ensure that all Hindus should participate in all functions, celebrations as well as festivals of great heroes and personalities.

So much for the RSS being a national entity, or are non-Hindus anti-national?

>Since its inception, Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh has been engaged in the great mission of building a work force of such swayamsewaks, who are energized with the **pride of their national Hindu identity**; are empowered by inculcating great qualities in their personality; and are prepared to sacrifice everything even their life for the great goal as a constituent of dedicated and disciplined organisation.

Just a little more Hindutva.

The entire speech is very political in nature, it has nothing to do with Vijay Dashami. He is pushing for an India that reflects the RSS' vision, and I find that deeply disturbing. 

 >“BHARAT MATA KI JAI”

That I wholeheartedly agree with, Bharat Mata ki Jai. :)",once_upon_raconteur," Here is an Hindu organization, addressing Hindus on the eve of a Hindu festival, reminding them Hindu traditions, addressing certain supposed Hindu concerns, extolling them to act based on Hindu values and take pride in their Hindu identity. I do not see what is wrong in that.

Now you may argue that what gives them the right to speak for Hindus, but I do not see that being the tone of this speech at least. He is not speaking to nation, or other religious communities in our country, instructing them to do this or that; he just reached out to Hindus in this country. And I think that is totally fine in a democracy. The same way I would not expect Maulvis or Fathers to speak on universal religious concerns.

My only concern (and I know its being discussed on other threads is) why would the national broadcaster telecast this. People might say - oh well they show the Pope, yada yada - but if we really believe secularism is a bastardised word in this country and its true meaning is that state is neutral towards religion, we might as well show the honesty of our belief and act accordingly.  >Really? Babri, Kandhamahal happened in Pakistan? Furthermore, his arguments are directed towards Abrahamic religions since they follow a central book.

If you compare that to idiots like Ghazni, Babur, Timur and so many other Islamic invaders what is Babri Masjid its not even a drop in the ocean. Not justifying it but its BS to equate such a small event to larger context .

2.  Love jihad wasn't even brought up by the RSS way back in the early 2000s  it was a problem in Kerala thats where it started and a lot of non RSS entities were complaining about its not fiction like you would like to believe and its a very real problem . And a lot of it includes subversion kidnapping etc.

3. I rather we not kill cows and sell them off as beef primarily because most of those killed are milk producing cattle. Its retarded to kill it and mass grow cattle for consumption considering its very environmentally heavy industry somethign India doesn't have the resources to afford. There is already a shortage of milk because of these morons.

Also whole idea is short sighted and stupid. Take some time to read UN report on climate change. The cattle industry has caused unprecedented droughts and floods in Australia. 80% of Amazon was chopped down for cattle farming.

Its better to use it milk which is holistic its an unsustainble source of income and it causes far more problems than solves .

4. What the hell why are you getting your panties in a bunch about the Hindu cremation grounds? He never said we should ban others and secondly have some respect to something thats sacred to a community it not your holiday picnic. You come across as a brat. What's striking for me

> There is an urgent need to take up eradication of social discrimination in our society in a bigger and faster way. No government or administrative machinery has the powers to remove feeling of discrimination from people’s mind. It will end only with the efforts and initiative of society itself. This can start only by direct action at the level of our mind, our family and friends. To do this, we will have to remove all such habits, misbelieves, traditions and practices which encourage such discrimination. We will have to drive out even the smallest of the remnants of our caste based, regional and linguistic egos which breed such prejudices. We will have to stop ourselves from even listening to or speaking such provocative statements which encourage such prejudices in our hearts. We must also stop ourselves from participating in any such violent activity that arises from such provocative speech and environment. Each one of us must test each of our act, whether big or small, on the simple ground that each member of my great Hindu society, and each son/daughter of Mother Bharat, is my own brother and sister. We must ensure that each of our Hindu temple, cremation ground and community water source must remain open to all Hindus. We should ensure that all Hindus should participate in all functions, celebrations as well as festivals of great heroes and personalities.

This is by far the most brutal assessment of the ""hindu"" society by ANY leader. He simply says if hindus themselves have to overcome the discrimination meted out to sections in Hindu society.

Also, was in a way hoping to compare (alleged) remote controls of the two (alleged) biggest parties in our democracy.

Think before you act. Dharma ke naam me adharma na karo. If only. > Notice how not even a single Muslim is named. How about people like Abdul Kalam Azad? Again ties in with their ideology.

In Shaakhas if you mention this name when you asked to write list of freedom fighters, you would be politely taught not to do such mistake again  I honestly believe religion is a major factor holding us back, for us to mold ourselves into an egalitarian society we must stop discriminating. Religion should be limited our four walls, we waste to much time talking/debating/fighting/killing over something i believe is  imaginary. Although religion has some ethics, morality and values ingrained in them, a majority of persons practicing their religion completely miss the point, and instead rely on rituals and chanting in hope to get material gains.
In response to DD covering a Mohan bhagwats speech, we live in a democracy and in essence all sections of society should be represented equally whether its the Dalits, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, etc should be give an opportunity to speak and i am sure they have been given air time and i'm sure people have raised objections to them as well. Our society needs to grow and should focus on how we can help each other out instead raising petty issues and dividing people. > Really? Babri, Kandhamahal happened in Pakistan? Furthermore, his arguments are directed towards Abrahamic religions since they follow a central book. However, the Dharmic religions in India are not immune from religious dogmatism.

If you go in History there was no namaaz offered in Babri for years it was just a structure standing . So pointing out Hindus don't point out or ask the validity of one's faith means he's targeting Abrahamic religions wow . Nobody is immune to bad things it's when those very things become your ideology it becomes a matter of concern .

> Notice how not even a single Muslim is named. How about people like Abdul Kalam Azad? Again ties in with their ideology.

He didn't even mention any sikh but you care only about Muslims shows how secular you are ? /s

> Really, the Hindus and their way of life is under threat in Tamil Nadu and Kerala? Or does the RSS chief subtly want to hint at the rising Muslim population in these states and and wants to tie that to rising terrorism in the state.

So you mean Jehadi activity is directly related to increasing muslim population ?

> I was completely with him till the last sentence. How is a ban on meat exports, beef in particular, going to help the poor in India? Will it not just eradicate one source of income?

Beef is an environmental threat and not viable and the exported one doesn't even give protein to our people . Most of the exported beef is processed by machines so very little poor work there . I don't think you have seen a real slaughter house .

> So much for the RSS being a national entity, or are non-Hindus anti-national?

So teaching hindus to abolish bad practices such as casteism  directly becomes sectarian ? 

> The entire speech is very political in nature, it has nothing to do with Vijay Dashami. He is pushing for an India that reflects the RSS' vision, and I find that deeply disturbing.

I find your vision of censorship deeply disturbing .

Here is the government, pushing hard for change. To aspire to move from 140 to 50th rank in the Ease of Doing Business rankings is a huge huge step. To this aid, the govt has,

> The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) has circulated 98 action points to state governments on ""creating an enabling framework for simulating investments 

The thrust is now on states to implement these and also lower ranked states to start performing better. This is a very objective way of ranking everything from the labour climate to corruption and time taken to implement projects and transparency of govt approval systems.

This as the govt is implementing, has the potential to be a game changer, and yet it gets scarce attention - be it on MSM or social media.

DAE Le Acche Din won't happen by magic, it is going to be hard slogging and it is policy decisions and plans like this that will help us get there.

Edit - Some more info,

>Does anyone know the parameters on which the states will be judged? I think thats an important thing to know, when talking about this.

I don't think the DIPP guidelines are available yet, but the metrics used in this ranking can be seen [here](http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/india)

There are broadly 10 main parameters, each of these 10 parameters have between 15 to 30 sub parameters, so we are looking at around 200 odd indicators.

[India drops to dismal 142nd in 'ease of doing business' rankings](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/India-drops-to-dismal-142nd-in-ease-of-doing-business-rankings/articleshow/44969091.cms),

>> In the ten metrics used to measure ease of doing business in the Bank's 2015 report, which covers the period from June 2013 to May 2014 (when the UPA was in power), India came close to the bottom in two categories. It stood a wretched 184th (out of 189 countries) in the category ""Dealing with Construction Permits,"" and 186th (out of 189 countries)in ""Enforcing Contracts.""

This is why this is so important, changes made to say getting construction permits will also affect how us citizens get these. Likewise registering property or getting electricity connections. These won't be isolated reforms, but sweeping reforms.

Saying, ""we will eliminate corruption"" makes for good sound bytes, but it is not systemic change. THIS is systemic change.

Could not agree more! Thanks for posting this. Perhaps in threads like these we can get people from different sides of aisle coming up together.

I think that it is great to have a rating like this to come by. Even if imperfect, it will force the states to compete. The fig leaf of slow central government will not hold water if other states are doing well. 

I hope MSM can start to popularize such 10-15 metrics to force the governments and show them the mirror. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSizHbVVcHI

Good insight in this interview (on ease of doing business). Though not sure what Kant can do since DIPP doesn't enjoy that much influence. 

Also, this story was widely posted on reddit as well as visible in print media. You really don't expect Times Now to carry this, do you? That's ET Now's domain. We are much more worried about our political ideologies than betterment of this country  I'd rather this government keeps doing all this reform-shiform sh1z among all the randi rona around ghar wapsi etc. Let the choots do what they do best - chutiyapa. I hope states pursue this seriously. It's a mess

There is so much potential to reduce paperwork in this country even as a citizen. For example tax savings. Why do I need to submit the proof for every investment I make. Everyone has my PAN number, everything is linked. just automatically do it. Allow me to make changes if something is missed, but default option should be autofill for these type of stuff. 

MY second biggest peeve is everyone asking for Address proof for everything. I have changed house 4 times in last 2 years in two different cities. My Driving License, Passport and Aadhar card all have different address, all of which are different from my current address. :| 

Aadhar already has my biometric data and my identity, why do I have to give a address proof for everything?!

P.S. Sorry OP I went on a tangential rant mode, but it get frustrating when all your documents are a mess and the road to rectify them is long and covered with red tape >.< Sure. I would like to see more self-posts/discussions on threads like this. I have no clue why it does not happen to the extent it can or should.

...

But tell me, in the overall perspective, won't competitive federalism *necessarily* kill cooperative federalism? Viewing it from a State's self-interest. Wouldn't it at least relegate it to outside of focus, as things start moving along this path? Under such circumstances, what would cooperative federalism actually mean?

...

Some of the targets in the list seemed a bit ambitious - such as the land records database with recommended information and consolidation/rationalisation of all state-specific labor laws. The others seemed possible. 

On 30^th June 2015, won't the States which are presently in a position to achieve these targets, gain a head start - in terms of being ranked high on the ease of doing business? I'm not saying it is unfair, since that seems to be whole idea to convey to an entrepreneur where he should set up his business. Just that I'm a little unsure of how Modi would like to manage that flow of investments into States or *if* he intends to do that at all. Posts on shallow topics, name calling, sh1t posting are way too easy than such discussions. 

On Topic : Actually, I have suggested a similar policy a long time ago. I would like to see each state fund its own self over time. The funds from centre will dry up gradually over time - say 40 years or so - and the states take care of themselves. The states become business entities where they trade amongst themselves for various resources. The centre will produce money to invest in research, border security etc. that requires its intervention. Basically, India becomes like the EU just that India is still a country.

 Interesting how mainstream media going hammer and tongs over Hindutva fringe doesn't even do a token analysis of reforms like this.

BJP has fringe elements, who doesn't ? Since there are no corruptions or scams to speak of, media is exaggerating fringe elements and what not. I really don't understand the unfair significance meted out to the so called ""secularism"" in our public discourse Read in ET today on how because of Delhi results, the upcoming budget might not be the *bitter medicine* that Modi talked of. That made me kind of pessimistic. If a govt. with a clear majority at centre will resort to being populist just because of an election loss then it will take an epoch to improve upon the conditions the OP has discussed about. I hope they think wisely. Brilliant post OP. I personally think that this is one the best and most powerful decision bjp govt has taken or could have taken!
Decisions like these would make sure that India has a bright future for next 30 years!! This is such a great reform. But guess we are busy with the after party of Aam AAdmi Party You are right, we should be talking about stuff like this more. 

It is indeed a good step! It would be interesting to see (in a few years) which states climb up the ranking and which ones fall. 

Does anyone know the parameters on which the states will be judged?  I think thats an important thing to know, when talking about this.  Thing is , a majority of posters here are:

1) Dumb fanbois.

2) Don't know a thing about economics, defence, judiciary and other stuff which affects their lives in an indirect manner.

3) Are more interested in following the herd in supporting issues which will get them upvotes on reddit like gay rights, shitting on religions etc. for two examples.


4) Are more often than not, trolls who just want to indulge in flame wars where they can prove themselves to be holier than thou.

5) A vast majority thinks that using swear words like ""fucking"" makes them seem grow up.


You can't expect a reasonable discussion with a crowd like this. Even when you start doing it, there are atleast 4 posters here who will start posting inane stuff just to avoid giving any credit to central govt. Then someone counters their shit post and whole threads turns to absolute rubbish with attention o posters diverted towards the pig wrestling in mud rather than the issue at hand.


Freedom of expression is one thing, but some people are here just to project the insecurities of their personal lives here. But.....but what about my relegion? When will i become the majority? I was shocked and saddened when i learned that many of my colleagues who belong to the so called minority relegions hate modi because of this. When we chat casually relegion somehow, becomes the topic of discussion. I try to steer them back to actual topics like development of our nation and shit like at that point they loose intrest and we go on about our daily work. This is depressing and sad They should use HDI instead of such random criteria.And also it does not takes into account the amount of environmental damage such race can induce.Being industry freindly does not means that we can ruin environment.Also giving freebies to industries at cost of people is not right Land acquisition act is an example.removed for being anti-business.They should enforce this for HDI compliance.  How about ranking states by the quality of life?

Ease of doing business does not necessarily translate into a better quality of life. Ease of doing business, by itself, means nothing. Will they give points for free electricity? did some1 get a gold on this subreddit . woah . unreal . Modi is an impressive character. I disagree that this will not bring him votes. Once the effects start showing, he is going to be winning perhaps even bigger victories than the one he had last year.

He just needs to fire the incompetents in his Cabinet and draw a red line between his government and his religious reactionary rivals who are doing their level best to drag him down. Ranking doesn't change shit. If it did India's 'dismal' ranking would've had an impact decades ago. I also hate these stupid posts as if Modi government (whatever that term means) was the only one to attempt these

I do wish there was [a] an easy to track, up to date website of top 10 government initiatives [b] a forum to learn/discuss/debate these

I am wholeheartedly in support of increasing ties to Israel, even going as far as signing defense treaties with them to secure their independence(Aerial, Naval and spec ops assets only), maybe not now but a decade later latest by 2030.

From my perspective taking into account the backstabbing done by Arab states during the '71 war is something to be remembered. Why support the Palestinian state when they the entire Arab world except the Saddam Hussein regime backed Pakistani claim on Kashmir and sent military aid during the war.

Gone are the days when we supported the Arabs either out of fear for our Muslim population's vote or Nehru's idealism. Israel has helped us quite a lot.

Let's see the sole protector of Israeli state right now is United States, any attempt to run over Israel during the cold war with Soviet arms by the Arabs would have ( and did in fact during the yom kippur war) invited Americans to bolster Israel even more so the Soviets stayed clear of too much trouble.

By 2048 the United States will be neck to neck with India economically and China would have surged far ahead of us. As such I don't see United states continuing their aid to Israel, whereas we would be in such a growth position to spend a few billions on helping Israelis, the question is should we put the building blocks in place now?


**EDIT** I suppose most of the fucktards calling me names about our economy, I say check IMF and World Bank reports. Just because you have a hatred for the current government or were not good enough to have a nice career does not mean our economy is bad. 
I have seen my mother's salary increase from her starting of 26k in 1991(inflation adjusted) to about 4,00,000 today.  I asked for a dispassionate discussion but what I am for the most part getting is shits. Fuck off if you have nothing to contribute to this policy discussion.


During the Kargil war, it was Israel who supplied Laser guided bomb kits, on one phone call, the IDF sent a Brigadier rank officer with a plane full of kits and technicians, without any sorts of payments. ",ilovemilfcreampie," Hi,

I'm glad you asked this question. There's a lot of ""emotional pheeling"" in this topic, and I want to offer a cold rational view of the situation:

It boils down to this: whenever possible, one should run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. 

Some observations:

1. You've forgotten that our stand on Palestine is one factor that gives us good relations with Iran, which is critical for our strategic interests.

2. The support by various Arab nations for Pakistan during the wars was basically a joke, and more like a token assistance which had no impact on the war. It's easily forgiven.

3. Israel hasn't really ""helped us a lot"". They've sold us great weapons at market prices, which is a very normal thing to do. Our reliance on the Arab states and Iran for oil is of far more importance.

4. Israel understands that supporting Palestine in today's world has little practical value. It's just a lip service, really. 

So I think our policy of ambivalence is perfect, and should be continued.  > By 2048 the United States will be neck to neck with India economically

When you randomly pull a number out of your ass, make it a multiple of 10 so people can cut your approximation some slack. We don't support Arab states because of pseudo-secularism. We support them because you have to take sides in the conflict. And do you side with one country with defense technology or an entire block of countries with oil and other resources?

If India had some level of energy independence or economic clout - we could think about who's right or wrong. Right now we just have to try and get the most out of both sides. And forsake Iran, our route into Central Asia with added benefits of surrounding Pakistan? I feel glad that our policy makers are not as naive as you. we have a huge number of indian citizens living and working in middle eastern muslim countries. their lives and livelihood will be at risk if we openly antagonize them. even though these countries support pakistan openly, india also benefits tremendously from the soft power and cordial relations it has with these countries. the deportation of abu jundal is one such example.

india is good at simultaneously maintaining good relations with countries which are at each other's throats. like iran and the US. india should continue doing whatever its doing. >By 2048 the United States will be neck to neck with India economically and China would have surged far ahead of us.

he he India is in bed with Israel and the whole world knows it.

 If making overtures to Israel damages our relationship with Iran, which it seems like it most certainly will, then we should not pursue it. 

Israel is not nearly as important a potential ally for India as Iran currently is. If we need oil, which we definitely need, last I checked, then we can't risk our relationship with Iran. Simple as that. 

Also:

""By 2048 the United States will be neck to neck with India economically""

It'd be nice to see a source for this, cause I don't see how it can happen. 

America is not going to go quietly into the night, they'll create whatever kind of international quagmires they need to, to bolster their defense spending and keep their economy red-hot. It's literally what's been keeping the economy going since 1945, conflict. In the US war is business and business is a-boomin'. [deleted] I understand your points but don't support them. US fails miserably in Middle East because they pick sides, sometimes the wrong sides. Right now Russia is using it's military and economic diplomacy to work with Saudi Arabia, Iran and Israel. We have supported Israel and Palestine. Israels knows our relationship with other Arabic nations and they don't have an issue. The reality is that only a 2-state solution will work long-term for Israel. If they were to go for a one state solution, Muslims will outnumber Jews in a single Israel state. 

We should maintain and increase our technology and defence exchange with Israel but that does not need to be at cost of our relations with other Arab nations. We also need Iran in case of rebuilding Afghanistan and a bulwark to Pakistan. A joint Iran-Afghan-India mission to promote disintegration of Pakistan especially of Baluchistan, Gilgit-Baltistan has been something I hope our intelligence agency and govt. looks into.  And no one talks about what is the right position. Or what is the right thing to do.

Coming from colonialism ourselves, Ann apartheid state of sorts ourselves, lovely to see we have now truly become independent. Not caring about what is right.. But caring only of profit and gain. imagine if this debate were being had during the Raj. At that time, it would be the US or Canada talking about how they should support the British in their colonisation of India. 

Israel is a colonial apartheid state. There isn't much in India I'm proud of, but our principled support for Occupied Palestine was one of them. Sadly, this too is fading. ",Policy/Economy,2016-05-18 01:52:48

Rajan didn’t step down. He was pushed out in one of the most unfortunate decisions of the Modi administration. There are a lot of similarities with how Abdul Kalam was denied a second term as the President by Sonia Gandhi. In both cases, you had an amazing individual who had the energy, reputation and the will to stand up to the government. The political heads hate such a challenge.

Unlike the past RBI governors who were given 5 year terms, Rajan was only given a 3 year term by the previous government and the present government used that chance to deny him a second term [for the same reason that the previous government gave him such a short term]. I will give you some background.

There were sparks publicly flying between RBI and the government for a while and this end result was probably not a total surprise. RBI and the government are two opposite forces [sort of like developers and testers in a software team] who work to build the economy.

The government has the control of the “fiscal policy” - dealing with matters like spending and taxing. The reserve bank has the control of the “monetary policy” - dealing with matters like interest rates and bank loans. Governments would typically love to spend/invest a lot to grow the economy, while the RBI would love to have the government spend less & maintain a low inflation [more government spending equals more inflation].

In short, the government is the accelerator and the Reserve Bank is the brake.

If you don’t press the accelerator, you won’t get anywhere. If you don’t press the brake, you will get somewhere [not necessarily alive]. There is a healthy conflict between the two.

While there were tensions even in the past, they were quite less. The RBI governors are usually mellowed men [in a land of many women bankers, they never get picked to head the RBI] who are honest and smart, but will quickly back down from a conflict. They are typically old too - sort of like the Presidents - chosen carefully to not have too much energy.

Rajan is among the youngest RBI governors and is a live wire. He has an international reputation no other RBI governor ever had. Within his 40s, he has seen some of the world’s best economics related posts - including being the youngest Chief Economist of the IMF (International Monetary Fund) . He doesn’t require a job. India required him.

Rajan was an energetic drill sergeant who makes you sweat and no body likes to sweat. He was brought in as a desperate move in the last days of the Manmohan Singh government which lost all its credibility and needed something to restore India’s credibility in the financial markets.

As India’s economic prospects improved with Modi’s arrival [and with a healthy dose of Rajan’s policies] the desperation of politicians went away. The tough medicine started to taste bitter as the emergency passed. They believe Rajan is applying the brakes even after the calamity has passed and you have a free road ahead of you. Rajan believes that he needs to keep off the sugar so that the government can snack on a healthy diet.

Unlike the previous RBI governors, Rajan also made a few political statements that unlike how the media reported, were not that controversial. However, like the President, the RBI governor is expected to stay away from politics and not make any statements unrelated to their job.

These two things cost his job. a) He was an inflation hawk whom the government and business community accuse as pressing the brakes too much. b) He had too much energy and independent thinking.

The question is not just one of Rajan or inflation or interest rates. It is about a system where the heads of key institutions are not expected to stay independent. This political meddling has been there since the start [from the times of Nehru]. We always elect old, unambitious, insipid, uncontroversial leaders for our top posts because the top politicians are scared of ambition, energy and independence. In the rare times these get selected, the politicians push them out sooner or later.

Even if the government doesn’t like their ideas or policies, it has to work with them - because our system is only as strong as its institutions. The government has to change its mind and bring back Rajan.",mathurawai," Who is balaji?  Initial Response: Who on the earth is Balaji Vishwanathan? Was gonna make the same post. When an ardent supporter of BJP makes a post like this on a pro BJP site like Quora ,  you know something's up. Please let this gutter of a person be in Quora.

Wait so government appoints governor? And the post is independent? Something doesn't compute.

If it's a government appointment, shouldn't it be the government's prerogative to not renew a governor who they think is incompatible with them? Why do we give a shit about what a charlatan like this guy thinks?

TRAI Issues a Consultation Paper on Cloud Computing: More serious issue than NN? What do you think?,67,4nkpo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4nkpo0/trai_issues_a_consultation_paper_on_cloud/,33,"So, the consultation paper is [here.](http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReadData/WhatsNew/Documents/Cloud_Computing_Consultation_paper_10_june_2016.pdf) | **Issued 10 June 2016**

Comments have been solicited till upto July 8, 2016.

I won't discuss the technicalities of what it seeks to achieve and how. *The Hindu Business Line*, rightly or wrongly, has a scare-mongering headline for its piece this morning:

[Govt wants to legally snoop into your emails](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/govt-wants-to-legally-snoop-into-your-emails/article8714983.ece)

Since, we do know that the previous dispensation sought to gain control over how Indian users access and use the internet and it is common knowledge that it is very much in the present government's interests to continue to do so (under the garb of 'Lawful Access', of course) by generating a seeming 'consensus' on the subject through 'open' consultations, I figured I could highlight some of the problematic ways in which this issue has been framed.

Before i do that, these are the questions that the paper requests responses to:

* **Question 1**. What are the paradigms of cost benefit analysis especially in terms of:
* a. accelerating the design and roll out of services
* b. Promotion of social networking, participative governance and e-commerce.
* c. Expansion of new services.
* d. Any other items or technologies. Please support your views with relevant data.
* **Question 2**. Please indicate with details how the economies of scale in the cloud will help cost reduction in the IT budget of an organisation?
* **Question 3**. What parameters do the business enterprises focus on while selecting type of cloud service deployment model? How does a decision on such parameters differ for large business setups and SMEs?
* **Question 4**. How can a secure migration path may be prescribed so that migration and deployment from one cloud to another is facilitated without any glitches?
* **Question 5**. What regulatory provisions may be mandated so that a customer is able to have control over his data while moving it in and out of the cloud?
* **Question 6**. What regulatory framework and standards should be put in place for ensuring interoperability of cloud services at various levels of implementation viz. abstraction, programming and orchestration layer?
* **Question 7**. What shall be the QoS parameters based on which the performance of different cloud service providers could be measured for different service models? The parameters essential and desirable and their respective benchmarks may be suggested.
* **Question 8**. What provisions are required in order to facilitate billing and metering re-verification by the client of Cloud services? In case of any dispute, how is it proposed to be addressed/ resolved?
* **Question 9**. What mechanism should be in place for handling customer complaints and grievances in Cloud services? Please comment with justification.
* **Question 10**. Enumerate in detail with justification, the provisions that need to be put in place to ensure that the cloud services being offered are secure.
* **Question 11**. What are the termination or exit provisions that need to be defined for ensuring security of data or information over cloud?
* **Question 12**. What security provisions are needed for live migration to cloud and for migration from one cloud service provider to another?
* **Question 13**. What should be the roles and responsibilities in terms of security of (a) Cloud Service Provider(CSP); and (b) End users?
* **Question 14**. The law of the user’s country may restrict cross-border transfer/disclosure of certain information. How can the client be protected in case the Cloud service provider moves data from one jurisdiction to another and a violation takes place? What disclosure guidelines need to be prescribed to avoid such incidents?
* **Question 15**. What polices, systems and processes are required to be defined for information governance framework in Cloud, from lawful interception point of view and particularly if it is hosted in a different country?
* **Question 16**. What shall be the scope of cloud computing services in law? What is your view on providing license or registration to Cloud service providers so as to subject them to the obligations thereunder? Please comment with justification.
* **Question 17**. What should be the protocol for cloud service providers to submit to the territorial jurisdiction of India for the purpose of lawful access of information? What should be the effective guidelines for and actions against those CSPs that are identified to be in possession of information related to the commission of a breach of National security of India?
* **Question 18**. What are the steps that can be taken by the government for:
* (a) promoting cloud computing in e-governance projects.
* (b) promoting establishment of data centres in India.
* (c) encouraging business and private organizations utilize cloud
services
* (d) to boost Digital India and Smart Cities incentive using cloud.
* **Question 19**. Should there be a dedicated cloud for government applications? To what extent should it support a multi-tenant environment and what should be the rules regulating such an environment?
* **Question 20**. What infrastructure challenges does India face towards development and deployment of state data centres in India? What should be the protocol for information sharing between states and between state and central?
* **Question 21**. What tax subsidies should be proposed to incentivise the promotion of Cloud Services in India? Give your comments with justification. What are the other incentives that can be given to private sector for the creation of data centres and cloud services platforms in India?

While I feel that issues of interoperability and quality of service as well as standards are red herrings of a sort (there isn't much of data to support the contention that these *are* or *will become* serious issues impeding cloud adoption in India), the following sections appear to indicate areas of concern (if not outright conflict):

>*The Government of India proposes to bring out legislation namely* ***“The Right to Privacy Bill”*** *which aims to provide for the ‘right to privacy’ to the citizens of India. It is said that intellectual property issues in the cloud continue to be one of the ""cloudiest"" legal areas for customers and suppliers alike because IPR and data protection laws vary from country to country. This makes the application of laws difficult since the question of jurisdiction creates confusion in the cloud computing environment since there are plenty of different ways in which copyright-infringing content can be uploaded onto the cloud, given the vast number of services, which are provided, in the cloud. To deal with this problem, it needs to be ensured that every party involved is well aware of the regulations and the rights of the country in which the data/work is so stored and how potential infringements can be efficiently avoided.*

>*Lawful Interception: This is an extremely important aspect of any communication or information transfer as* ***Lawful Interception by a Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) is an established and transparent method*** *for letting Governments protects their boundaries, integrity and sovereignty in addition to national security. The Government will have to ensure a strict and vigilant interception system in cloud computing environment so as to meet the above requirements. With more and more happenings in the cloud – the previous methods of Lawful intercept are no longer valid and as such need new thinking as:*

>* *Machines and data are no longer physically in one place or national boundary*
>* *Encryption and security of data are far stronger and of industrial grade*
>* *End companies have to sign deeper and more stringent End User Agreements with customers that previously never covered data (data was local and software manipulated it locally).*

>*Multi-Jurisdiction Issue Legal Framework: To overcome the problem of multiple jurisdictions one of the possibilities may be* ***to mandate the cloud service providers to host the data centres only in India***. *Another alternative may be* ***to impose restriction on cross border movement of some critical information like tax returns, financial transactions, health records*** *etc.*

>*Adequate Penal Measures- Where the law stipulates certain precautions to be taken by the ISP, vendor and intermediary with respect to data storage, transfer and processing, it fails to enumerate any stringent penal action against those who violate these precautions. The punitive measures and especially the fines, defined are too meagre to ensure proper protection of data. Personal and sensitive data has to be maintained with utmost confidentiality; and the trust of the information provider must be safeguarded. Where highly sensitive data is being handled,* ***the law may also suggest an imprisonment term (depending on the gravity of the crime) in addition to the fine prescribed. For repeated contravention, the licenses of service providers may be suspended or cancelled.***

>***The Government could introduce some form of licensing or operational restrictions on intermediate service providers***. *Complying with new rules under the amended Information Technology Act, 2000 requires providers of sensitive information to verify the information which can become onerous given that data may be held in fragmented corners of the cloud. For this, the Laws need to be reviewed and new policies should be introduced to effectively and efficiently deal with matters involving confusion with respect to the basic and highly important issue of jurisdiction.*

So, it's up to us now. What do we think?

Edit: Missed this bit -

>6.10. Citing the need to monitor domestic Internet traffic for national security reasons, concerns over foreign surveillance, and a desire to ensure that data is subject to local laws, the Indian government has for years supported the idea of foreign firms storing data within the country. One clear example of the push for data localization is found in the Department of Telecommunications’ “National Telecom M2M Roadmap” (referring to machine-to-machine data transmission of the sort expected to increase substantially as Internet connected devices become more common), in January 2015. T**he guidelines call for “all M2M gateways and application servers” used in providing services to individuals in India to be physically located within the country, based on national security concerns**. *Although cloud vendors would not be the explicit focus of this provision, its inclusion points to the acceptance of data localization policies among some in the Indian government*.",Aajaanabahu," As I read it, this is what the GoI wants:

* Standards become necessary - for establishment of LILEA (it could not keep pace with differences in implementations easily, otherwise).

* LILEA is necessary for 'letting Governments protects their boundaries, integrity and sovereignty in addition to national security'.

* The only way to achieve that is to have CSPs host DCs in India. The issue of territorial jurisdiction is discussed at length in the paper.

* If the above be what is required, then it subjects the CSPs to - *A key component of Information Technology Rules, 2011 is that any organization processing personal information in India requires written consent before undertaking certain activities and must implement reasonable security policies and procedures. These rules apply to organizations operating in India and are independent of whether the data originates in India or if it pertains to Indian citizens. (Page 55 of the paper ibid)*.

* The alternative suggested restricts you from sharing your tax returns, financial data and health records internationally or your CSP from doing so, if it holds such data, for operational efficiencies (such as consolidation/optimization of their infrastructure and systems).

* Violations by tenants of the cloud systems could, potentially, render the CSPs liable to imprisonment, apart from fines and/or cancellation of licences.

* The *licence raj* is back.

Edit: 

I'm not sure how this squares up against *our* idea of privacy - and guarantees thereof. It's also a little surprising that the GoI is not inviting wide-ranging consultations for the Privacy Bill, which if it precedes this, will have this conform *post facto*. 

It's a master-stroke of sorts, since pretty much everything is moving onto the cloud now. A visit to Angel List reveals that most startups in India have a mobile app/web application which runs off a cloud backend - and what most of us private citizens do on the web (which is mobile-first in India) is app-driven. 

Edit^2:

The Annexures provide some info on Cloud Architectures and how privacy concerns have been addressed (in a rather summary fashion) by some countries. It highlights the 2004 APEC model, wherein CSPs are held accountable - as distinct from the others. 

The key takeaway is, however, that it provides no information/reference whatsoever in relation to questions 14-17 listed above.  Section-wise TL; DR

 I have just started reading the paper's first few pages and so far there is no answer to regulating cloud services. Why there *has* to be interoperability mandated? I am not even sure if TRAI has authority to demand all these things except for Government using them https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApQlMm39xr0 O.K, O.P, I read your wall of text, and felt like reading a mystery novel from the middle. I have no clue what this consultation paper is about or what is going on and can't relate to your post's title.

Perhaps you can give a quick summary/tl;dr on it?

I mean I did see the recent sticky asking for us to send mails and I did do that, but as for your post I am drawing to a complete blank. now they care about privacy!, that's weird, first successfully pass right to privacy, then these discussion can be meaningful, since we are going to be dealt with lot a assumptions when it comes to cloud(since there is no universal definition of it) >Govt wants to legally snoop into your emails

They are already snooping in our mails and online activity using [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Monitoring_System) Several people have commented on the snooping issue. If we look at this carefully, there are 4 possible outcomes. 

1. American government can snoop, and the Indian government can snoop.
2. American govt. can snoop, but the Indian govt. cannot 
3. American govt. cannot snoop, but the Indian govt. can
4. Neither the American nor Indian govt. can snoop. 

From what I have read, the objective is to prevent 1 and 2 from occurring, and allow 3 to happen. This isn't that necessary bad.  The current problem with Google, Facebook, etc. is that it allows our data to be snooped by the Americans, simply because these are all American companies, and the top people are more likely to comply with their own government (American) requests, than Indian ones.  Indian citizens have as much chance to influence America government policy as they have to influence Pakistan government policy. So rejecting options 1 and 2 is in practice, a good idea.

Looking at options 3 and 4. A reasonable question is why don't we want option 4 instead? The problem with option 4 is that it also means that our enemies will be able to use the same cloud resources without being detected. This is obviously something we want to avoid. 

My personal opinion is that any cloud computing policy is to first ensure *no* foreign governments, however friendly, have ever any access to our data. Even if our own government is however corrupt or will abuse this privilege. Once that is done, we can then work towards preventing our own government from abusing this privilege.

**Killing Tax Havens - One Treaty At A Time**

Question - What country ranks second in the share of foreign portfolio investments made in the Indian stock market? Answer - First of all, that is a very specific question to ask. And second of all, if you [answered](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-12/news/73039798_1_tax-treaty-capital-gains-tax-mauritius) Mauritius, give yourself a pat on the back. It’s not that ~~Martian~~ Mauritian citizens are crazy about Indian stocks, Mauritius is just an island that is even smaller than Mumbai and Delhi put together. It’s that investments made through Mauritius were exempt from Indian capital gains taxes - which essentially transformed Mauritius into a tax haven. It was all legal under a 30-year old treaty between the two countries that was signed in 1983. Ahh, the 1980s - when the Panama Papers wasn’t a thing, the accountants didn’t have to worry about ethics, and writing physical letters was actually cool and not just hipster cool. But all that and more is changing. Under an amendment to the treaty that was [agreed](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/u4AzTTKA5vCRJBWhANkuZN/Some-FAQs-on-the-Mauritius-tax-treaty.html) upon last week, India will begin imposing a capital gains tax on all future investments made through the country. This gives existing investors some wiggle room, and doesn’t trigger a crash in case existing investors decide to pull out.


**Raghu’s Second Term**

Time flies when you’re having fun, and it’s already time for another governor at the RBI. Current governor Raghuram Rajan’s term is about to end in September and there’s some awkward tension in the air about his reappointment since Rajan’s crusade against bad loans is expected to be done by March 2017, a full 6 months after his term expires. Chosen under former PM Manmohan Singh’s administration, Rajan [says](http://www.businessinsider.in/RBIs-Raghuram-Rajan-keeps-mum-about-second-term-but-reveals-his-backup-plan/articleshow/52185985.cms) he hasn’t been asked if he wants to continue as governor and intends to go back to teaching when he’s done. He can act as coy as he wants, but everyone knows that he wants to continue as governor. Who wouldn’t? It’s like asking an olympic gold winner if he’d like to continue winning the gold. However, the newest member of the Rajya Sabha, Subramanian Swamy, has [stated](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/send-raghuram-rajan-back-to-chicago-subramanian-swamys-new-attack-1405498) that Rajan is unsuitable to run the RBI and shouldn’t be reappointed. Swamy says that Rajan should instead pack up his bags and go to the US, where he is a professor at the University of Chicago. ‘Go back to (insert country here)’ seems to be a recurring theme lately.

**EPF Changes: Strike Three?**

At first they tried to tax your EPF withdrawals. But that didn’t work out. Then, they tried to restrict EPF withdrawals until you’re 58. But that didn’t work out either. Now, they are back. And this time, they want to help you buy a house. A new scheme currently under discussion would [allow](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/epfo-members-to-benefit-as-govt-plans-low-cost-housing-scheme-for-over-5-cr-subscribers/251510/) you to pledge future EPF contributions as installments towards buying a house. Here’s how it would work: You go out and try to find your ultimate dream house. You give up and settle on one that your wife likes, because you just want to get this over with. Then you find a bank that doesn’t think you’re Mallya 2.0 and gives you a home loan. And now, your future EPF contributions can count as installments on the home loan. But you also have to be a low-income first-time home buyer to qualify. The last two times any modifications to the EPF system have been proposed, they have backfired.

The kryptonite of any agrarian economy is a prolonged drought. Like the one we’ve been having in over 10 states for the past two years now. A recent study [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/rs-650000-crore-thats-the-impact-the-drought-will-have-on-the-indian-economy-says-assocham/) the total impact of that drought on the national economy at ₹6,50,000 crore. That number is so huge, your brain is incapable of processing it. That’s because a loss of ₹100 is a tragedy, a loss of ₹100 crore is a statistic. Moving on to some much lighter news - the Indian banking [system](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/its-that-bad-if-you-pay-rs-150-for-a-bank-stock-rs-50-is-going-as-bad-loan/articleshow/52291846.cms) is on fire. If you spend ₹150 on buying stock in the average Indian bank right now - you’d be spending ₹50 just to purchase the bad loans that come with the bank. The skeletons could’ve stopped tumbling out at any point - but what’s the fun in that? New estimates show that the amount of bad loans in the Indian banking system might be greater than the entire economy of New Zealand. Little reminder - In statistics, you can either pick the data and write the story it supports, or you can pick the story and write the data that supports it.

 Brilliant stuff, as always.

Two things:

1) Why, according to you, is the government so eager to dip into the EPF money? From what you have written about the low-income housing scheme, do you think it's a constant effort to redirect the money towards recapitalizing failing banks?

2) PNB Q4 results will be out today. Do you have an inkling when the other banks will start declaring theirs? Sensex is already jittery, fell 250 points since morning.

Wired story on 'How Trump Conquered Facebook - Without Russian Ads' | What it means in diverse Indian society,7,81cer1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/81cer1/wired_story_on_how_trump_conquered_facebook/,1,"Here's a thought-provoking article in Wired, titled [How Trump Conquered Facebook—Without Russian Ads](https://www.wired.com/story/how-trump-conquered-facebookwithout-russian-ads/), on how Facebook's **auction system optimized for content engagement which heavily favored troll-y, outrageous, clickbait-y ads**. 

Think about what it does for politics, in diverse Indian context, when algorithm doesn't care about civic engagement as much as it care about its expected-profits.

Some Excerpts:
> Last Friday, Rob Goldman, a vice president inside Facebook’s Ads team, rather ill-advisedly published a series of tweets... the tweets said that the **online advertising campaign led by the shadowy Internet Research Agency was meant to divide the American people**, not influence the 2016 election.

> You’re probably skeptical of Rob’s claim, and I don’t blame you. The world looks very different to people outside the belly of Facebook’s monetization beast. But when you’re on the inside, like Rob is and like I was, and you have access to the revenue dashboards detailing every ring of the cash register, your worldview tends to follow what advertising data can and cannot tell you.

> ... Russia’s Facebook ads were almost certainly less consequential than the Trump campaign’s mastery of **two critical parts of the Facebook advertising infrastructure: The ads auction, and a benign-sounding but actually Orwellian product called Custom Audiences (and its diabolical little brother, Lookalike Audiences). Both of which sound incredibly dull, until you realize that the fate of our 242-year-old experiment in democracy once depended on them, and surely will again**.

> ... During the run-up to the election, the Trump and Clinton campaigns bid ruthlessly for the same online real estate in front of the same swing-state voters. **But because Trump used provocative content to stoke social media buzz, and he was better able to drive likes, comments, and shares than Clinton, his bids received a boost from Facebook’s click model**, effectively winning him more media for less money.

> ... The above auction analysis is even more true for News Feed, which is only based on engagement, with every user mired in a self-reinforcing loop of engagement, followed by optimized content, followed by more revealing engagement, then more content, ad infinitum. **The candidate who can trigger that feedback loop ultimately wins. The Like button is our new ballot box, and democracy has been transformed into an algorithmic popularity contest**.

> **But how to trigger the loop? For that, we need the machinery of targeting... Despite folklore about “selling your data,” most Facebook advertisers couldn’t care less about your Likes, your drunk college photos, or your gossipy chats with a boyfriend**... Custom Audiences lets them do that. It’s the tunnel beneath the data wall that allows the outside world into Facebook’s well-protected garden, and it’s like that by design.

> ... **Facebook can also populate an audience by reading a user’s cookies—those digital fragments gathered through a user’s wanderings around the web. Half the bizarre conspiracy theories around Facebook targeting boil down to you leaving a data trail somewhere inside our consumer economy** that was then uploaded via Custom Audiences. In the language of database people, there’s now a “join” between the Facebook user ID (that’s you) and this outside third-party who knows what you bought, browsed, or who you voted for (probably). That join is permanent, irrevocable, and will follow you to every screen where you’ve used Facebook.

> ... **With a mere mouse click from our hypothetical campaign manager, Facebook now searches the friends of everyone in the Custom Audience, trying to find everyone who (wait for it) “looks like” you**. Using a witches’ brew of mutual engagement—probably including some mix of shared page Likes, interacting with similar News Feed or Ads content, a score used to measure your social proximity to friends—the Custom Audience is expanded to a bigger set of like-minded people. Lookalikes.

> ... **We’ve all contributed to this political balkanization by self-sorting (or being sorted by Facebook) into online tribes that get morphed into filter bubbles, which are then studiously colonized by commercial memes planted and spread there by a combination of Custom and Lookalike Audiences**.

> ... None of this is even novel: **It’s merely best practice for any smart Facebook advertiser. Custom Audiences was launched almost six (!) years ago, marketed publicly at the time, and only now is becoming a mainstream talking point**. The ads auction has been studied by marketers and academics for even longer. The only surprise is how surprising it can still seem to many.

> If we’re going to reorient our society around Internet echo chambers, with Facebook and Twitter serving as our new Athenian agora, then we as citizens should understand how that forum gets paid for. Rarely will the owners of that now-privatized space deign to explain how they’re keeping the lights on. 

Now, back to India, the **most diverse democracy** in the world:

How do you think this will play out in Indian context, where populace are even more susceptible to hate-stories and fake-news meant to trigger religious/caste polarization; which often results in **people engaging far less on policy issues like health-care, education, job opportunities, agriculture, inequality** etc.

The TRAI has a new consultation paper on net neutrality--its fourth one so far. Here's my response. [np],71,4lucjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4lucjl/the_trai_has_a_new_consultation_paper_on_net/,33,"The TRAI has another consultation paper. It is available [here](http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReaddata/ConsultationPaper/Document/Net_Neutality_Preconsultation_30_may_2016.pdf) (PDF!).

The following are the questions it asks, along with my responses.
---
Robert J Ravi  
Advisor (QoS)  
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India   
Mahanagar Door Sanchar Bhawan  
JL Nehru Marg, New Delhi—11002  
India  

Sir,

I thank you for the opportunity to respond to this pre-consultation paper on net neutrality. At the outset, I request that my email ID not be disclosed on the TRAI website.

Please find below my response to the questions posed in the paper.

**Q1. What should be regarded as the core principles of net neutrality in the Indian context? What are the key issues that are required to be considered so that the principles of net neutrality are ensured?**

The ideal core principles are as follow:

a)	Complete non-discrimination on TSP’s part with regard to pricing, speed, or appearance^1 of web pages and services.  
b)	Complete non-discrimination with regard to platform and application. This is already covered in the TRAI’s Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services, 2016.  
c)	Complete non-discrimination with regard to **protocol**. This was not included in the Prohibition passed earlier this year. It leaves open for TSPs the ability to throttle or block VoIP, P2P, or other protocols that are detrimental to their business or contribute to network congestion.  
d)	No compromise in the above principles in response to business interest of TSPs. The onus should be on the TSP to provide services that compete with those available on the internet.  
e)	“Dumb pipes” are a must, i.e., the TSP must not shape traffic based on internet consumption patterns to the detriment of any service or website (traditional traffic management, which only wants equal QoS across websites/services should be allowed). Legal requirements of logging unencrypted data may be explored under existing laws.  

The only acceptable exceptions to the above principles must be i) access exclusively to a billing website and payment gateway when the user has run out of their data plan, or when their internet connection’s billing cycle ends, and ii) for enterprise connections built for a specific purpose using CECN. The latter is already covered by the Prohibition mentioned earlier.

The key issue that must be considered is the **lack of comprehensive regulatory precedent for robust net neutrality**. Examples of this are mentioned below.

•	In the US, although there are some net neutrality regulations, the American TSP T-Mobile maintains a scheme named “Binge-On”, where subscribers can access services like Netflix, YouTube, and HBO in 480p video quality for free, whereas other internet traffic is metred regularly. The US lacks the regulatory instruments to stop this discriminatory practice.

•	In Japan, the Guideline for Packet Shaping gives ISPs the power to penalize or discriminate users who use a lot of data. This is a dangerous power to give ISPs. In India, the issue of network congestion by a minority of broadband users has been resolved with data caps, which won’t be needed, hopefully, in the future as network infrastructure expands to accommodate all levels of usage.

•	In Brazil, traffic shaping is allowed under “extreme circumstances” of technical requirement, which TSPs may themselves determine. This potentially allows ISPs to throttle websites, services, or protocols (specifically P2P).

•	The European Union’s regulations allow member states to permit zero-rating.

Therefore, India has the opportunity to be a **regulatory pioneer** by adopting comprehensive net neutrality laws that are forward-looking and fair.

**Q2. What are the reasonable traffic management practices that may need to be followed by TSPs while providing Internet access services and in what manner could these be misused? Are there any other current or potential practices in India that may give rise to concerns about net neutrality?**

Traditional traffic management practices that ensure equal quality of service for all websites, services, applications, platforms, and protocols must be the only type that is allowed. Any practice that artificially modifies the performance, speed, or appearance of the mentioned factors must not be allowed.

Around the world, large internet companies that account for a significant percentage of internet traffic are often burdened to work with ISPs to ensure fair quality of service for consumers. Google, for example, has Google Edge^2, a peering network that ISPs can use to connect directly with Google’s data centres. Netflix^3, the world’s largest internet TV network, also maintains an Open Connect program  in which they give out free copies of their entire video catalogue to ISPs, so that the latter don’t have to bear the cost of downloading video streams from Netflix’s servers.

As video consumption grows in India, as mentioned in the consultation paper, it must be emphasized that internet providers, not internet companies, must bear the brunt of maintaining equal quality of service. Otherwise, it may become standard for large internet companies to resort to partnerships with ISPs to ensure adequate quality of service.

A current (undeclared) practice of violating net neutrality is practiced by Airtel. After a data plan runs out on a prepaid mobile connection, WhatsApp continues to work, even as the rest of the internet redirects to Airtel’s billing page. This must be stopped.

**Q3. What should be India’s policy and/or regulatory approach in dealing with issues relating to net neutrality? Please comment with justifications.**

Since a violation of net neutrality threatens the very foundations of the Internet, delicensing of an ISP must be the only regulatory response to repeat violators.

Due to the decentralized nature of ISPs, network administrators at various levels might use traffic management techniques that violate net neutrality. Having delicensing as retaliation for this will ensure organizational discipline at all levels to respect net neutrality.

**Q4. What precautions must be taken with respect to the activities of TSPs and content providers to ensure that national security interests are preserved? Please comment with justification.**

While there needs to be a balance between individual privacy and national security, aside from obtaining legal warrants for specific connections under suspicion, there must be minimal state intervention. Since VPNs and messengers with end-to-end encryptions are widely available and continue to proliferate, a “blanket” of requirements to TSPs (such as logging websites visited by consumers) is both undesirable and unlikely to succeed.

As for content providers, existing laws and reporting systems exist to block access to websites.

**Q5. What precautions must be taken with respect to the activities of TSPs and content providers to maintain customer privacy? Please comment with justification.**

Dumb pipes must be maintained, with the exception of knowing which subscriber an IP address corresponds to.
Logging of internet activity must be avoided as far as possible, for reasons mentioned in the answer to the previous question.

**Q6. What further issues should be considered for a comprehensive policy framework for defining the relationship between TSPs and OTT content providers?**

It is not far-fetched to say that most calling and text communication will happen over the internet within the next decade. This transition is currently underway. As VoLTE is supported by an increasing number of handsets, it is important that net neutrality laws with regard to VoIP are forward-looking, and not concerned with the immediate business concerns of telecom companies.^4

By yielding to these complaints, the Regulator might risk slowing down the penetration of internet and the evolution of network infrastructure. This is entirely undesirable, considering the hitherto slow evolution of ISPs’ quality of service. And seeing how the growth of the internet is inextricably linked to the growth of the economy, net neutrality laws must be robust. OTT services must therefore not be limited in any way to accommodate TSPs.

Thanking you,  
shadowbannedguy1

**Footnotes**

^1 An example of violating appearance neutrality is modifying the contents of a page by changing the packets in transit, or adding new information. BSNL and MTNL, for example, insert ads into regular HTTP pages as a popup.  
^2 https://peering.google.com  
^3 https://openconnect.netflix.com  
^4 A possible area of regulation, however, for VoIP, is when a VoIP device calls a traditional telephone over landline or wireless calling networks. This issue needs a consultation paper of its own.",shadowbannedguy1," Really makes you think doesn't it?  
I might be using my tinfoil hat a bit excessively here but the last three(?) agitations vs net neutrality were spearheaded by AIB.  
Now, someone picks up a video from Tanmay Bhat's snapchat and puts it on Youtube setting off a series of events which sends the AIB members in hiding and forces them to keep a low profile in fear of the wrath of the MNS.  
Coincidentally, this entire fiasco happens round about the same time when TRAI has come up with a new Net Neutrality consultation!  
The *Chakravyuha* is turning again...can we break it this time round? as /u/Hellkane said, they will keep repeating this shit until people lose interest and the law gets passed in favour of the telcos. How we need a person like Tom Wheeler of the FCC in TRAI to fuck the asses of these telcos. God save the country from inept bureaucracy.


Edit- spelling. In Q1 you can write about the overhaul of NIXI to allow content providers peer directly and openly. TRAI must make it mandatory for networks, both ISPs and content providers, to peer openly at public exchanges in the country. No participants should get billed for traffic exchange. However, maintenance fees can be callected and exchange should be run on a non-profit basis.

Also private entities should be allowed to open exchanges.

A consortium, with equal representation from ISPs and  content providers, should be established to look into how traffic can be pushed with the best possible QOS and least cost to customers. Special preference should be given to smaller ISPs and content providers to prevent monopolistic practcies. [deleted] Hey, this is great stuff. Have you submitted something on the Free Data paper yet? Deadline is June 16th. Is this a weekly thing or monthly?

###Headline Stories
***

**WANTED: RBI Governor**

Alright, you knew this was coming. You don’t live under a rock. You’ve heard about this. We have had wall to wall coverage of this story since it broke. And as the most important economic story of the week, it has to be talked about here. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan does not [want](http://in.reuters.com/article/rbi-chief-rajan-quit-idINKCN0Z50N2) a second term. In a message to the RBI staff that was released on the central bank’s website, Rajan has stated his desire to not continue as the governor. Instead, he’s going back to his old teaching job in the US. Apparently, the governor was very much interested in serving a second term. But getting reappointed would mean that he would have to maneuver the delicate political minefield. And Rajan was unwilling to get down and dirty in the intricate interlockings of Indian politics, which has now become more complex than the plot of Game of Thrones. And so, the House of Rajan will now be leaving the show in September. This decision to not continue marks a political victory for the campaign against his reappointment, which was led by Subramanium from the House of Swamy. 


**Flying Higher**

Rule 4/20 is the rule that states you must smoke a little something when the clock strikes 4:20. Rule 5/20 is not as exciting or fun, and only applies to the Indian aviation industry. The 5/20 rule states that any Indian airliner must have 5 years of experience flying domestic routes and must own 20 aircrafts before it can operate any international routes. It might sound like redundant regulation to you, but that’s not how the folks at Jet Airways and SpiceJet see this. To incumbent airliners who already satisfy the rule, this is hugely beneficial since it removes competition on international routes. But to newer airliners like Air Asia who don’t satisfy the rule, this is a lost business opportunity. But a new civil aviation policy approved last week [removed](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-airlines-rules-idINKCN0Z110J) the 5-year experience requirement, however the 20 aircraft rule still stands, making it the 0/20 rule. A big round of FDI reforms has also eased rules for FDI in the aviation industry.

**EU & Britain - The Big Divorce**

Britain, the real reason why Indians love tea and cricket, is going through a messy divorce. In a nation-wide referendum, Britishers will soon vote if they want the country to leave the European Union or stay in the European Union. A popular argument for staying in the EU cites the disastrous effects that the British economy is expected to experience if it leaves. The UK Treasury [says](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/macro-view/talking-point-brexit-and-indian-markets/article8748796.ece) that if Britain leaves, inflation will spike, unemployment will rise, and GDP growth might be 6% lower. But let’s be honest, most of you can’t be bothered to keep up with even the Indian economy. The news is boring, uninteresting, mundane and all the other synonyms of boring. And here is a story asking you to care about the British economy. So before you tune out, know that you should care about this because the global economy is a series of dominos, and one of them might fall next week. Most of the world is urging Britain to stay in the EU. But really, the only evidence that anyone needs to take into consideration is - Donald Trump supports Britain leaving the EU. And that right there, should be enough information for the British people to know which way to vote.

**STILL WANTED: RBI Governor**

You know what? We haven’t talked about this enough. This story deserves another look. The big news of Rajan’s departure was dropped in an open letter that Rajan wrote to the RBI staff. And it caught everyone off-guard, including the government. While Rajan gets ready for his exit interview, the government is busy looking at résumés of candidates to fill his position. The news of his departure isn’t even a week old, but the race to replace him is already starting to heat up. The shortlist has as many as [seven](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/seven-names-on-long-list-to-replace-rbis-rajan-official-1420762) people, but the frontrunner right now is Arundhati Bhattacharya, a high-profile banker who has been at the helm of India's largest lender - State Bank of India. If you think you can make the shortlist, send your CV to: Sansad Marg, Janpath, New Delhi, Delhi 110001. Either way, get ready to bid farewell to Rajan. It sure was good while it lasted, wasn’t it? But like all good things in life, it had to come to an end. Rajan, we had a lot of fun together, didn’t we? Remember when you cut consumer inflation from a high of 11.16% to a low of 3.69%? Yeah.. Good times. And remember when you increased the foreign exchange reserves from $275 billion to $363 billion? Yeah... Those were the days. I’m sorry, I think I need some time alone.

* To stop cheap imports of foreign wheat from messing with the domestic wheat market which employs a lot of farmers, the government levies a duty of 25% on all wheat imports. Last week, the duty which was set to expire this month was [renewed](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/180616/india-extends-25-percent-tax-on-wheat-imports-ram-vilas-paswan.html) for 3 more months. But it might not work as planned. Despite being the world’s 2nd largest producer of wheat, Indian imports of wheat could touch a decade-high this year. Well, at least the government will make a ton of cash off it.

* Technically, Amazon India is not an e-commerce company. It is an online marketplace [that](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/amazon-continues-to-lobby-for-hybrid-ecommerce-model-in-india-116061300365_1.html) connects buyers and sellers. E-commerce is when you sell inventory directly to the buyer. Current regulations don’t allow FDI in e-commerce, which means foreign companies like Amazon can’t enter the e-commerce industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently met PM Modi and lobbied him to allow FDI in e-commerce. One can only imagine how frustrated Bezos must’ve felt when they told him that last week, India [eased](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/govt-to-hold-briefing-on-fdi-rules-today/article8751887.ece) FDI rules for 9 industries including aviation, defense, pharma and food processing. Can you guess which industry didn’t make the cut?

* Larsen & Toubro has [bagged](http://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-qatar-idINKCN0YS0P2) a $135 million contract to build a stadium in Qatar for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. $135 million is a lot of money. Qatar’s economy is largely based on oil and prices are not exactly ideal right now. So if you’re wondering how they are even paying for the stadium, wonder no more - The Gulf country has cut planned spending on building hospitals by about two-thirds in 2016 following the drop in oil prices to keep expenditure on its World Cup-related projects unchanged. Those are some solid priorities right there.

* It hasn’t even been a week since the news of Rajan’s departure broke and bad news has already [started](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/wpi-inflation-rises-to-079-in-may-on-higher-food-prices/article8727957.ece) rolling in. Consumer inflation, which halved during Rajan’s tenure, came in at a 21-month high of 5.76% for the month of May. Food prices for the month went up by 7.55%, also a 21-month high. Wholesale inflation, which was negative until two months ago, came in at a 19-month high of 0.76%. RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

They say there aren’t any free lunches in the world. But at least you don’t get the bill after a free lunch. However, that might soon change. Due to some ambiguity in the GST bill as it stands right now, you could [potentially](http://www.businessinsider.in/Nothing-is-going-to-come-for-free-after-GST-is-implemented-Heres-why/articleshow/52775662.cms) end up paying taxes on things that you get for free. While it is highly unlikely that this goes through, this could spell the end of all those ‘Buy One, Get One Free’ offers that businesses use to kill two birds with one stone - get some solid goodwill with consumers, and get rid of old merchandise.

For a lot of Indians, the festival that brings families and friends together is no longer Diwali. It’s the festival of IPL. The sporting franchise recently concluded its 9th season this year. And it [raked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ipl-is-a-money-spinner-as-it-amasses-rs-2500-crore-in-its-ninth-season/articleshow/52720049.cms) in ₹2,500 crore in overall revenue from advertising, sponsorships, ticket sales and merchandising. A big chunk of that money, as much as ₹1,100 crore went to Sony as the official broadcaster of the IPL. With that kind of cash, it doesn’t matter which team you support or which team wins, the executives at Sony always win.

Wanted to add three links, if you are interested in knowing more about this issue:

1) The pro-Brexit people made [a nice hour long documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMxfAkxfQ0) to explain why UK should not be a part of EU. It's quite convincing, to be honest. Do watch, if you have the time and inclination.

2) John Oliver did a [sort-of anti-Brexit segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAgKHSNqxa8) on Last Week Tonight. He made some valid points too. Don't miss the little boy with a british accent singing ""Fuck you EU"" towards the end.

3) Here's [a calm and quiet discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlzpC2qFnws) on what impact Brexit will have on the global economy and India. God bless Rajya Sabha TV. Doing the real work, talking about the right things.

Thank you for this /u/DexterMilburn. The post is epic, as always! :) Yet another masterpiece delivered OP, thanks. I was hoping to find your comments on FDI easing for this week's thread. Nevertheless i shall wait for, when the master believes is a, right time.  Correct me if I am wrong but what about conflict of interest?

If KV Kamath was the front runner for selection only then will people think about it? > RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

LOL, you're in love with Rajan! Remembered how George Soros made a killing by hedging when britain left EU that time, is the situation kind of same? Did the PNB not have a bad year with epic losses in NPA's, how are their stocks so valued? Great post. Loved reading it. Keep 'em coming. Is there any particular reason behind Punjab National Bank surging? Or is it just recovering from a low earlier? Content plus humour... bright spot in r/India Thank you.

"Aadhaar linkage defeats the very purpose it is being brought in, for. Linking them to bank accounts is the best way to park black money, make financial transfers un-auditable and launder money.",18,6i6sn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6i6sn5/aadhaar_linkage_defeats_the_very_purpose_it_is/,5,"RBI is empowered by the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to regulate payment systems in the country. (https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/86706.pdf)

- It's payment and settlement systems requires compliance to international standards. 

- It should have access controls, be equipped with safeguards to prevent external intrusions, provide audit trails. (http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs98.pdf). 

Electronic funds transfers includes point of sale transfers, ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawal of funds, transfers initiated by telephone, internet and, card payments. 

- For over a decade banks have used RBI’s own payment system NEFT to facilitate your online money transfers (https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=2346). 

- Your money is transferred to the recipient's account in hourly schedules to settle payables & receivables from each bank from in that hour. In case, your transfer fails, your money is back in your account. 

- If you make larger transfers, say Rs2 lakh and above, then you will have to use RBI’s RTGS to make the transfer(https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=65). In this case the gross amount is moved from your account to the recipient account directly. In case the transaction fails your money is reversed back to you. 

- You need to be logged into your bank account to initiate an NEFT or RTGS transfers. Only a valid bank account can receive funds making electronic transfers the bank and the trace of money cannot be altered. 

- As NEFT & RTGS transfers leave a audit trail that cannot be altered they cannot be used for money laundering. 

Aadhaar-Enabled Payment System or AEPS facilitates deposit & withdrawal from Aadhaar-Enabled Bank Accounts (AEBA)[https://authportal.uidai.gov.in/home-articles?urlTitle=aadhaar-enabled-payments]. AEPS must be licensed by RBI under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. National Payments Corp of India or NPCI, a non government public company, runs the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS)(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCqjSA1WsAAU6_H.jpg). UIDAI has a MOU with NPCI. UIDAI has no responsibility for your transactions & NPCI has no obligation to RBI. AEPS facilitates the withdrawal & deposit of money from AEBA accounts or bank accounts where an Aadhaar number is linked to the bank account. Linking Aadhaar to a bank account is done through a process called as “seeding” an Aadhaar number to a bank account. After receiving the Aadhaar number from the customer, the bank uploads such numbers’ into a “NPCI mapper” or a repository of Aadhaar numbers. The NPCI mapper is used for the purpose of routing transactions to the destination banks. The NPCI mapper contains Aadhaar number & IIN, a unique 6-digit number issued by NPCI to the participating bank [NPCI FAQ on AEPS](http://www.npci.org.in/documents/CustomerFAQs.pdf). If anyone seeds a new bank AC with your Aadhaar only that banks’ IIN will be associated with the Aadhaar(http://www.iba.org.in/upload/MicroATM_Standards_v1.5.1_Clean.pdf). Once Aadhaar enabled, you can make money transfers from your AEBA by providing the source and destination IIN and Aadhaar number. It is not impossible for anyone in possession of your Aadhaar to open multiple accounts linked to your Aadhaar. It is therefore possible for alternate accounts to receive money transferred to your Aadhaar & then point the mapper back to your original account. This destroys the trace of which account the money was deposited to or even came from. Such un-traceability allows different accounts to “park” money at different times or even become conduits for money transfers. Such accounts can also become conduits to claim undeserved benefits from Consolidated Fund of India that would never be traced once released. Such a system would make it near impossible to detect fraud & crime. This is a recipe for embezzling government treasury with no complaints, no audit trail and no punishment. Bankers call any transactions that are not traceable as money laundering. Aadhaar Leaks exposed hundreds of million Aadhaar numbers & bank accounts that exposing them to such misuse. Even if Aadhaar numbers were proof of identity, which it is not, linking them to bank accounts is the best way to park black money, make financial transfers un-auditable, propagate money laundering and financial fraud. By enabling Aadhaar linkages with bank accounts, the government is enabling fraud propagation across the entire banking industry that will result in widespread and irreversible damage. 

PIL 932/2013 not heard since 2013 before the SC has challenged Aadhaar linkages to banking and prayed for delinking Aadhaar from banking. If this investigation into Aadhaar linkage is not sufficient to make a prudent banker lose sleep, we may not have any prudent bankers left. Do our policy makers have the time or inclination to apply themselves to protecting national interest & assets? Or to reflect on the implications of their actions or to seek counsel & protect the nation and its assets? Embroiling the unbanked & banked into this mess is no financial inclusion - it is a debt warrant. The government is subverting justice by not allowing the SC to hear & judge the matter. This is not a matter of deciding privacy, it is about national interest & our economy. When impacts are not localized and non spreading, interdependence increases propagating impacts. This results in irreversible and widespread damage and the probability of devastation, ultimately to the point of certainty. Aadhaar is propagating exactly such impacts that are not localised or non-spreading. 

Containing the nations risk from “black swans” requires applying the precautionary principle.
(http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/pp2.pdf). An essential feature of a payment system is to guarantee the trace of payments should not be alterable. Another feature is that it should not be possible to freeze your bank account without recourse to redressal & justice. NEFT and RTGS are RBI’s own payment systems that have been time tested. There is no reason to switch public payments to any other payment system, particularly one run by non-government private companies. The replacement of a time tested standard under government regulation by a non-government company raises several questions. This thread is based on article previously published in Sep 2014 (http://www.moneylife.in/article/how-aadhaar-linkage-can-destroy-banks/38736.html). Scenario today worse as warnings have gone unheeded.

**Last Week On Rajan Watch**

Last year, PM Modi called RBI Governor Rajan as the “best teacher” for explaining complex economic issues to him. Days later, Rajan said the teaching went both ways. Aww. But the bromance doesn’t end there. Reports saying the PM is “proud” of Rajan surfaced last week [stating](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rajan-insight-idUSKCN0YM2SC) that any campaign against Rajan will not affect the big decision that he needs to make on Rajan’s reappointment. That might’ve been a snide reference to MP Subramanian Swamy’s moves to remove Rajan, Swamy has even rebuked Rajan for “speaking like a grandfather” (what? with artificial teeth? I mean Rajan is already 53, while Swamy is 76). Being best buds with Modi will definitely help Rajan secure his governorship at the RBI for a second term. But then, later in the day, reports [surfaced](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-doesnt-want-extension-media-report/articleshow/52536142.cms) that Rajan doesn’t even want to continue as Governor and would rather be a spectator in the game by going back to teach in the US and continue research on the Indian economy. Apparently, his family has already left. Somebody better buy the rights to this reality show - I’m personally hanging by the edge of my seat. Rajan is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the interest rate meeting this week. And the markets are expected to worry more about the “Rexit” - Rajan exiting the RBI than the interest rates this week. 

**Lincoln Could Only Do So Much**

When you have North Korea, Uzbekistan, Cambodia and Qatar at the top of a list - you pretty much know that the it isn’t the list of world’s happiest countries, it just has to be a list about something bad. Last week, India [shared](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-18-35-million-people-india-tops-global-slavery-index-1413891) a spot on such a list with all of these countries and it was the list that ranks countries in terms of slavery. Yikes. Owning a person might’ve gone out of fashion decades ago, but the trend is still alive - With a global figure of 46 million modern-day slaves, India is home to 18 million of those modern-day slaves followed by 3 million in China and 2 million in Pakistan that are implicated in domestic work, prostitution, manual labour, forced begging and so on. Even in manufacturing, working conditions at factories contribute a lot to the problem by essentially turning employees into slaves. Prominent for workplace [violations](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/01/gap-walmart-factory-workers-exploited-and-abused-in-india) are factories that supply global multinationals like Walmart or Gap. They’ve been known to have working conditions that don’t just border on exploitation - but are miles away from that border, deep into exploitation territory. Complaints include non-payment of wages, forced overtime work, inability to form unions, extreme health consequences that may be fatal due to lack of safety regulations and even sexual harassment. How’s that 9-to-5 desk job sounding now?


**Follow The Money?**

In 2014, between the time when Modi was elected and the time when Modi was sworn-in as the PM, the Sensex was [up](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/narendra-modi-vs-bse-sensex/) 1,685 points. Clearly, the stock market loves Modi. But Modi thinks of the stock market as just a friend. Asset disclosures have [revealed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pm-modi-top-ministers-stay-clear-of-stocks-keep-assets-in-realty-banks/articleshow/52413153.cms) that the PM has 79% of his total assets, which amount to a total of ₹26.1 lakh, in real estate and a big fat 0% in stocks. The stock market was friend-zoned not just by the PM, but by his cabinet as well. While the total assets of the top 9 ministers in the Indian government amounted to a staggering ₹91.1 crore, only 2% of them were invested in the stock market. The richest of the bunch was Arun Jaitley, perhaps appropriately the Finance Minister, who has total assets of ₹49.5 crore, a significant portion of which is just cold hard cash sitting as bank deposits. The poorest of the bunch was Suresh Prabhu, perhaps also appropriately the Railway Minister, who has total assets of mere ₹17 lakh. You want to talk about the gap between the rich and the poor? We’ve got that gap right here for you in government’s *navratnas*. 

**Time for Tim: Cook’s India Aftermath**

Tim came, Tim saw but Tim did not conquer. Tim Cook, Apple CEO, visited India a few weeks ago to much media fanfare and met several top government ministers. But to Tim’s disappointment, he failed to convince anyone to allow Apple to launch its famous retail iStores in India. Currently, Apple sells products through a network of dealers. That’s because under current regulations, if Apple wants to open retail stores, it needs to source 30% of content locally. Sourcing 30% locally means Apple would have to start manufacturing in India. Either that, or just buy stuff from local businesses and literally light it on fire. Neither of those things is about to happen. However, under current regulations, Apple can be granted a waiver to the 30% rule but only if Apple is bringing “cutting-edge” technology to India. And in the classic bureaucratic fashion, nobody actually bothered to define what “cutting-edge” would mean. And when you leave crucial terms like that open for interpretation, somewhere somehow a lawyer gets all excited. Now, Apple fanboys might disagree on this but government officials are unlikely to call any of Apple’s technology “cutting-edge” and are widely [expected](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/lDn53REhqvhqGoIxs9MgwJ/Apples-proposal-to-sell-refurbished-iPhones-in-India-reject.html) to decline Apple’s petition for a waiver of the 30% rule. The government is also not a big fan of Apple’s proposal to sell second-hand iPhones in India fearing that the country would become a graveyard for all old iPhones.

Pouting for a selfie on Facebook might’ve been pretty much meaningless till now. But no more. Taking inspiration from the tax officials who’ve been using social media photos to extract information from tax evaders, some banks and financial institutions have [started](http://www.ibtimes.co.in/popularity-facebook-linkedin-might-just-make-it-easier-get-loans-now-680625) using your social worth on Facebook, LinkedIn and Google Plus to process loans and determine if you'll pay them back or not. Great, just one more reason for your mother to get on Facebook and post your embarrassing childhood photos to your wall. All those vague statuses, stupid check-ins don’t seem so bad now, do they?

There’s a job that the Swiss Government wants all Swiss citizens to do. And it’s ready to shell out the big bucks. How big? ₹1.7 lakh per month. It offers decent hours, doesn’t need special training and isn’t dangerous. But Swiss citizens voted with an overwhelming majority and declined the job offer. Now that I have your attention, the job isn’t tiring or gross either. The job is ...to exist. Swiss citizens [voted](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36454060) down a universal income proposal that would guarantee a minimum income of ₹1.7 lakh/month to every Swiss citizen. Uninformed sources say, the government has decided to use that money to set up much needed mental health checkup facilities in the country.

**Return Of The Avengers**

Whoever says Hollywood’s superhero movies are unrealistic? The Avengers are actually real. Hollywood’s Avengers was a group of superheroes saving the universe by blowing stuff up. In reality, the Avengers are a group of guys that just blow stuff up for no real reason. The Niger Delta Avengers militant group has been [blowing](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/oil-hovers-near-8-month-highs-on-us-inventory-draw.html) up oil wells in Nigeria and has rejected any peace talks with the government. After dropping to dangerous lows of $20, crude oil prices have bounced back and recently crossed the $50 mark. Much of the reason for this rise is simply the forces of supply and demand reacting to each other in a free market. But one of the reasons it touched $50 last week was the Avengers sabotaging oil wells. A lot of investors betting on the resurgence of oil can’t say this out loud, but thank god for terrorist Avengers. However, not everybody is celebrating the return of oil. In the latest policy review, the RBI (which kept interest rates untouched last week), [cited](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/black-gold-a-headache-not-only-for-modi-but-for-raghuram-rajan-too/articleshow/52634156.cms) rising oil prices as a risk. Because when oil prices go up, inflation goes up as well. Personally, I’m just sad that budget cuts forced the Avengers to opt for simple dynamite instead of nuclear-powered Mach-5 flying suits.

**Black Problems**

India has a huge second economy that deals with black money. That’s news to nobody. But a new study has [pegged](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/new-study-pegs-black-money-in-india-at-rs-30-lakh-crore/story/233395.html) the size of that black economy at an astounding 20% of GDP or over ₹30 lakh crore (that’s 3 followed by 13 zeroes). And that just happens to be bigger than the overall economic size of countries like Thailand or Argentina. While the size of India’s black economy expanded rapidly during the 70s and 80s, it has been gradually declining since then. Today, most of this money is locked up in physical assets like real estate or gold. Due to obvious reasons, there are no official figures but experts say that as much as 30% of India’s real estate sector is funded by black money. Really, only in economics can you root for the supremacy of white over black and not be called a ~~Donald Trump supporter~~ racist.

**The Curious Case Of Missing GDP**

How does a 7.9% growth in GDP sound to you? If you ask the average joe on the streets, he won’t know what is what. But if you ask the fairly well-read joe on the streets, he’ll tell you that a 7.9% growth rate is amazing. But what about a 3.9% growth in GDP? Now, that’s bad. Official numbers released last week say that India’s GDP in the March quarter grew by 7.9%. But wait, there’s more. The accuracy of those numbers has been [called](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/kvvDHfbryOQjvu2l16UcEI/Discrepancies-drive-GDP-growth.html) into question. When you break GDP down into its components, sometimes the data doesn’t add up. It’s life. Sometimes, things just don’t add up. So this gap is then plugged by calling the missing portion as a ‘discrepancy’. As long as this discrepancy doesn’t get too big, all is well. But the amount of discrepancy in the latest numbers has shot up by over 350%. And if you remove the amount put under ‘discrepancy’, GDP growth rate falls from 7.9% to 3.9%. Faking GDP numbers? Come on guys, that’s not our job. That’s China’s [job](http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/china-fake-economic-data/).


**Economic Story Because Export and Import**

Nuclear weapons are serious business. Emphasis on serious rather than business. Although a handful of companies do make money off the nuclear power business. When sensitive nuclear technology falls in the wrong hands, you have rogue nations like North Korea and when it falls in the right hands... well, there really aren’t any right hands for nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a group of 48-countries that controls the export and import of goods that can be used to make a nuclear weapon. The NSG does this to ensure that nuclear technology doesn’t fall in the wrong hands. But India is not one of its 48 members. One of the reasons we are not invited to parties thrown by the NSG is because we have nuclear weapons but haven’t signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is an international agreement designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. This is a sore point with a lot of countries like China who are against India joining the NSG. However, being being friends with the United States, the world’s superpower does come with a lot of benefits. A US-led push to include India in the NSG is [picking](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-nuclear-idUSKCN0YV13Z) up steam as nations like South Africa and Turkey are coming around to supporting India’s bid for a membership. Here’s the irony - the only reason the NSG even exists as an international group, is because India tested nuclear weapons in the 70s and that rustled some jimmies in the international community.

Earlier this year, the Indian government once again tried to get the famed Kohinoor diamond back from the UK and failed. Citing that it would set an “unworkable precedent”, UK Prime Minister David Cameron [refused](http://www.newsweek.com/kohinoor-diamond-india-colonialism-449951) to return the stone, which has been claimed by the governments of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan at various points as well. That didn’t pan out quite well. But how do 200 statues and sculptures sound instead of 1 big fat diamond? The US  is [returning](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/07/us/stolen-artifacts-returned-india/) more than 200 artifacts that were stolen and smuggled out and eventually just ended up in the hands of the US government. Some of them are as old as 2,000 years and are worth over $100 million.

The government has, for the first time in history, [declared](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/03/india-will-have-surplus-power-for-the-first-time-ever-report) that it will not have a shortage of electricity this year. Baring the small matter of authorities often choosing to black out certain areas to hide demand, from June onwards, the country will have more electricity than required. Psh. Power cut. Shmower Cut.

Yes, because they are required by U.S. law to do so. That they chose the opportune moment and occasion is because they are also the world's largest PR agency. >When you break GDP down into its components, sometimes the data doesn’t add up. It’s life. Sometimes, things just don’t add up. So this gap is then plugged by calling the missing portion as a ‘discrepancy’. 

This is absolute bollocks. I don't think you don't know what the discrepancy term means. Why are you misleading people?

For those who don't know, ""discrepancy"" is just the difference between the two estimates of GDP the government gets using two different methods – expenditures method and GVA method. Both the calculations are done by the government only, and therefore there is no inherent reason to trust one number more than the other.

In fact, according to some economists, the expenditures data on quarterly basis is pretty shabby and unreliable, so that is the one we should be deemed less trustworthy. I would give it to OP, because the discrepancy data is being qouted around quite a lot. It's not a good thing, but it certainly doesn't mean the GDP is infact 3.9%
In a country like india, its tough to find the numbers collected through expenditure, and hence we, like most countries, report production (read GVA) numbers as our GDP. Ideally they should be equal (infact, production, expenditure and income approach should reach the same number. The difference is reported as a discrepancy.

While it is indeed curious as to why did it skyrocket to that figure in this qaurter, it doesn't automatically discredit GDP figures. Infact, there are worse things going on to discredit it (WPI use in deflator, profits vs sales numbers, GVA in manufacturing and IIP numbers)

Though, this discussion is subpar, the discrepancy portion is tackled very well. Give it a hear.

Winter Session of Parliament begins today! Here are a few resources for Parliament watchers and political enthusiasts to aid them in following this session.,83,5d7na6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5d7na6/winter_session_of_parliament_begins_today_here/,10,"Hello /r/India,

Haven't been posting here for a while because I am now doing a weekly column with Newslaundry. (Self-promotion is not allowed on /r/india). 

But I want to take a chance just this once (if the mods permit) and share some interesting things me & others in this space have been working on. Hopefully, it will help you gain some perspective on what is happening in our Parliament.

**Winter session of Parliament commences today!**

*Does a little jig*

My 'Last Week in Parliament' series shall resume this Saturday on Newslaundry. Much awesomeness shall happen!

For all you good people who follow Parliament (or wish to follow Parliament), I offer you a some resources to arm yourself and watch even more closely (because I'm nice and all). 

**My stuff**

I have been writing about interesting things happening in our Parliament for the past few months (with crazy GIFs) like: Foreign funding to political parties, restructuring of the RBI, babu-power to make laws, immigration for the people of only *certain* religions etc.

A lot of the things I have written about will also find resonance in this session. Sharing a few relevant ones in this post. (The complete list of articles can be found [here](https://www.newslaundry.com/author/meghnad-s).)

- Starting with, of course, [The Great Indian Demonetization](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/11/15/the-great-indian-demonetization). The public will benefit from this move in the long term, but there is someone else who will benefit on holy-mother-of-godly-jesus levels: Indian Bankers. (Sidenote: This is actually a continuation of a post I had made here in /r/india in Feb - [Our Banks are in trouble and we need to talk about it](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/47ogw5/our_banks_are_in_trouble_we_need_to_talk_about_it/))

- [The Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/11/02/want-to-be-an-indian-citizen-its-easier-if-youre-hindu) will come up for consideration in the winter session. It has a strange provision in it. It’s will become easier to become a citizen if you’re non-Muslim. 

- Some significant rules are about to be laid in Parliament too. We need to keep a track of [what our dear babu-log are upto](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/11/09/the-power-of-babus).

- During discussions on economy & demonetization, you will hear about lowering interest rates. It is now being done in shiny new ways because the RBI has been completely restructured. [Raguram Rajan's successor is a committee!](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/08/27/raghuram-rajans-successor-is-a-committee)

- GST is going to make a comeback & there will be a lot of talk about 'Asset Reconstruction'. In the last session, the Voldemort Bill was passed which would be even more significant after demonetization. Here is [a simplified guide for both](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/08/06/the-voldemort-of-bills-got-passed-and-you-didnt-know).

- And finally, there are some very interesting Private Members' Bill that might come up this session. Marijuana legalization, Transgender Bill AND, hopefully, one more which one has a vested interest in. (*wink wink*) Here is why [PMBs are vital & need to be given importance](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/09/20/its-a-private-member-affair). 

**Other EPIC shit happening in the Policy Space**

- Take a look at the PRS Legislative Research's [pending Bills track](http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/pending/). It will let you see which are the bills that might come up for the upcoming session and what is their status in the Parliament right now. Alongwith some really good briefs, of course.

- PRS Legislative has also starting doing [video briefings for bills](http://www.prsindia.org/videos/bill-videos), which is worth checking out. 

- If you want to follow the Parliament LIVE on Twitter, go ahead and follow @HasParlAdjYet. A few good souls I know have assembled to painfully document every movement in the Parliament and document it on twitter.

- There is this new website called nyaaya.in. They are working hard to simplify complex laws for public consumption and understanding. Check out their [really good website](http://nyaaya.in/)

- A very enterprising person I know has started an effort called Maadhyam. She is giving bill briefings on pending bills and trying to get public inputs on them. She will then make briefings for MPs and circulate it to them. At the moment, [Maadhyam operates on Offprint](http://www.offprint.in/article/2322/). Do check that out as well.

- Also, Bonus Video which kinda explains [why things are the way they are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs). Rules for Rulers. Made a LOT of things clearer for me as a dispassionate (and kinda depressed) observer of the political system.

I hope these tools help you follow Parliament & makes things a little more interesting. 
Let the Hunger Games... I mean... Winter Session of Indian Parliament, commence!

Kumbhakaran


P.S. Dear Mods, pliss allow this post on /r/india. For the greater good of mankind. <3",kumbhakaran," Great writeup on demonetization! However, I'd like to get a genuine understanding of a few issues...

You said (and pls correct me if I am wrong) money going from circulation to banks will be good in the long term because banks would be able to give out loans which will result in more liquidity. However we already had that liquidity before 8th Nov. How is ""liquidity as a result of bank loans"" better than liquidity without debt?

Also more deposits in the bank will mean more interest cost (interest payable to depositors) at the same time. If that does not get offset by good performing loans (which we know there is a lack of), aren't banks going to lose even more money in future?

Wouldnt this ""temporary"" disruption in the economy make it more difficult for companies to make profits and as a result, pay back interest on their loans (to be ""good performing"")? > The public will benefit from this move in the long term

How? Thanks again for all your points and resources. The moment i know parliament sessions are going to start, was hoping the weekly summary from you on reddit .  Sharma g ye toh baat na hui I hope the opposition bring up the suffering of people due to this demonetisation thingy. The Winter Session should be dedicated to that. The Govt should be made to suffer like the people. The winter session is just 20 days, right? If it's Ok for people to suffer for just 50 days, it should Ok for the Govt to suffer for 20 days. I hope someone flings their chappals at the BJP chuts. So you like babbus biryani huh :P",Policy/Economy,2016-11-16 13:51:03
IMHO Mallya is being targeted because he flaunts his personal wealth.,100,49xeun,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/49xeun/imho_mallya_is_being_targeted_because_he_flaunts/,30,"Now lest we jump the gun on the title, I know he gave a personal guarantee on the loan. I know he was the promoter of the erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines. But you have to see that the same public banks who are now crying hoarse are the ones who decided to give him a second loan in 2010? 

Now we can say that he is an asshole, yes in the layman's perspective he is an asshole. But lets not forget its his personal wealth, not the company's. That is the basic premise of a corporate body, that you limit your liability to the extent you are part of the company. (I know personal guarantee and all). The same banks AFAIK, took equity in the company.

What we as a nation need to ask is, what is the liability of these banks? Not as equity holders, but as lenders, how is it that ICICI was able to sell its part of the distressed pie to an asset reconstruction company while our public banks were seen staring into space holding their weiners. Another issue here is Mallya afaik was lent in a more open and straightforward manner, whereas there are company's with private subsidiaries to which borrowed money was routed to and it disappeared, while their listed parents defaulted, mostly in infra projects. Here the Banks lent money in the false hope that the airline would turn around in that economy, which obviously it did not. 

Now to indulge in some whataboutism, why is it that other huge defaulters are not talked of? Are the banks acting on media pressure? Why should they act on it? 

At least I hope because of Mallya ji, there will be a debate on why there are such defaulters, and the Banks have to be bailed out with our money, as was done in this budget. 

We also need to get policy in place to prevent lending of bad loans in the future. Lest Banks stop lending altogether and then we have a huge problem at our hands. 

Remember its your money, there are other people too who have  it, not just the Mallyas.",Corporatevakeel," Most Indians here and elsewhere have no idea how corporate structures actually work

Some guy was arguing that Mallaya was the ""owner"" of Kingfisher.

I had to explain that that's not how corporate entities work. When I start a Pvt. Ltd., I immediately decouple myself from the business. 

And no, there is never a single ""owner"" or a Pvt or Public Ltd. company. Heck, you need a minimum of 2 directors to even start a Pvt. Ltd. It's not a dukaan. It doesn't have a sole owner. If you owned even a single share in Kingfisher, you'd be called an 'owner' of the company too > But you have to see that the same public banks who are now crying hoarse are the ones who decided to give him a second loan in 2010?

I'm probably going to be unpopular for this opinion, but the banks were not that wrong in providing additional loans to KF Airlines. 

At that time, the airline was already deep into losses. The assets did not even come close to covering the cost of the loan. The banks therefore could do one of two things - either call the loans and end up recovering 10% of the loan amount, or they could pony up some more cash in exchange for equity and backed by some additional assets and a personal guarantee and hope that the situation would improve. As can be seen by other airlines' financial performance lately, the situation did improve but it was too late for KF.

Regular people invest in business this way too ... ""I've lent 20 lacs to my son for my son's business that's not doing too well. If I liquidate the business, there's a 100% probability that I'll never see the 20 lacs again. If I pump in another 2-3 lacs, there's a 20% chance of the business turning around and I might recover the entire 22 lacs.""

> But lets not forget its his personal wealth, not the company's. That is the basic premise of a corporate body, that you limit your liability to the extent you are part of the company. (I know personal guarantee and all)

That's the whole point. If he hadn't given the personal guarantee, he would not be legally liable to repay the loan. 

BTW does anyone have any figures on the amount that was backed by the personal guarantee? I doubt that it would cover the entire loan or even a part of the second loan. Obviously, he is being targeted because of this. There are many other businessmen with impeccable personality, who have also racked u NPAs by the 1000s of crores. But then, this doesn't mean Mallya should not be targeted. He deserves much worse for being an idiot. Mallya is targetted because he is flashy and attracts attention. He was close to all politicians but now he has become a BJP guy because it suits the narrative which the media is trying to push. So many loans were given out by PSU banks to infrastructure companies which were close to UPA politicans during the UPA regime. The largest p ercentage of NPAs are in the infrastructure sector.

And people don't understand or ignore the difference between an individual and a corporation. It should be the media's job to educate people on such issues but media is too busy generating outrage and pushing its own agenda. The probability of a loan going bad is hard to determine. However, the recourse in case of such bad loans, namely the security is pretty straightforward. In the present case, certain IP of the company was valued at around 3k crores. These are  not the famous  Kingfisher beer trademarks, but lesser known trademarks of the airlines. Today, as the airline is defunct and has depleted it's goodwill, I wonder how valuable the IP is today. Personal Guarantee is a viable option but a time taking process to enforce. 


However, the most important aspect is to look into the credit analysis that the banks relied upon. Also, it's time to formulate a set of regulations in relation to lending to companies which are connected to or promoted by MPs and MLAs. There's a company the jaypee group which has about 70k crore I'm debt and can't pay it back way worse than mallya IMO he is not being targeted primarily because of his defaults and his lifestyle. Its not even because of the legal structure of his companies or his political affiliations or lack of those. 

All those play a part but only on the margin.

He is being targeted because he has shut down or sold off his stake and control in his companies. He has no continuing business which can provide hopes to banks of some recovery like say JP group and Essar (which are much bigger defaulters). He has monetized his businesses and the only hope of recovery is either trying to seize that cash (if something is left) or put pressure on him to pay from wherever he can.  He is surely targeted for this personal wealth and his high visibility. But a few of things to keep in perspective:

1) ""Personal Guarantee"" means just that - it extends beyond the corporate structure and lenders have the right to go after entire personal wealth of the guarantor.^1 He got those loans only because of his personal guarantee and having given that his entire personal wealth is, in fact, now fair game. 

2) He has done lot of ""shady stuff"" you mention
I) Overseas Trust Funds: If reports about ED investigation are to be believed he diverted lot of funds from KF Air to overseas trusts in jurisdictions (Panama and Isle of Man)  where India has limited reach.
In effect, when KF was a sureshot goner, he squirreled away whatever money was left. The lenders had the right over that money.

II) United Spirits: *After he sold off major stake in that company* he used his chairmanship in United Spirits in following ways
a) To give loans to his other companies. He concealed the true beneficiaries of those loans from the new shareholders.
b) He got more loans for his sick companies on guarantees of United Spirits.
Of course for both the above points, one can question the competency of the new shareholders who cannot control their chairman and/or their internal checks and balances. 

But you are right, we should step back from all the persecution and learn some lessons as a nation. Imho, the following can be takeaways

1) Government should not be in the business of lending in the long term.

I add ""in the long term"" as currently state banks perform a societal good by their presence in the most remote areas of the country where profit-making banks would not bother to venture.
Bandhan Financials (which got a bank licence recently) has proved that even this can be done much better by non-governmental institutes, such institutes should be identified and over the next decade or so, government stake in banks should be divested. 

2) Better bankruptcy laws

If we had saner ways for banks to take over sick / defaulting companies without risking a multi-decade lawsuits, the last few rounds of lending to KF Air would never have happened. The banks could have (assuming they were not ""influenced"") taken over the company and sold it off either peicemeal or as a whole to appropriate buyers. 

3) Business people should be very very vary of the temptation to attribute all of their successes to their own greatness!

>A personal guarantee, almost by definition, is unsecured, which means it is an amount not tied to any specific asset such as a residence. By making a guarantee, however, you are are putting yourself - and your assets - on the hook, by acting as the loan's cosigner. If your business dissolves, you will be responsible for repayment. Creditors will go after you in the event that your business fails to repay the loan. OP, tell frankly, you don't want the Kingfisher Calendar to go away, do you? There are many reasons he is being targeted. Kulcha warriors can't have a playboy in this country. A rich many having sex outside the tradition of marriage, oh my, that is a sin. Secondly, they are unwilling to publish the names of black money holders in this country worth *trillions* of dollars. Many of them are the funders of modi. So, they need a scapegoat to divert people's attention. He seems to fit the bill. Thirdly, modi and his cronies are safe. That is the message they are sending. So bloody what , Masses aren't supposed to know about technicalities of NPA and bad loans .

It would be difficult for corrupt politicians and bankers to give easy loans to such people . In long run , the more we give shit to govt. , the better it is .

Infact Mallya isn't being targeted enough , i think he had money-honey relations with a lot of media-political parties

**Going Gaga Over GST**

Last week, the Rajya Sabha [passed](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/gst-bill-pass-what-next-step-by-step-until-the-rollout-2952723/) the Goods and Services Tax (GST) - the tax reform that has been heralded as the most important piece of legislation in over a decade. While the common market of Europe is walking backwards due to Brexit, the common market within India is stepping ahead due to GST. The bill has been the subject of political bickering for a long time now. However, it was passed with 203 votes for and none against. With 0 votes against. They didn’t even blink twice, so you know there families weren’t being held hostage and all votes were entirely voluntary. But this has only been the tip of the iceberg. Even though both houses of the parliament have passed the bill, there is a laundry list of things that need to happen before we can all go home and forget about this whole GST business. The Lok Sabha needs to approve the bill once again. Then, a minimum of 15 state governments need to pass the bill. Then, the president needs to sign the bill. Then, a GST Council needs to be formed and the GST tax rate needs to be negotiated. Then, the central government needs to pass two supporting laws, and each state needs to pass a separate supporting law. And only then, we’ll be able to pocket all that cash from the GST-led economic growth that is being predicted. The deadline set for all of this is April 1st, 2017. Till then, government officials around the country are set to debate on extremely sensitive issues like whether cream biscuits should be taxed at the same rate as ordinary biscuits. #TeamBourbon.

**Uber-Didi**

Uber joined the long list of American MNCs that came to do business in China but inevitably fell on their faces. In a deal announced last week, the popular ride-hailing service will sell its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in [exchange](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/business/dealbook/china-uber-didi-chuxing.html?_r=0) for a 20% stake in Didi, who will invest $1 billion in Uber. The two giants have been battling for the Chinese market for years and despite spending billions of dollars, no one has managed to turn a profit. In fact, Uber was facing a loss of $1 billion annually due to heavy competition in China. Once upon a time, Uber’s future in China seemed to hold promise. And now, the company is throwing in the towel. The company’s mistake? It tried to fight a land war in Asia. Although Didi was the bigger company in China in terms of market share, Uber did have its moments. Such as when a Chinese hip-hop artist posted a gangster rap song about how much he prefers Uber. Don’t Baidu it - China being China censored the whole thing just days later.

**Loans For *Pani Puri wala*s**

Banks use all sorts of fancy algorithms to determine if a borrower will repay a loan. Despite all of that, with the banking crisis, a huge amount of loans are at a risk of being Vijay Mallya-ed. So the fancy algorithms haven’t exactly worked out. Another one of those fancy things that banks use is a credit score. A good credit score will have banks lining outside your door shouting for your attention. A bad credit score will have you lining outside the door of the banks with a ton of paperwork. You need a good credit score to get loans. But to get a good credit score, you need to repay loans. So you see the chicken-and-egg problem here. This means a lot of people don’t even have credit scores. But those people still need loans. And banks won’t touch them with a ten-foot pole. Now, microfinance companies like Edelweiss, Bharat Financial, DHFL and many more are going places feared by the big boys of finance. A big push in the industry is to loan [money](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/saturated-cities-now-even-idli-vada-seller-can-get-loan/articleshow/53515598.cms) to pavement hawkers, scrap dealers and other self-employed individuals. For example - the makers of the extremely healthy chinese food at the hand-kart that parks near the local sewer every evening. Basically, giving loans to low-income borrowers without a credit score or any kind of formal financial history. If that sounds like a recipe for trouble, that’s because it is and we’ve already had that dish in the run-up of the financial crisis of 2008. And if history isn’t repeating itself here, it’s definitely rhyming.


**Too Many Branches Spoil The Bank**

The State Bank Of India has almost 17,000 branches which is very impressive. Especially since they get to brag about it in tables that rank banks by number of branches. But the bank isn’t doing itself any favours by putting 5 branches within a 1 km radius of each other, as is the case a lot of times with SBI. Because sometimes, it’s not the size that matters, it’s what you do with it that matters. And SBI is [considering](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-weighs-plan-to-shut-relocate-30-of-its-branches/articleshow/53494912.cms) a proposal to do away with such extra branches by consolidating them. It might make common sense to shut down branches when put like that, but then they won’t get to brag about how many branches they have. And investors love those kind of things. SBI is currently in the process of merging with its associate banks from Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore and so on. It expects to have that completed by March 2017. At which point, that 17,000 number will balloon up to 24,000 branches, compounding that problem. A global consulting firm, McKinsey which was hired by SBI has recommended shutting down upto of 7,200 of those branches. Moreover, bank branches are so *2000s*. Online is where it’s at.

Demonetisation - Long Term Impact (after we are all dead) [P],17,5esf30,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5esf30/demonetisation_long_term_impact_after_we_are_all/,20,"In his speech on the demonetisation issue, Manmohan Singh, Ex-PM of India, quoted John Maynard Keynes’ clichéd *‘In the Long run, we are all dead’* to downplay the long-term positives of demonetisation exercise. 

However, one hopes, he would have instead focused on the long-term negatives of Demonetisation. 

The political leanings, short-termism have become so important in current times that the people sympathetic to BJP will not see anything negative in the move and people opposed to it would only look at the issues which can emote with the larger population like immediate suffering of people. Those opposed are only looking at short term negatives, which are transitory in nature, for quick karma and gains. 

In that light, we have all come to believe that demonetisation is good but implemented poorly. Even Manmohan Singh, indirectly accepted it. Unfortunately, he didn’t elaborate on his comment of calling it an organised loot and legal plunder.  

Manmohan Singh said that he is fine with the objectives but not with the implementation. However there is third angle to it, that of the *’Method’*.  Attacking black money is the Objective, Demonetisation is the Method and the exchange of notes, deposits and withdrawal are about Implementation. 

We have all come to a near consensus that implementation is a problem (I have different thoughts on it, but that is irrelevant to the topic I am discussing). We all agree that the growth and economy will suffer for the next quarters because of this. We also agree on certain positives like lower inflation (Demonetisation being deflationary), lower interest rates, possible increase in tax-base, a possible change in attitude and behavior of some businesses (as they start paying due taxes) and also Schadenfreude. 

However some of the long term benefits are overstated while some of the negatives are not being focused upon at all. 
We first though need to agree on what Demonetisation is ‘not’ intended to do, irrespective of the popular opinion and the statements by the Government. People use some of these points to wrongly attack Demonetisation, whereas the genuine reasons to criticize are being omitted. It will for example not decrease corruption (where Government itself is involved) although the current stock of corrupt money might get impacted. 

Now, the long term, the real long term, negatives (or shall we say possible risks), I foresee are:

**Gold and Dollar**- Despite the popular opinion that gold prices and gold consumption would be hit, I believe in the long term and the real long term Indians would buy even more Gold. We are already the biggest consumers and we will likely become even bigger. 

Human Psyche gets invariably impacted by events of prolonged stress which alters the behavior permanently. We start making choices subconsciously that we would not make otherwise. The years of controls/licences/shortages instilled that behavior in our previous generations and turned them into hoarders, stingy and untrustworthy of currency and vary of inflation. That promoted gold purchases and investment in real estate. They, at least those who can afford, would keep 3-4 months of expenses in cash whereas the current generation wouldn’t do it even for week’s worth of cash expenses. They would keep sub-optimally higher amounts in ‘saving accounts’ for contingencies and not invest it properly as future cashflows were always uncertain. An so on… 
What the demonetisation would likely do is to lower faith in Indian currency and leading the corrupt, tax-evaders and most importantly even the upright citizens to have some liquid assets in non-Rupee forms. That’s Gold and US Dollar. 

This would, longer term mean, higher current deficit and non-productive investments.  

**Cash/GDP ratio** - On of he stated target of Demonetisation is to lower the Cash/GDP ratio in India which at 12% is considered high.  Flushing our black money and promoting digital transactions are the steps in that direction. 
However, it might not only backfire but could possible increase the ratio in Long-term (as in 3-5 years out). If the restriction on the cash withdrawals continue beyond December or if some permanent policies are made to discourage or restrict cash withdrawals, it will encourage the people to have a bigger cash-stash at home for emergencies. Even if the moves restricting withdrawals aren’t permanent this behavior might become permanent. I do not keep much cash at home. However, the current problems added with some medium term policies, running into 2017, might lead to a sub-conscious change in my behavior leading me to keep 2-3 months worth of expenses in cash. My young daughter would likely also pick that habit up, unknowingly, making it a serious long term issue.  

The behavior change in the population, outside the sub-set of corrupt and tax-evaders might actually increase the long term cash/GDP ratio in India. 

**Currency**- The currency of a country is the best measure of its economic power. US Dollar is a reserve currency globally and everyone trusts it. When America sneezes, the world catches cold and the Dollar strengthens. That’s so counter-intuitive but reflects the might of the dollar. It also gives US free money to some extent adding to its prosperity. Only Japanese Yen and Euro are comparable, albeit distant cousins. Aussie Dollar, Canadian Dollar, GBP, Swiss Franc too have credibility. China has been trying to gain that credibility for RMB. They want it to become a reserve currency. They want their currency to give them power which some of the Western currencies enjoy and leverage. India is not at a stage to even attempt that. However 20 years out, it might be. Demonetisation though reduces the credibility of Rupee. The thinking would go like this, despite the best intentions- If India can do it once, it can do it again; if India could replace can it also confiscate; If there are risk let’s lower Rupee exposure. 

This one is real long term issue. However we might have pushed our ambitions of making Rupee acceptable globally by a decade or two with demonetisation.

**Trust**- The world functions on trust. A contract should be honored in all cases, even if the other party turns to be criminal in some other unrelated case. If I owe someone an amount, I will owe it to him, even if he kills his mother. The cash notes are a promise and a contract. Honest people will trust it, if the contract is honored even for dishonest, corrupt and criminals. This move would lower the trust in Indian currency for a very long time. It might get reflected in many ways ranging from gold-hoarding to diversification in other countries and markets. 

**Wealth transfer**- In a perverse way Demonetisation is turning out to be a wealth transfer from the corrupt and tax-evader to even more corrupt and opportunist. The agents, jewelers, bank employees and the people offering their time and accounts for conversion of old notes into new are the gainers at the expense of the previous set of corrupt. It looks unlikely that very large portion of old notes would stay out as most people will manage to convert it, as most economists have pointed out.  This would mean a failure of demonetisation in it’s primary objective. However there is likelihood that I might have misunderstood the objective. It might very well be to Tax the unaccounted wealth at higher rates of 60%-90%. The long term problems of this aspect aren’t clear to me but gut feel tells that this too would manifest itself in changed behavior of the populace.  ",ribiy," [deleted] Great write-up dude. Looks like you are into Behavioral Economics big time. Though, most of these looks like conjectures with lots of assumptions at the moment, you could be on the right track. Gold and real estate: will definitely see more black money being diverted here in future. Moving into dollars much tougher than gold and real estate. However, I do expect prices will fall significantly putting those who hold black money in form of real estate and gold adversely

Black money in the form of cash: people will stop doing it. So I would expect Indian currency mix to move to lower currency denominations from previously 85% in form of high denominations

Trust: supreme Court cancelled 2G and coal block allocations without compensation. Without compensation.

Currency: it is not feasible that we have a fake currency problem, black money problem and become reserve currency. Also, when US sneezes, it depends on what is causing the sneeze which determines movement of dollar. Political uncertainty in US, weaker dollar. Lower growth in US implies lower growth in other countries, hence flight to safety and stronger dollar in short term

 [QUOTE]Despite the popular opinion that gold prices and gold consumption would be hit, I believe in the long term and the real long term Indians would buy even more Gold. We are already the biggest consumers and we will likely become even bigger[UNQUOTE].

There are reports of a limit  being imposed soon on gold that can be held individually in households.

Wonder how it will pan out. Indians might be willing to wait and suffer but what about foreign investors? Future FDIs may demand relaxation in capital account convertibility which India cannot afford for quite a few years.  Quality post, thanks for taking the time to type all this out; I'm really interested in seeing more balanced commentary on the long term effects of demonetization; much of the media buzz is about what politicians like Kejriwal or Mamata say, and focus on almost exclusively the short-term hassle of ordinary people. Which is important of course, but still. All discussion getting hijacked by gut-feel, emotion, propaganda, nationalism and anger is just not useful at all. Much of social media is just schadenfreude from the white collar salaried TDS-taxpayer class, who are understandably upset but are seeing things almost exclusively from their own PoV. I have almost zero idea about economics, but reading all this is at least interesting.

I'm confused on the gold issue here - if people are spooked because of the risks of hoarding cash, they will naturally move to other places to park their money; like gold. But isn't that a bad thing for the economy ? And then why would popular opinion think gold would be hit ? Maybe they're talking about jewelry traders dealing in black ?

The Trust thing is huge, and that is definitely a major problem.

>Flushing our black money and promoting digital transactions are the steps in that direction. 

Moving towards a digital cashless economy is fantastic, the problem is though - is India really ready for it ? Such a huge % of India is illiterate to the point of simply being unable to ever use a debit/credit card. The country needs to do a lot more work to build the infrastructure for these things. We're trumpeting paytm-like services everywhere, but wireline and 3g connectivity which it depends on is still hopelessly unreliable in most parts of India.

>In a perverse way Demonetisation is turning out to be a wealth transfer from the corrupt and tax-evader to even more corrupt and opportunist. 

Yeah this is the worst fear of all, and you're quite right. It's sad how trying to eliminate cash hoarding has given rise to a massive hawala system already. Given the way mules are being used to deposit money into jan dhan accounts, the income dept would need to carry out scrutinies on crores and crores of accounts. For anyone familiar with how horribly sluggish (and corrupt) they are, this is an almost impossible task.

The thing with eliminating high denomination notes is that it's a good step in theory, but it needs to be backed up by many other systemic changes - printing 2000 rupee notes seems self defeating, especially without any added security features. High value real estate and jewelry transactions need to be monitored much more closely - there are just too many loopholes through which people get them with cash. These problems are going to endure.

Another really interesting source on demonetization's pros and cons is this blog post that I came across recently: 

https://ajayshahblog.blogspot.com/2016/11/trumping-black-money.html

And montek singh aluwaliah's interview with Karan Thapar: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T0HTD5D0JA

He talks in detail about how the huge informal sector of the Indian economy will suffer a huge impact because of this huge hit in their money supply, but also discusses the positives. The effect on agriculture and its supply chain is also really interesting. Fiat currency strength depends on 

* Resources and annual throughput of the country
* Consumption patterns of the country and its ability to sustain itself and its dependencies outside its borders
* Security and strength of the nation. which implies control a country's government can exert on its subjects, neighbors and other countries at large.

The above does not include people's perceived liberties, freedom and  entitlements of being a citizen of the country.

While the above statement is true, it has implication on how stable the government is based people's acceptance of its policies.So that is covered in #3.

Long term, we will all be dead : Lord Keynes.

Yes, because we could consume all resources worth and possibly that can be transformed and Lord Keynes did not have prior information on recycling. Other than the threat of global warming becoming true, recycling and sun rays should keep us going for sometime. Global warming is one threat that is under appreciated. 

Doom Sayers and Armageddon folks, please continue deciding on the next date.

On currency losing trust:

It is not about trust, it is about measurement. As long as people find it convenient to trade by marking a resource/service in a currency, currency stays. Soon, on this aspect, we may see rupee gaining in circulation across indian borders. 

Why? Neighbors now trust Indian government on strict vigilance on its currency.

Convenience trumps over trust anytime. If not sure, look around all the nations which work with each other despite trust deficit.

People in India who suggest that USD,EUR, gold are more dependable, it is important to note that finally taxation is what will force you to convert to INR. Reference : Alvin Toffler in his multiple books explains how currency is actually a state force benignly packaged. Read ""Debt"" another book which has an alternate take on money.

Any alternate currency, parallel government body promising welfare (NGOs), are a threat to a nation in long term. 

While people in randia are well heeled and can move out of this country, and can suggest to others as well. With the magnitude of population in India, it is minuscule and you are irrelevant. Heck, Amartya Sen has not been able to make a dent on this country in 30 years. While some points are good, the trust part is overdone. Currency notes have been changed for benefit of the currency itself. If anything, there is greater trust that GoI will not allow fucking around with the INR.",Policy/Economy,2016-11-25 15:31:09

    > The Gujarat government issued work order of **Rs 2,979 crore** to one of India’s largest engineering firm, Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T), on Monday to construct the Statue of Unity, the world’s tallest statue and one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet projects. The 182-metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is being built as a tribute to the “iron man of India” and to popularise his thoughts and ideology. The project was floated by Modi on October 31, 2013, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.

I am not sure if once you have signed a contract with a company (L&T in this case), you can have a say on their manufacturing processes. 
 Make in India, but not because you have been forced to, but make in india because it makes business sense to.

I'm sure you're looking to bash the govt for getting it made in china. I actually appreciate the objectivity of the state govt in taking such decisions, while I don't agree with it. Such decisions should make CAG-types happy too. How this project is funded? Lol. Statue of Patel being built by China. MakeInIndia is just a farce. Good find OP . Didn't Modi launched a campaign were every village was asked to donate iron which will be used to make the statue !! . ( http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Modi-asks-villages-to-donate-iron-for-Sardar-Patel-statue/articleshow/22614080.cms )

That was a jumla , didn't that intiative tell us how emotionally BJP sold the statute and the hypocrisy of now making in China  Height of hypocrisy! I don't want to live on this planet anymore!! > In Delhi, a 90-year-old ~~sculpture~~ **sculptor** Ram Sutar is giving final touch to model of Statue of Unity, based on which the actual statue will be built in China.  
  
Stuff like this makes me think that the work of the News folk of this website is really below par. Make in India is meant to be a scheme targeted towards the manufacture sector i.e basic assembly and labor in building products for domestic and international markets. There is no innovation involved in this scheme. The fact is India is still far from being self-sufficient and we still don't have the technology or skill required for building something as the Unity Statue. And your criticism of Make in India camping using this example is baseless. If it saves money for the state then it should be made in china, No sense in making in India if it costs more. So all this circlejerk is based on an unverified news piece. Good job randia...

[Also the project cost is 2979 crores while the statue costs 1347 crores]( http://m.timesofindia.com/city/ahmedabad/Statue-of-Unity-by-2018-Gujarat-government/articleshow/46468569.cms)

Mods can you mark this as unverified... [deleted]",Policy/Economy,2015-07-02 07:04:43
