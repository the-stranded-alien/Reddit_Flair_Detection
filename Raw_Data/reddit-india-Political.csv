"Non-Indian here, can someone give a TLDR of what the political landscape of India is like?",30,cr63nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cr63nx/nonindian_here_can_someone_give_a_tldr_of_what/,26,"Context: I'm a Malaysian, and Zakir Naik is currently in my country. Many people want him gone, but the only place our government can send him right now is back to India. I have heard people say sending him back to India would be a death sentence due to the religious tension he has caused, and I'm wondering whether that's true.",RadiantReddit," Are there a lot of people (in government and public) in Malaysia who want him gone?. Not a death sentence, but looking at his direct involvement in radicalization of youth he should be looking at a life sentence.
But also considering the current situation of judiciary, his case might take many years before actually reaching to a conclusion. He might live a normal life outside jail while having a couple or may be dozen of court hearings a year. I would deport him to Syria [deleted] Terror attack in Bangladesh (neighbouring country) on communal grounds

Zakir Naik “inspired” the terror attack

Fled the country.

Whatever happens to him depends on the Judiciary. Indian Judiciary is strong and independent of the government.

The Pakistani 2008 26/11 terrorist was also given legal representation and a fair civil trial in open court. Despite the public outcry, the Judiciary ensured a fair trial.

If Zakir Naik has broken any law in India, he would be punished by the Judiciary under said law. He will be arrested .. he will be put through Indian justice system ,.. it will take years before there will be any verdict... very likely he will get life sentence ...  

But he also has supporters in politics circles (votes matter) ... if party who rules central government changes   ... there is a possibility he might get away with some light punishment 

It’s fake propaganda that he will be killed... chances of that happening is very slim ... we have people who wants to break this country roaming* free... He is banned by many other countries too. That should tell you something. 
Get that mofo out of your country asap. he will not get death sentence because he didn't raped a minor and killed them after or directly caused a terrorist attack that cost life. max he will get is 20 years and most probably get out in 10. In a way its good for india you guys have him because it will cause massive riots in india if he will go to jail. We don't want him back, keep him as long as you like or if you don't want to then send him to your neighbouring Singapore. No way will he be killed in India. He'll definitely not be sentenced to death because that's for the rarest of the rare and the type of crimes he's been charged with like Money laundering and maybe some charges of inciting terror wouldn't get him that punishment. Still, I'd much rather you guys keep him because him coming here will only incite more hatred between Indian religious groups here as his case goes on so I'd rather he stays away. If he is sent to India chances of him being dead is very less. He will be tried in court and the max that is gonna happen is life in prison, Im even doubtful that he would get life in prison. His crime is not eligible for death sentence. Hopefully he gets imprisoned in some other country cus Indian Judicial system is way too slow",Political,2019-08-16 21:06:04
Increasingly polarized political opinions in indians. Is minority appeasement politics to blame here?,12,cp8xyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cp8xyy/increasingly_polarized_political_opinions_in/,34,"[Please remember this is my personal opinion. I am open for counter arguments and honestly hoping that I am wrong as I would like for things to be better]

Hi,
I've been wondering about this for some time. The Indian voter had become increasingly politically polarized in recent times. Many would attribute this to the rising right wing in the country. But I believe the rise of right wing in recent time is linked to rising resentment in the majority Hindu population with the invearse in minority appeasement politics in the other mainstream parties.

Democracy works best when parties campaign on generic issues on the forefront. This leads to voters voting for the party with the best manifesto. Voters are not loyal to one party and will vote for they opposition if the current ruling party messes up.

But what if one party starts providing benefits specifically to one Minority/ group? Humans are instinctively selfish creatures and tbh if a party promises something specific to me or my community, I would vote for them. Keep doing this and you generate a messaiah subject relation with the voters, and the respective community becomes faithful to your party. This might be enough to sway the total votes to your favour, given the majority is still divided.

With time, the public is increasingly divided and hostile to other parties as it is now either their party (with the specific benefits promised) or the others, which do nothing for you. 

This has carved up the voter base in India into distinct sections voting only for freebies or specific policies which only affect them, even at the expense of others.

Do you guys think this is an issue in current times? 

If yes how does politics go back to the way it was before? Why would a party running on appeasing a specific community give it up when this doesn't give them any benefits?

I believe the rise of the BJP can be related to this too. With regards to my relatives living in UP, they will now not vote for SP or BSP in any situation as this will only lead to development of ""other"" people and believe BJP is the only way to get their voice heard. Given that my relatives are conservative hindus, and with them being the majority, how will other parties ever win, given that they have lost the majority votes to a party doing minority appeasement, only this time, it is for the majority.",unvital_archduke," What minority appeasement you talking about? There was no minority appeasement (as Sachar committee report clearly showed) , and development is not a zero-sum game between groups. That minority appeasement leads to or has lead to majority impoverishment/extinction is a propaganda invention of hindutva not proved by any economic or census data. Since it was empty propaganda to start with, there is nothing to go back to. This is an opinion post. Kind of like a change my mind. I am not proposing new agendas, just looking for suggestions to fixing some of the issues related to increasing polarized political opinions Yes I think one of the major reason for the rise of BJP is hate for Congress and its Dynasty type ruling. Modi was elected as there was no one else to lead. 
The day we have anyone as good as modi, people will forget Modi and move on to the next one. Real-life in Karnataka:   When I was doing my BE. Normal peoples tuition fees with merit were 50k INR per year.

Sc/STs were around 25k INR.

(Christians its more than Sc/St I think not sure about this.)

Muslims its 0 INR.

This is not based on the economy of the family. Just religion.


We all wrote Entrance exam in Karnataka above fees is only who got seats in the merit-based system. But merit rank is not the same for everyone. even there Muslims/Sc/ST had reservations.

I don't what else you can call it other than minority appeasement.



Most of the temple comes under devasom board in Kerala. Temples cant use its own money from devotees as they want. it all goes to Govt. then govt. decides salaries of priest etc...

SO net flow of money from Hindu institutions is always negative(Temples I Know its more than 25% loss)

No such things for mosques or churches.


These things really hurt the sentiments of everyday local people. 

If you want secular country Govt, Should treat all religious institutions same, no extra provisions. Just like the US.

I personally think it is not bad if Govt is leaning towards Hindu(Since it is native to India, not an invasive ideology) institutions in India, cause most of ""Secular"" Europe leans towards Christianity. Not to mentions middle east. This is a global phenomenon now. It’s a backlash against way too much overt political correctness. > But what if one party starts providing benefits specifically to one Minority/ group?

> Humans are instinctively selfish creatures and tbh if a party promises something specific to me or my community, I would vote for them.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is–ought_problem No, it's mainly the incredibly efficient RSS/BJP propaganda machine that is responsible for the situation we see today. But that certainly was not possible by-itself, the opposition failed miserably and offered no resistance. The thing is, Right-wing populism is the easiest thing to sell. It appeals to passion and emotion which are major factors in building up support.",Political,2019-08-12 15:14:41

So, stay at home & listen to what the governor says.

:( It is so appalling how the Indian media has covered it. Most of the media (with the notable exceptions like The Wire, The Quint, Telegraph and The Hindu) has been acting like a state propaganda machine. I had never imagined that I would see anything like this happen in my country and to this extent. We really are living in a post-truth world. There is no war in Ba Sing Se. Great to have Kashmir news thread back again. Thanks to  [u/gujjuben](https://www.reddit.com/user/gujjuben/) for this. Things are far from normal. It will take some time and news about Kashmir is hard to get. Current situation of political leaders

Caged like the separatists meanwhile the separatists are roaming free

1.Will Kashmiri's protest till they get self-determination?.
2.Reinstating 370?
3.Protestors will start to get tired and just accept it?
4.Paksitan wages war?
5.India gets isolated in the world stage?

Anything else?. I am just brainstorming  questions so please don't mind stupid questions  lol

That being said. All of the apathy shown among the people and the media is very saddening, MHA lied about the BBC video, indian media has become some kind of propaganda(apart from the wire, the quint, the hindu and other news channels that report the ground situation). Can we have a NRC megathread on the sub too by the way? Or a combined Kashmir and NRC one?

The NRC is another human rights disaster waiting to happen. Thankfully, the final draft of the NRC released a couple of days ago didn't meet the expectations of the BJP so they themselves are protesting against it now. But I expect them to bring back the Citizen's Amendment Bill or something like that if they see prospects of losing elections over this. Innumerable people have already suffered and are continuing to suffer because of this ill-thought exercise in xenophobia. And, again, mainstream media is mostly ignoring it. It deserves the same attention as human rights violations in Kashmir. Pakistan's ICJ lawyer Khawar Qureshi admitted that his country doesn't have evidence to back their claims of genocide in Kashmir and therefore, cannot take the case to ICJ.  This is a complete u-turn from their earlier rhetoric to having significant evidences of human rights violation in Kashmir.

Basically Pakistan in a nutshell. If you think things in Indian Kashmir are bad, have a look at some of the things that have been going around in Pakistani Kashmir. 

One part of Kashmir (Gilgit-Baltistan) literally wants to break away from Kashmir and join Pakistan as a province. Infact, the people have never liked being a part of Kashmir because the entire region was unified with Kashmir when the British came by.

* [Tight controls on freedom of expression have been a hallmark of government policy in Azad Kashmir. Pakistan has prevented the creation of independent media in the territory through bureaucratic restrictions and coercion. Under Azad Kashmir's constitution, which Pakistan enforced in 1974, election candidates are “prescreened” to ensure that only those who support Kashmir's union with Pakistan can contest elections. Anyone who wants to take part in public life in Azad Kashmir has to sign a pledge of loyalty to Pakistan, while anyone who publicly supports or peacefully works for an independent Kashmir faces persecution.](https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/09/21/pakistan-free-kashmir-far-free)

* [After accession in 1948, the government declared Gilgit-Baltistan an agency of the central government, and deployed a political agent to administer its affairs through the Frontier Crimes Regulation — the notorious set of laws that allows collective punishments, outlaws political activity, and denies basic rights like appeal, wakeel and daleel (the right to appeal detention, the right to legal representation and the right to present reasoned evidence) in the tribal areas.](https://www.dawn.com/news/794958/from-the-fringes-gilgit-baltistanis-silently-observe-elections)

Is B.A in Political Science and Sociology and good choice or should I go for Public Administration instead of Sociology?,15,cvlq5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cvlq5r/is_ba_in_political_science_and_sociology_and_good/,10,I'm using the word good because I have interests in all 3 but can choose only two. Usually I see Political Science and Public Administration.,worriedpast," It really depends on what you want to do after graduation, or which subject you would enjoy studying more for the next few years.

I did Pol Sci. and Economics against Pol Sci and Statistics/Public Ad. My own understanding back then was that studying Economics will serve me better when I'm focusing on Political Science, especially the subjects that surround International Relations. And also because it would help me understand the subject in a better way for what I was aiming for.

Initially I thought I'd continue to do Masters but I scratched that idea away because none of the universities had any decent courses in Political Science/International Relations. I'd rather do self study for the sake of progressing the subject in my own way, and at my own pace. 

To be blunt, B.A. in India doesn't really have that scope of getting an ""A Grade salary"" right after you graduate. Of course, you could prepare for government exams like UPSC or SSC, then there's also the path of doing MBA or LLB.

If you intend to appear in government job exams then I would recommend Public Administration, it will be helpful when you're preparing for these exams. Sociology is also a decent choice, can't go wrong with it if you enjoy the subject.

So, take your time and think of what you want to do after you graduate, that way you can decide between the two. r/Indainacademia",Political,2019-08-26 17:31:48
IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan resigns over 'lack of freedom of expression’.,417,cuvhon,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ias-officer-kannan-gopinathan-resigns-over-lack-of-freedom-of-expression/article29244029.ece,77,,akki95," I don't know if I can share more information about this, 

But read about the resignation of the last FC of Indian Railways. He resigned just 3 months before his retirement. 


Guess the story I suspect some kind of misappropriation or other frivolous investigation will now be started against him by govt. No way the machine, esp. this machine, will tolerate such criticism from their own. My dad is also an IAS officer and I remember one time he and my dad were staying in the same circuit house, we went to another officer's room and the trio had a long discussion about Nehru, his vision for India, socialism, basically Indian political history. Whatever else may be true, I know for a fact that this guy is a genuine guy. He is not the bribe taking, power maximizing kind of IAS we see all too often. Given he is from Kerala, pretty sure he will be tagged as ""communist"" soon. Wake up, bhakts. You are just promoting a fascist. Bhakts in comment section : 

- Special status removal is right . This IAS officer is a leftist. He should just serve people and do what govt. asks. 

>>> He is not resigning because you took away special status of Kashmir. He is resigning because you are suppressing  voice of Kashmiris who have been impacted by this thing. 

- He lost his freedom of expression when he joined IAS. He is a govt. employee. He should just serve people.

>>> He is not resigning because his freedom of expression was lost. He is resigning because you have suppressed freedom of expression of people of Kashmir. You have arrested democratically elected members and infringing on their basic rights. 19 days since it happened and no improvement in their condition. 

My message to Bhakts - Sooner or later this will happen to a state that's not Kashmir. May be by BJP, Congress or some other government. This whole arrest thing and putting the state in curfew like situation is setting a horrifying precedence. It can happen anywhere and there will be a ready made excuse for that. Reddit is the only place that has not been taken over by the IT cell. Guys this is our space for freedom of expression. We  have to preserve this. The scale from the highest upvotes to the highest downvotes reflects the spectrum of comments ranging ranging from left wing to right wing... Meanwhile in other subs this scale would be reversed. Such freedom of expression, Much Wow /s I think we should have only one right in India. That'll be, ""Right To Opinion"". Fundamentally it will resolve most of our internal issues. IAS officers(Permanent executive) resignation has become common in our country owing to their subordination to the political executive( Politicians) since the time immemorial. Frequent transfers, suppression of freedom, stifling their voice, excessive interference by politicians into administrative matters, difference in the style of functioning between them pertaining to the policies and decisions are some of the factors responsible for their resignation in large numbers. He will start an IAS training academy now! So he got in trouble for doing relief work dressed civilian? Award wapsi like stuff, welcome to a bright political career. You can restore all their rights when you and like minded people like you get majority.

 Meanwhile, Indians in Kashmir will get their statehood sometime in near future. ( I do see the irony and depending on the people, it might take decades too ). I hope they come to terms with these new changes and be a part of rebuilding their state and contribute to the growth of the nation and their well being.

This is vindictive move. 

Rajiv Gandhi's assassination could have been avoided if his SPG cover was not removed by VP Singh government. And Ornob has a full-time Z cat security detail. Is kaka trying to shut him up? Mms had started increasing the frequency of his criticism of the current clown dispensation at the same time as chickens of fucked up economy and joblessness were coming home to roost. When you refuse to give tips on reviving economy even after multiple requests from prime sinister. He should claim that he is so well-liked personally that nobody's going to bump him. But the Amit and Mohan bhagwat *need* that z plus cover. > Plans for the move raised some eyebrows within the security establishment. **One official said that while the government was technically within the law to withdraw SPG protection to any former Prime Minister, it had chosen not to do so for Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who demitted office in 2004 and had SPG protection until he passed away in 2018.** A prolonged illness had kept Vajpayee home-bound for the past decade. **Dr. Singh is more “exposed” as he frequently travels. for political engagements and was just re-elected a member of the Rajya Sabha**, the official explained.

> A retired SPG officer said the SPG cover would only be reduced on the basis of threat levels as defined in the SPG Act of 1988. *“No govt. in power would take the risk of scaling down security without analysing the threat perception closely. No govt. would like to be discredited in taking a decision purely for political considerations,”* he said, citing former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, which brought much criticism to his successor V.P. Singh, whose government had withdrawn Mr. Gandhi’s SPG protection. Is the economy in such a bad condition ? There are people who like him, there are people who are disappointed in him and there are people who feel sorry for him. I doubt if anybody hates him, at least not enough to kill or hurt him. Army for a baba to damage a river. Nothing for a former PM. Vajpayee ,advani or even Murli manohar Joshi came among hit list of many organizations as they hosted trianga in Lalchowk and related to right nationalist group and rath yatra which is founding stone of our present politics......where as despite Manhoman is former pm he remaind low profile .
Based on conversation with security personnel of joshi as why he was given security despite being out of politics.
Not any personal vendetta by present govt everything is not conspiracy theory. If this isn’t simply pettiness from the part of the Modi government, then I’d say it’s a very nice and welcome move. Security arrangements are routinely reviewed by intelligence agencies based on threat perception but often get bogged down by political considerations. Vajpayee’s SPG security cover wasn’t removed even after he was bedridden purely because the Congress was gutless and knew the BJP would have made such a hue and cry about the perceived ‘insult’. 

In the case of Rajiv Gandhi, his entire security cover was withdrawn days before his assassination. Singh still has Z+ CRPF cover and since the SPG is primarily comprised of CRPF personnel, I’d say it makes much less of a difference. I’m sure the police and the security apparatus will be proactive with his protection. 

The current political climate is ripe to make structural changes like these. The Congress party no longer has the clout to fight it; and if there is anyone in Indian politics who does not actually care about security as a status symbol it’d be a technocrat like Dr. Singh.

Something is terribly wrong with the people.. I think it's the culture where you try to hide everything under the wraps and when those illiterate men see any women, cannot control themselves, that results in the consequent actions.. Do you guys think I am wrong.. Ah! 
This is so bad, our country is becoming the scum of the world. Wtf India Yup, this is hell alright. >""The girl, in her statement, said the acquaintance had called two of his friends, who raped her and threatened her with a countrymade pistol, against disclosing the incident to anyone. Later, she said that **more people gathered near the spot**. She asked **two other men passing by in a car to drop her home, but instead, they also raped her and left her on the outskirts of the village**,” 25 years for rape. 35 years for gang rape. Hang till death for rape and murder. 

Make a special rape case bench with a judge in all courts to fast track all cases.

Online comprehensive reporting and booking of rape case to police online (Using video, app etc) operated by women in Center office - so that local police can't do dog shit for taking cases. I really don't see how we're not the rape capital. No wonder most people around the world look disgracefully at India. This is the fact and there is no denying it. Now some of you might already be calling me anti-national, traitor etc.

Problem can be tackled only if you acknowledge it first. But people here are busy in blame game and victim shaming. 366A is ""Procuration of a minor girl"" not ""Procreation of a minor girl"". Every day the shame of sharing a country with these filth is overwhelming. I can understand politicians protecting businessmen and gangsters. 

But who is protecting these common rapists. Most of these are labourers and low income people. Why are they not prosecuted and given due justice. Need a party who wants to clear this problem once and for all. Wtf that headline :( It's high time the laws against rape should be revised impactfully in India. There should be a list of all these cases. Profiling of criminal  is a high time need.

Studies about literacy rates, age, occupation, marital status etc of the convicts would be of immense help. Why do incidents like this keep happening over and over again in the NCR? What the fucking fuck are these people? This is nerve-racking horror! Just be mindful of the fact that had the punishment for rape rivalled that of murder, They would not have just let her off with a threat after raping her. This is crazy. How can people be this inhumane?

We need to:

1. Sensetize youth and old people alike about respecting boundaries with respect to a child, a girl and a women. 

2. Have serious punishment for crimes like these.

3. Have a justice system impartial and speedy enough to close these cases the correct way.

Most importantly, we need fear of law and order that no one will go unpunished. Wherever you are girl , stay strong . All I can do for you is pray for you !! Respect for law and women is severely lacking in the Hindi belt. [removed] Sex education is the need of the hour. Not just in schools and colleges. Even in workplaces. And men and women should be taught in the same room, I've noticed how in most schools and colleges, the women and men are segregated during these classes and the men hoot and whistle like it's a jolly old time at a bar. I might get downvoted, but why is every heinous rape committed in Delhi or Delhi NCR? Or adjoining states? Crime prevention a job of police department and the people around is such a failure. 

Add to that the non existent swift or otherwise justice.

Add apathy towards each other and value of others life and we got the perfect receipe for this.

Which of these parameters are getting better ? None. Disgusting some people have no consciousness. Holy shit, what the fuck's going on there... Why the fuck this keeps happening in Delhi-NCR region?
What the fuck is wrong with people there? For just 3cr rupees, you too could enjoy all the perks living in Gurgaon Desh ki sanskruti aur parampara ka maan dekho! हम इस घटना की कड़ी निंदा करते हैं Bullying had already started here in western colleges. One student already suicided. We are sexually frustrated as a result of our regressive social practices. Time to admit this, at least. Normal day in India. As a man myself, somebody tell me how to change to a different species from men like those. A normal day in Rapeia. We truly are rotten Action should be taken to find the root cause/s of these incidents and deal with them but all that will get done are preventive measures because it's taboo in our society Seems like Gurgaon is a hell hole. How can people be so insensitive to others there? This is disgusting, north india is fucked up, it's not like rapes don't happen in other parts of india, but northern india has completely different scenario for women. Women in Mumbai can travel late in night, but I have heard about rapes in Mumbai too. Rape incidents these days feel like dejavu. What is the potential solution for this never ending issue of epidemic proportions.? Just another day in NCR. Ab to had hi hoti jaa rahi hai! 😢

There should be special courts in every districts Rape cases only, and punishment should be delivered asap and news should be published everywhere possible. 2 step solution to the sex crimes in this country

These politicians are just nostalgic about their past. Congress+JDS formed Govt to keep BJP out. BJP was desperate and was trying to make MLAs switch sides.

 They tapped into the MLA base who did not get ministries and got them to resign this time.

So numbers will favour BJP for Govt formation. Current Govt will fall by tomorrow. Mota Bhai is on a shopping spree There is an editorial piece about it in today's The Hindu. Give a read. These MLA's cannot defect to BJP because of the anti defection law, so they are resigning instead, this will eventually give BJP more seats allowing them to form the government. 

This type of horse trading is the worst and no other decent democracy would allow shit like this to happen. What a fucking joke. nothing to explain...it's the best example of worst politicians in India. Sad that we common citizens take elections so seriously to choose these idiots as our leaders..

Speaker being INC member decides to initiate disqualification against these MLA's without deciding on their resignations. MLA's who resign can contest bypolls and become ministers those who are disqualified cannot contest bypolls for the current session of the assembly.  So these MLA's want to join BJP and contest from BJP for the bypolls and speaker wants to fear them by disqualification to take back their resignations.

It's always been this way. Everybody has been spinning news items to present a narrative for their own benefit. 

> And worst of all , the fact that my criticism of the government can lead me to prison

Online abuse, govt orchestrated harassment, threat, may be detention/house arrest in extreme cases. Prison? Not so much, except some provocative/funny posts in social network often lead to arrest which is really shocking. Yes it is. Situation is the same all over the world.There has been a concerted push all over the world to increase tribalism in the name of Nationalism and increasing vitriolic output on the social media over debate.There has been a major effort by vested parties to push a narrative that fits their agenda and the best way to avoid criticism and to be called out against it is to stifle any view counter productive to them.

The game plan is Keep them dumb and stifle opposing voices. You are not the only person with these dilemmas and doubts. I have spoken to a lot of people back home that includes members of my extended family, friends and ex-colleagues. There are primarily two types of people:

* Those who do not care about what is happening around them. They keep their eyes set on only what they need and what is important to them and their family. They do not have an interest in the economy and politics. They do not seem to have any problem. They are in fact happy and under the impression that things are getting better because:
   * India is getting stronger every day and will eventually teach Pakistan a lesson
   * Hindus are now dominating
   * All the immigrants will be soon deported
   * India is sending spacecraft to the moon and mars
   * Narendra Modi is a superman

These are the unthinking type of people. They like to go about their business, count their money, go shopping with their spouses, talk about mobile prices and latest gadgets. They are devoid of critical thinking. They like to follow. They just need a leader. They will follow anyone who appears to be strong and can make promises of prosperity.

* But there is another section of society and they are scared witless. These are the people who have taken active participation in politics and have some knowledge about the country and the world. Some want to leave India. Some want to send their kids abroad. They do not know what may possibly happen to them. They know that it is not the government or the agency but they themselves are their enemies. They know that they cannot sit quietly for long and if they speak up they might end up in police custody. They have said that the political environment is toxic. Those who are even more depressed are saying that democracy has ended in India. With the economy plummeting, the government will become severe on critics and will continue to distract the people with bigger spectacles. Yesterday it was Balakot. Today it is the abrogation of 370. Tomorrow it might be something even bigger, with even more far-reaching consequences. Most comments are asking him to move out. You can see the thick brains of these people which are indirectly proving OP right about his fears. With you, OP. I blame a lot of this on social media and the rest on people's stupidity. They have zero critical thinking abilities and eat all the propaganda spewed by the government.
I don't know what's going to happen next, I've stopped arguing about this shit with people because they just don't seem to get it and terme as being biased because of religion. (I come from a Muslim family, am an atheist though).
And this shit is honestly from decently (academically) educated folks, who are so comfortable in their privilege and dogma that reason doesn't get to them.
(Note: I mention only academically, because I truly don't think you've any education whatsoever if you don't have the ability to think critically and form options based on facts). > Can't trust a single news source, facts are a thing of the past

However, here is how I like to look at it. The silent minority of intellectuals will eventually grow (unless there is a fascist regime ready to take over which is highly unlikely given that it's such a diverse demography). As people become more educated, facades come down and critical thinking grows (and history has been the proof of this trend) , this idiocracy would eventually calm down.

For near future, yes we need to be a little cautious. There are elements backed by pure hatred and lust for power. But then idealism has always toppled the worst dictators. So I will continue to place my faith in that very same idealism. 

And I am not moving out of my country because someone feels that they have a greater right over it. They don't! This country is as much mine and yours as it is theirs. And we shall keep our claims strong always. Do you try to understand the other POV? How tolerant is the current youth? I find today's youth more intolerant of ideological differences than in the past. Emigration is \#1 solution to all problems atleast over here. Shit seems to be spiralling downwards all over the world... World hunger and absolute poverty levels had been consistently going down every year, until 2016 I think. Since then they've been increasing every year, climate change has been proposed as the culprit. Sry can't produce sauce, too lazy rn Keep calm and NIN on This type of things mostly happen on social media platforms. 
You can have normal discussion with your friends and coworkers. I agree 101% with everything OP said. I feel the same way. Where is my country going and why can't I do much to contribute to something positive. The bias and issues you mentioned has always been there at some level. You are just more aware of it now. I'm a Canadian so I may not offer a amazing position but I'll use what I know. Pretty much you cant trust any media source at all regardless if where you are. They'll be biased whatsoever even if the government or officials aren't handing money over. Media will lean in one and only one direction to continue the narrative. I find especially in the west offering opposite opinions is very dangerous in the sense in how most people are thinking in only one way. And over here if you are intolerant your job is likely at stake. Sounds crazy but it's true. I understand what you mean by how people refuse to listen or allow even discussion of any sort. It feels like the country is only allowed to go one way. As for what facts I know I mean in Canada we dont get a ton of coverage of Indian politics (outside of the kashmir disputes) however during my time I was there a few weeks ago and the prospective of my family and their friends on moodi and his government is leaning on the side of very traditional outdated polices and also he has such control over media that he has forced out the Gandhi family from being a figurehead. He sounds like he is a very controversial leader. I find with the way he has handled certain situations he hasn't been levelheaded and unable to calm this persona of his. Tbh he seems like a total douche in real life but oh well he does differ from Trudeau (who is arguably the worst leader in Canadian history) in how he is very India first. Question is is that helping India I'm not sure. TLDR; Polarisation. You can trust The Hindu and Indian express.
You're not that special for government to care about you so don't worry. No one has any ideas left. The BJP came to the fore as being different. Now they've run out of ideas and it's only about continued control even as they extract their rent for the next 10 years or so. I mean I saw the FM asking Bank execs for ideas for the Indian economy.Like WTF?! 

In summation; Will Indian problems be solved? Nope. Will more shady people exert all sorts of social control? Yes. Can dissent survive and be debated? Nope. Can you be sensible? Unlikely. Is it likely to get worse? Very likely.

Not as harsh as the title makes it sound. Basically same house arrest as before but in a different and bigger house. You mean house arrest right? [removed] I am failing to understand this move. Why was this necessary if they were already under house arrest. Indian government has been heavy handed in their approach, but 72 years is a long time. Yeah... this is going to get ugly. Hello fascism my old friend Wow. Ex CMs of the state are arrested. Every possible political voice will be detained. the agreement of legislative assembly is the bare minimum that people of Kashmir deserved before such a huge decision relevant to them. Now we have just ripped them off any political power. We have bulldozed one of our own people. How is that democratic. It doesn't matter that the centre has a majority. This is a matter related to a state. By any common sensical definition of democracy, this is unconstitutional. But here we are cheering the fall of our own constitution. All those cheering for this, please think how will it feel if tomorrow your state was bifurcated without taking into consultation any of your elected representatives. I guess most of us do not understand the civics 101 to care for such technicalities. What do we care about such abstract things like democracy and political voice when we don't even care about tangible things like economy and the state of our flooded cities..But hey, we have a dear leader who has finally showed them who's the daddy. So that must be good. It's ok that constitutionalities and will of the people have been circumvented. Afterall we need to get things done and not let such flimsy notions come in way of progress. So as long as something bold is done it's ok that democracy is taken away piecemeal. It was probably too good a concept for our people anyway. So, We will cheer along while we are being fucked! The day democracy died in Kashmir. No matter how you feel about the Kashmir issue this was done undemocratically and should be opposed. Let's just arrest anyone that might not agree with our laws with out breaking any laws whatsoever. This is fascism. I was wondering 

Is this the norm for all crimes ? For example  if drugs are legal in a country especially harmful ones but later the law gets changed and drugs become illegal 

Will the person who was on drugs before the law changed be arrested ? I'm curious It's funny how arrest is different to us and the rich. Modi and his wife Amit Shah have turned India into China. Fascism

Sad it is, but an eye opener too. Future looking bleak for our beloved democracy Can someone eli5 it for me?
Context. Easy money with no need to answer. 

Ache din and the irony of Modi i miss democracy..or atleast the illusion or hope of it. Such a shameful move by the government. And what's even more shameful is that this will be happily accepted by the majority of the people because of the propaganda machine which runs all the time in the form of news channels. Pussy move by Govt If you look at the history of the RTI Act - it was actually Kejriwal (even before he became a politician) who had protested long and hard to get it passed. I believe he was awarded the Magsayay for the same.   

On one side we have someone like him - who people only laugh at.   
On the other side, we have the ""vikas purush"" who has only played politics after taking the office - but people still worship him. I don't know what is wrong with our country. but why he looks like granny of courage the cowardly dog But but Aajtak said hindu khatre me hai?!!! This gives "" House Of Cards "" feels. Most of the Indians poverty stricken people and rural, people who lack information, are brainwashed by these politicians and hence they truly believe in 'achhe din'.... Afterall why such an amendment to the Act is needed?? those who catch the turtles must eat them, those who vote them to power must suffer them (along with those who didnt vote for them :( ) This amendment is absurd. Although I understand that the salary of officers of a statutory body shouldn't be equal to elections comminsion but this will sure make them puppets of the centew Is it weird that even democracy is feeling smothering now.
All hope is gone. I wouldn't be surprised if this govt. disbanded elections all together. This is the end of democracy. Time to migrate We have to seriously do somethings.This is preposterous. This is what happens when democracy turns into mobocarcy the tyranny of majority. I remember how Hannah arenndt prescribed the most important actions of humans as political action.

I feel somehow that all the drama of arresting him and making him into a hero by those speeches is classic co-opting by New Delhi. They're making him into a hero for the public there and hoping that the street cred he gets will translate into votes for him in the upcoming UT elections (whenever they are). It's eerily reminiscent of the British Indian Govt's attitude of building up the Congress (and specifically Gandhi) by engaging with them. jailing their leaders but not kala pani types, making deals with them etc. The most famous eg is that of Lord Irwin dealing with Gandhi one on one to settle the CDM which instantly made Gandhi extremely powerful much to the chagrin of pro British elements in India. It was still smart on the part of the Brits in hindsight. Maybe? They definitely have to.

If I were in my 20s, pumped up with Nationalism on steroids then I would have said ""we'd bring change""  


Now I've realized that our System is built on an Uneducated, Morally corrupt Society and it'd be naive to think we can change the system without changing the underlying society. Fuck this country. and when I say Fuck this country in front of someone, I usually get a reply which tells me to thank the old gods and the new that this country isn't Pakistan as if it's a complement towards a land where one slap to a cow can make you evaporate from the face of this planet. We need to remove unfit policeman from their job. Why is our police force so inept? News like this makes me so angry. We need a huge reform in how our police force functions When i was young i saw the movie Anniyan. I was really split back then because i never thought vigilante action was the way forward. But in a lawless fucked up country like India, we need vigilantism is how i feel now. 

90% of machinery is corrupt and/ or inept. and the balance 10% is punished for any action they might take. 

Who is making these fuckers, who are supposed by the protectors and enforcers of law and justice accountable. they are there to serve and protect and act like fucking kings. Really really pissed off right now. 

But at least the PM of this country is gonna be headlining a popular TV show on an international channel. Great right? Fuck this country, fuck the police, fuck these MLAs and politician and fuck the people who elect them > According to government data, the number of crimes against women reported to police in India rose by 83 per cent from 2007 to 2016. Four rape complaints were reported every hour in 2016, the data showed.

> The conviction rate for crimes against women in India is very low – only 18.9 per cent and the lowest in a decade – according to the latest official crime statistics from 2016. 

More rapes being committed and yet lesser rapists are convicted. No wonder India is the most unsafe country in the world for women. We can guess what's gonna happen, the government will show their crocodile tears and call for stricter laws for rape. To hell with actually enforcing even the existing ones. This country has no future now if these things keep going

->casteism, communalism,regionalism and language conflicts

->child abuse,child labour and violence against women

->alcoholism, drug abuse and corruption

->lliteracy,proverty, unemployment and population growth

Now our beloved politicians are already Investing their power in all type of crime, misinformation to control the people.so there is no hope from them

But as a society member we failed because we choose these asshole to rule on us.even I can't blame these politicians because we choose to ignore and doing shit things to our fellow people,

Example: if a politician talk against anything like ""bihari"" migration are the reason of overcrowding in Mumbai then ""we"" started beating ""bihari"".
A politician said ""north indian"" imposing hindi to us then what we did l, we started ""hating"" to each other.

Look politicians talk shitty thing but in general we as a normal people do their shitty things.

Bottom line is that ""we are bad people"" in society.only uniform changes.
You like it or not but this the truth.
But there are always exception. This is how parts of India keeps the rape statistics much lower than actual.

Shame. [deleted]  An Allahabad High Court judge, Justice A.N. Mulla said in a judgment in 1960 or so "" I say it with all sense of responsibility that there is not a single lawless group in the whole country whose record of crime is anywhere near the record of that organized unit which is known as the Indian Police Force."" ( see [https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1498181/](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1498181/) ) The way police treat the common people in India is fucking scary and disgusting. It's not even easy to talk to these cunts, they talk to you as if you are the criminal. And when real local criminals talk to them, their voice comes down and they talk to them like pussies. That's the pathetic state of India. Fuck this country. Why do I feel no matter how many threads are made for discussion, strict laws are put in place, however many protests are done, dharna varna etc... no matter however many movies are put out, that small amount of people who have no conscience whatsoever will turn a blind eye to such things and just proceed to rape at their whim. And after that the people who are supposed to protect us are doing dogshit (I'm not generalizing, just for such cases). I don't even want to think about this anymore after that unnao case, disgusting..... We seriously need huge political reform in this country. We need a progressive young leader who's going to turn this country around. Yet we won't. Nothing's gonna change. The uneducated idiots on Twitter will still preach Modi, thinking he gives two shits about them. God, I'm afraid this country is never really gonna change. So much for the biggest democracy. Moral component is missing This is of course reprehensible, but not unexpected.

But as an aside, with a string of news articles like this coming out in the Western and local media, I don't envy Indians who have to deal with foreigners regularly. The reputational damage to brand India cannot be easily undone. 

Negative stereotypes tend to reinforce themselves. You can have 100 positive news coming out of the country (ISRO, reduction poverty etc.), but it's the rape stories that stick and contribute to how you're seen. Make a million laws but u can't change people's mind :'( This bunch of people called the Indian Police are the most useless people on the planet. They have more interested to take care of Azam Khan's buffaloes than serving the people. How many times will things like these happen?When will we see justice before its too late? The police in India is simply incompetent,stupid and overrun by corruption, but here if they really did arrest and charged the guy over someone alleging to have been raped 4 years ago with probably little to no evidence, it'd have the same reaction as now.",Political,2019-07-30 13:14:25
Rahul Gandhi resigns as President of Congress,1131,c8lydy,https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/i-am-no-longer-congress-president-affirms-rahul-gandhi20190703143743/,409,,GA3RU," This just might be the best thing to happen to Congress off late. And to Rahul Gandhi too. About time! No matter one's views, India deserves a strong  opposition. 

I'm not sure who should succeed him, but it should be a non-Gandhi who has done good work in their state and is preferably younger. Someone like Sachin Pilot? Here's the full resignation letter from Rahul Gandhi. 


>It is an honour for me to serve the Congress Party, whose values and ideals have served as the lifeblood of our beautiful nation. I owe the country and my organisation a debt of tremendous gratitude and love.

>As President of the Congress Party, I am responsible for the loss of the 2019 election. Accountability is critical for the future growth of our party. It is for this reason that I have resigned as Congress President.

>Rebuilding the party requires hard decisions and numerous people will have to be made accountable for the failure of 2019. It would be unjust to hold others accountable but ignore my own responsibility as President of the party.

>Many of my colleagues suggested that I nominate the next Congress President. While it is important for someone new to lead our party, it would not be correct for me to select that person. Ours is a party with a profound history and heritage, one of struggle and dignity that I deeply respect. It is woven into the fabric of India and I trust the party will make the best decision regarding who can lead us with courage, love and fidelity.

>Immediately after resigning, I suggested to my colleagues in the Congress Working Committee that the way forward would be to entrust a group of people with the task of beginning the search for a new President. I have empowered them to do so and committed my full support to this process and a smooth transition.

>My fight has never been a simple battle for political power. I have no hatred or anger towards the BJP but every living cell in my body instinctively resists their idea of India. This resistance arises because my being is permeated with an Indian idea that is and has always been in direct conflict with theirs. This is not a new battle; it has been waged on our soil for thousands of years. Where they see differences, I see similarity. Where they see hatred, I see love. What they fear, I embrace.

>This compassionate idea permeates the hearts of millions and millions of my beloved fellow citizens. It is this idea of India that we will now vehemently defend.

>The attack on our country and our cherished Constitution that is taking place is designed to destroy the fabric of our nation. In no way, shape or form am I stepping back from this fight. I am a loyal soldier of the Congress party and a devoted son of India and will continue to serve and protect her till my last breath.


>We fought a strong and dignified election. Our campaign was one of brotherhood, tolerance and respect for all of India’s people, religions and communities. I personally fought the Prime Minister, the RSS and the institutions they have captured with all my being. I fought because I love India. And I fought to defend the ideals India was built upon. At times, stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it. I have learned so much from the spirit and dedication of our workers and party members, men and women who have taught me about love and decency.

>A free and fair election requires the neutrality of a country’s institutions; an election cannot be fair without arbiters – a free press, an independent judiciary, and a transparent election commission that is objective and neutral. Nor can an election be free if one party has a complete monopoly on financial resources.

>We didn’t fight a political party in the 2019 election. Rather, we fought the entire machinery of the Indian state, every institution of which was marshalled against the opposition. It is now crystal clear that our once cherished institutional neutrality no longer exists in India.

>The stated objectives of the RSS, the capture of our country’s institutional structure, is now complete. Our democracy has been fundamentally weakened. There is a real danger that from now on, elections will go from being a determinant of India’s future to a mere ritual.

>This capture of power will result in unimaginable levels of violence and pain for India. Farmers, unemployed youngsters, women, tribals, Dalits and minorities are going to suffer the most. The impact on our economy and nation’s reputation will be devastating. The Prime Minister’s win does not negate the breadth of corruption allegations against him; no amount of money and propaganda can ever hide the light of the truth.

>The Indian nation must unite to reclaim and resuscitate our institutions. The instrument of this resuscitation will be the Congress party.

>To achieve this important task, the Congress Party must radically transform itself. Today the BJP is systematically crushing the voice of the Indian people. It is the duty of the Congress Party to defend these voices. India has never and will never be one voice. It is and always will be a symphony of voices. That is the true essence of Bharat Mata.


>Thank you to the thousands of Indians, both at home and abroad, who have sent me letters and messages of support. I will, of course, continue to fight for the ideals of the Congress Party with all my strength. I am available to the party whenever they require my services, input or advice. To those who support the Congress ideology, especially our dedicated and beloved karyakarta, I have absolute faith in our future and the utmost love for you. It is a habit in India that the powerful cling to power, no one sacrifices power. But we will not defeat our opponents without sacrificing the desire for power and fighting a deeper ideological battle. I was born a Congressman, this party has always been with me and is my life’s blood and forever that way it shall remain.

>Jai Hind. Lol. Party members are actually asking him to stay. ""After ages, I am free!"" Dibs on the seat. Have not been following Indian news much since the elections. Who could the next leader of the INC be? If he had done this before, they could have diluted the dynasty tag, at least in the literal sense. But Modi vs WHO? WHO ?

I guess we will all just ignore that Rahul setup that Congress data cell that basically fed them a bunch of bogus data and information which led to this poll debacle. BJP's 🌟 campanier is out. The power of marketing and pr can do, to finish off a guy forever. Seems like he is just fed up of politics , good  for him to resign. It will be interesting to see how congress will cope with the loss. No matter what people say i have utmost respect for Rahul Gandhi.....he never used crass words and never spew filth at other people and maintained his dignity throughout but alas that's just not indian politics i hope you best in life ahead. Huge loss to BJP! Time to appoint a puppet and pull the strings from behind without any accountability. Comes After 2months actually when he said he will.  Why So much of tantrum - could have been easily done. Not for long. He will courageously, efficiently and magnanimously return to save the party.

>Sonia Gandhi resisted all the pressure from ""the loyalist"" Congressmen to join the party. The Rao government was voted out in 1996. Sonia Gandhi did not campaign in the election. The BJP won 161 seats and the Congress got 140.

>Suddenly in the winters of 1997, Sonia Gandhi announced that she would campaign for the Congress party in Lok Sabha election due for March 1998. Sitaram Kesri was the Congress president at the time.

>The change in leadership equation in the Congress was swift.

>Sonia Gandhi joined the party in December 1997 at its plenary session in then Calcutta. She addressed her first election rally in Tamil Nadu, the state where Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated.

>In January, Sitaram Kesri welcomed the decision by Sonia Gandhi to join the Congress and campaign for the party in an interview with India Today.

>Sitaram Kesri said, [""Sonia has come as a savior.""](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/interview/story/19980119-sonia-gandhi-has-come-as-a-saviour-sitaram-kesri-828188-1998-01-19) By that time it was clear that the Congress could only function under Sonia Gandhi. Demands were being made in the Congress party asking Sitaram Kesri to hand over the reins of the party to Sonia Gandhi.

>But Sitaram Kesri, then 82, wanted to hold on for some time. He had some support in the party but the ""rebel camp"" was in majority. The Congress Working Committee passed a resolution on March 14, 1998 asking Sitaram Kesri to step down as party president.

>The transfer of power in the Congress is often termed as the bloodless coup. It was dramatic and executed by the use of force.

>Sitaram Kesri was reportedly locked in a room in the Congress headquarters on the Akbar Road in New Delhi to prevent him from creating obstacles in Sonia Gandhi entering the office of the Congress president.

>With Sitaram Kesri locked, Sonia Gandhi entered the Congress headquarters triumphant with her supporters shouting slogans.` lol. good riddance. honestly. BJP supporters (crying): Amul Baby, please don't leave. How will we win without you? :D

Seriously, Rahul and Sonia should now quit politics and leave. This is a golden opportunity for Congress to kick nepotism and dynasty politics out. If a proper new President is elected then maybe they can give the party credibility. If they elect a Gandhi-controlled robot, then the party will just sink further. This guy finally realised that politics is not his cup of tea. I don't hate him on a personal level, as he seems to be a nice person, but he is/was an absolute disaster as Congress President. Go and live a peaceful life, away from incessant hatred and bigotry. This is a land of wolves now. Permanent thailand citizen incoming India needs a reddit party. The strongest opposition!

Best thing to happen to Rahul, Congress and also India cause you need a strong opposition. A one sided government isn't good for India. A fresh face will light the fire under BJP's ass and keep them on their toes. Finally He was never committed to it bye-bye congress, vultures are their way.

What would you expect from this party when their party leader CBN said ""Who would wish to be born a schedule caste"" and dalits had to file a complaint against him.

[None want to be born Scheduled Caste, says Chandrababu Naidu](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/100216/none-wants-to-be-born-scheduled-caste-says-chandrababu-naidu.html) Some Kamma caste members consider themselves Royal blood , even Chandra babu's brother in law said that publicly .  So a dalit MLA who isn't subservient to them is blasphemy to them If a MLA of the ruling party has to go through this. Imagine what ordinary dalits have to go through.

Jokes aside, government service will no longer be a guarantee of stability. Shit employees can and will be fired for reasons including but not limited to corruption, abuse of authority, poor performance, etc. Would also get rid of or curtail UPSC. Make different departments get people qualified for the job instead of idiots who know nothing of the subject matter but were assigned because they passed a one size fits all exam. All stupid statue/temple/memorial projects will be scrapped.

Teaching will be made a noble profession which pays well and attracts passionate candidates

i would understand that religion would be a very useful tool to manipulate the masses by igniting fear and hatred. i will use it whenever it suits me.

 
the parliament would be still functioning for name sake. all bills will be passed without much discussion. the media will praise it as the most functioning and speedy parliament in the history of the country.i will still allow RTI in the country but full powers to appoint the officers will be vested with me.   

in short my dictatorship will be entirely different from now, not at all similar to the wonderful democracy we have today. * Get all political leaders to fight to the death on national TV then execute the winners on the season finale.

* Fast-track courts and justice procedures. 

* No religious bullshit tolerated. 

* Focus on science and economy. 

* No racism, castism, or any kind of discrimination would be tolerated.

* Focus on fighting climate change. 

* The pay of higher executives would be regulated.

* Mandatory 1 year service in the Indian Armed Forces for everyone once they turn 18. Pogroms obviously , for all people judging people by their surname Read and fully implement the Rules for Rulers .. https://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs National water network. Let the water from Ganga and Brahmputra flow into the dry regions (via canals) such as Vidarbha, North Karnataka and other plateau regions for agriculture and what not. People will need to pass basic common sense and general knowledge tests to be able to get on the Internet. ban elections I will enact these changes through my dictatorship and then give the power back to the people:

* Every politician in the country and members of political parties will be issued a card, call it PolCard, that identifies their status as a political actor in the country. Anyone new wanting to run in an election or join a political party must first register as a politician and get their PolCard. No person without the card can run for office or be a member of any political party. 

* By registering as a politician, you give away your right to privacy in terms of banking and finances. All your personal and professional accounts will be linked to your PolCard, and all your transaction history will be visible to anyone upon request. Holding any secretive or undisclosed accounts will result in the cancellation of your PolCard and your status as a politician in the country, meaning you can no longer run for elections or be a member of any political party ever.

* Every political party in the country must also disclose all their banking and finances. All their transaction history will be made visible to anyone upon request. Holding secretive or undisclosed accounts will lead to the banning of the party from participating in the current election cycle (local or central), meaning no members from the party can run for office under the party's name; they may run as independents or as members of a different political party. 

* Every civil servant in the country, except for judges, from postman, peons to police officers, will become part of a database with a rating system, in which every Indian citizen can rate any individual civil servant they may encounter in their day to day lives. The rating system will be multifaceted, for example one can rate down, say, a staff at the passport office for being rude or inefficient. Those who have unsatisfactory ratings will be subjected to review or sacking by the appropriate authority. This will be implemented essentially as a app, where an Indian citizen can use their Aadhar identification to get access to the database, search for a civil servant and rate them. It will be possible for someone to rate a civil servant low by mentioning bribery as the primary reason. 

* Every Indian citizen will be given a new duty, which is as follows: once a year at random you will get a letter from the anti-corruption commission, which will specify you a task where you will be required to go to a government office and report on the state of bribery/corruption in the office. For example, you may receive a letter telling you to go to a specific police station in your area and make a complaint - the details of all this will be given in the letter. You are then to report on the state of corruption in the police station. Along with the letter, you will receive a survey sheet, in which you are to make your report and post it back. If you find someone taking bribery, you can make an accusation in the report, and the anti-corruption commission will take action. A particular government office, be it police station, post office, RTO etc., that gets a lot of bad reports/bribery accusation will be ripped to pieces by the anti-corruption commission.

I will make all these changes constitutional, i.e., I will make these changes and the principle behind them a part of the constitution. * Implement Uniform Civil Code 
* Implement Western secularism (separation of the state and religion) 
* Mandatory 10-12 years of elementary education for children 
* Invest heavily in quality education and impart an education that develops scientific temper

* Execute all politicians over night for corruption
* Form a one party rule with no other political party or ideologies in existence
* Train the army and build a black ops police force to curb any aggression against the party, a patriotic army is what keeps a dictatorship alive
* Spend on media to encourage people to be on the offensive against anyone who does not agree with the parties values and making them believe that they are actively working against the nation's interests
* The Focus of the party will be on 5 things - Economy, Education, Environment, Infrastructure & Law  
**---Economy--**
* Govt expenditure will be controlled heavily (I know investment is needed in the short term) but for the long term, there will be massive disinvestment in PSUs
* Banks, BSNL & MTNL and other non profitable govt units will be sold off to stop the massive cash drainage
* Reduce foreign aid to a minimum, take all the aid you can and stop imports of all agricultural produce
* Get Farmers to grow all kinds of crops and provide them with technical know how and allow them to sell directly to the consumers by abolishing APMC to cover for the reduction in imports, cutting off the middlemen will drastically improve the situation of the farmers (currently a farmers sells a kilo of produce for as little as Rs. 2 which is bought by the consumers at Rs. 20)
* Abolish several Pradhan Mantri XYZ Scheme thats basically a free handout to the people
* The reduction in govt expenditure will allow the govt to reduce tax rates encouraging the private sector to invest more
* Govt will follow through the sovereign bonds and raise the foreign debt to 15% of GDP (from current below 5%) and invest in infrastructure  
**--Education--**
* The entire nation will follow the same pattern - no local universities with everyone offering different things
* Change the entire syllabus, the children will learn 3 languages - English, Hindi and the local state language across the country
* The local language and hindi will only be till the 7th grade
* Children will be taught how to code
* The stories behind how something was developed will be shared and not just the end result, so the students don't just mug things up and understand the importance of things they learn and their practical application
* When i was in 8th grade, we used to have standard deductions in essays, byheart ""muhavra"" in hindi and marathi and basically spit all of it out on the exam paper - all of this will cease to exist
* Teaching will become a noble passion - their qualification will be tougher and they will be paid handsomely
* Current HRD minister will be fired  
**--Environment--**  
* Firecrackers will be banned completely
* Rain water harvesting will be encouraged throughout the country
* Holi will be dry
* Rivers will be cleaned so that oceans are no longer being polluted / Get a few snipers to roam the banks with license to kill
* Plastic will be banned in almost all cases
* FMCG Goods packaging will be reduced; See : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcnAYdrV074

* Indore's garbage disposable mechanism will be taken on a national level; See : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MS8vfcTmSM  
**--Infrastructure--**  
* All the money govt saved in on the disinvestment will be used to fund the infrastructure projects  
* Railways will be electrified, unprofitable rail lines shut down and increase fines for those that travel with tickets upto 10,000 and increase monitoring by TCs
* As someone who travels via train in extreme crowds, First Class compartments and Disabled compartments will be removed in favor of normal compartments, Trains will have 15 coaches and to accomodate that platforms will be longer
* Newly made roads affected by potholes will result in death of contractors  
**--Law--**
* Greater focus on gender neutrality - all laws will be gender neutral and applicable to both genders with same punishments
* Men usually receive greater punishments for similar crimes - a team will be setup to examine punishments given by judges and discard biased judges
* Prenups will be mandatory in all marriages - Divorce will no longer be a get rich instantly card
* Judges will no longer be appointed on basis of years of experience and will be done so on basis of merit
* More courts to fast forward the amount of cases pending (There are about 1 crore cases pending in all the courts in India)
* Steps will be taken to ensure anyone who falls a victim to a crime today gets justice tomorrow and not 10 years later The first thing I would do is increase our awareness about “dignity of labour” Death penalty for littering Public executions motherfuckers.

Radical reform in police & judiciary Dictators are considered as bad guys in our time. So, I'll become the chairman of the Election and Executive Commission of India (EECI). There will be a prime minister and a cabinet too along with all the bags and baggages of democracy like Parliament and political parties etc.

Every decision taken by the Parliament, cabinet or the PM must be send to the EECI for approval before becoming a law or a government order. Every advice coming from the EECI should be followed by the government.

Every election will be done via EVM and all elections will be held in a single day and fully controlled by EECI. So, it will be easier to manage.

All the senior leaders of the current political parties will be given handsome pensions and great retirement benefits. They will be freed from their burden of running political parties so that they can rest peacefully at home. Plenty of intelligence officers and secret police will provide security to them.

The new leaders will be selected and promoted by the ECCI secretly for the wellbeing of the nation.

There will be complete freedom of press. To preserve neutrality, biased news outlets will be banned. No corporate or politically funded news outlet will be allowed to function. Every news outlet will get handsome monetary help from EECI.

Freedom of Speech of the citizens will be respected. Aadhar should be linked with every social media account. However, anyone spreading hatred, falsehood or fake news will be captured and imprisoned with quick trial.

2. Introduce points on driving licence for traffic violations and after accumulation of certain points the DL gets cancelled.
3. For all the above to work either the police has to be efficient and do their duty with corruption or else these should be an automated camera system like Dubai. For the former to work we neet to give incentive to traffic cops on each fines they process SUCCESSFULLY.
4. Move towards a digital India will more incentive for business and customers to use digital/wallets instead of cash. 
5. More jobs or atleast give opportunity to unemployment youth to start their own business. The main reason for all these thugs or goons creating a bad name for India is due to unemployment. 
6. Corruption: this is the biggest problem plaguing India and to eradicate this the people accepting brides have to be actually scared of losing their jobs just like in private sector. So any proven corruption case will directly lead to a termination. 
 

These above and some other changes will create a domino effect and definely make India better they what it is now.

* Build an Atheist History museum instead of le Ram Temple.
* Build science centers everywhere having libraries, laboratories, computers etc. to popularize science education and make it possible for students, no matter their  to pursue their interests.
* The ministry of AYUSH will be disbanded and all alternative medicine quacks will have whatever licences they have revoked. Jail terms and fines abound.
* Gyms, Parks, Playgrounds.

* No religious shit in public. Fuck your traditions and culture.
* Gender-neutral laws.  
* Full support for the LGBT+ community.
* UCC. No personal laws or personal law boards. 
* LOC is the international border. India delivers an apology to the Kashmiri people, and all right-wingers who love to call themselves nationalists will have to spend 1 year helping Kashmir. Patrols, administration, sanitation, labour, art, whatever skills they have will be used for the development of the region. They'll be given a participation certificate and a thanks from the government at the end of the year. Nothing else.
* All BJP/Congress/etc. members sent to Siachen for vacations. Bye. Don't come back.
* amazarashi's Karappo no Sora ni Tsubusareru is the national song. All students are required to learn it, instruments and all. It will be played everywhere on 29 March.
* Build statues of mythological and fictional figures from all around the world in a city specifically created for this purpose. In Gujarat. The smallest statues will be of Jesus and Ram(They already have other ones don't they?). Tallest for Indra cursed with Sahasra Yoni and second-tallest for Fingolfin, the most metal elf to ever exist.

These notes are not for common man.The proper way of using these notes is to fill them in boxes or briefcases before circulation. They were never meant for circulation.

Demonization and then releasing the notes was a planned project to cripple Congress and other political parties Isn't this just normal. How many things can you buy with a 2000 rupee note. 500 rupee note increasing makes sense since at least people will give you back the change with what you buy. Don't worry lads, there is a gps enabled nano chip inside it, the govt can identify who is hoarding all the notes. Why make a 2000 note  and then not make a 1000 note at all which would be way more useful. 

Fucking morons. They are becoming  rare these days. Even in withdrawal from banks they are not giving 2000 notes. Yaha 2000 ka note dekhe hue bhi zamana ho gya Instead of Demo, they should have slowly removed 500 and 1000 notes from circulation and kept the 200 rs note as the maximum denomination. This is how it should be. They should stop printing new notes. They should replace old, damaged and returned rs 2000 notes with smaller denominations (500, 100, 50). Hoarding and cash transactions would then be made difficult. 

This should drive more large value transactions into banking and digital payments. Cash should become medium of last resort, for emergencies or connectivity issues. tatti note saala New black money accumulation has started.",Political,2019-08-30 09:55:53

An acquaintance just called me a terrorist and threatens to expose me; need advice.,137,cqiq2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cqiq2e/an_acquaintance_just_called_me_a_terrorist_and/,54,"Alright, so I posted on my WhatsApp status about the whole acquitting the lynching suspects thing.
This one guy texts me about it and starts saying stuff like ""if you have a problem, go do something"" and shit.

Then he starts with the Kashmir issue.
While I am not against the striking down of 370, I am against human rights violations and stuff. He then proceeds to abuse me, call me cheap (that one I agree with him), anti-national,etc. He went on saying things that made it sound like he thinks that I am a terrorist...
So I asked him 'Do you think I am a terrorist'?
He was like ""yea, you are.""
So I try to explain what I stand for... And he from out of nowhere says ""then come *to a certain place* and say bleed Kashmir and bleed Kashmiri pundits"". I asked him why on earth I'd do that.
He said ""that's your favourite""..  so I asked him why he'd think that when I never said so. Then he proceeds to say he has a screenshot of me saying it and he will put it on twitter.

Now, not only have I never used the team  'bleed Kashmir', I had not even heard that phrase before. I still don't know what it means. 
I am genuinely worried that guy will like fabricate stuff to prove a point. And twitter is just a digital mob  and a kangaroo court, his BS can actually get me into trouble. 
I am also worried he may be a threat to my physical safety as well.


I have anxiety issues and I over think a lot..
Do you guys think I really need to be worried about this or should I stop worrying? 
What should I do?
And how do you handle such people? How common is this kinda thing?

I have never said or even heard that before.
What should I do?",AdmiralSP," Law student here.

>Then he proceeds to say he has a screenshot of me saying it and he will put it on twitter.

Take screenshots of these messages and tell him you'll sue him for defamation, threat of defamation and blackmail.

It should shut him up.

Whatever your acquaintance is doing are just antics. This is how these people should be responded to. Wtf?This shit is getting out of hand. First rule to live happily in India, never discuss politics on WhatsApp groups You can create an exclusion list of folks who cannot see your posts on WhatsApp. Add this dude to it. And block him as well.

I doubt he'd have the balls/inclination to pursue this offline.

There are many Hindus who've been radicalized over the last decade with this constant propaganda and their political moment has arrived. But I'd wager that the urban fucks are not gonna come after you, for now atleast. Keep your mouth shut and ignore any politically flagrant issue.

Unless you are in position to wield political thought.

Also, Twitter is cesspool.

Focus on your daily life for a few months... Use reverse psychology. Ask him to say Bharat mata ki jai or you'll expose him. He won't know what hit him. And this is an example of how extremists bludgeon moderates Is this guy from your workplace? Then report it to hr You need better acquaintances.

Seriously just don’t engage with such idiots. Just ignore and move on. Abhi kuch nahi hoga tension na lo but for next time keep your head down and mouth shut. We are going through rough time as a country. It shall pass but don't know when. What is stopping you from going to twitter first? He will next ask you money, that’s how sanghi thugs operate. Second what other people have said, take screenshots of everything, keep copies, save all conversations. I would like to add though, if you’re not a Hindu (or with a non Hindu name), be a little more careful, especially if you’re Muslim. Toxic social media does tend to attack them more. Archive the conversation, and ignore such people in the future. If you state facts and logic, it work, because they don't care about your pov or truth. 

No matter what, they will continue to do what they believe, so its better to ignore such creatures. I have stopped arguing with people after these election results. Just stop posting things on your FB, WhatsApp or non- anonymous platform. People will come to senses only after the country is ruined just like Germany and Russia. Stay away from such people who cannot comprehend . how many twitter followers are we talking here?

just as general advise: only argue with people who are worthy of some respect.

> “Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.” 
- Mark Twain >So I asked him 'Do you think I am a terrorist'? He was like ""yea, you are.""

We breathing cancerous fucking air and how much you heard about that in the recent elections?
I think we'll get to Mary jane when we get to it. Ramdev Baba to the rescue...

 https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indiatoday.in/amp/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/ramdev-s-patanjali-wants-marijuana-legalised-in-india-social-media-can-t-keep-calm-1165782-2018-02-09 This has been bugging me a lot lately.

Legalization of Marijuana is a half volley for the ruling party to score with the public. Logically they are the Hindu Nationalist party, thumping their chest about glorious ancient past and they are not addressing this facet of that at all. There is not a single public discourse on this. Cannabis *INDICA* is outlawed while whole of the world races ahead in quality, medicinal research, textiles, taxation and Shanti among other things.


The taxation alone is a just cause to pursue the legalization. Try and Do a calculation in your mind about how much the ganja/charas    market in your city is worth anually.

The SKU's range from 50 ki poorhi to 4000 tola.

If this doesn't irk you. Then do a simple water test to check the adulteration in your regular Ganje ka packet waala maal.

90% of the marijuana the people of india consume is below par and 50% of that is just plain shit.

And Oh Lord the Stigma! Cannabis enthusiast? More like ganjedi All hail ramdev, he's pushing for legalization of marijuana. Our country is losing out on a ready to boom market by criminalising Mary Jane. 

Once they ban something in India, it holds (like section 377) the place. There is no looking into it, even as the countries originally responsible for these bans evolve, revoke and move forward. India should adapt to changing times and move forward with innovations in the ganja industry when it’s bound to the surface with more medically proven benefits and India knows it.

Therefore, there is a need for an open discussion regarding this when unregulated criminal markets and increasing number of young people who smokes up can be harmful for a progressive Indian society. It is possible if we come together, make a credible case and demand/vote for it. Start a campaign on how you are a shiv bhakt, and the government is oppressing your religion.

Choose thewir(biased hate the Government) or swaraj (biased protect religion)

Say stuff like Hemant kharkare beat you once ( replace with any other popular Martyr)

Win the ~~election~~ unban Full legalization is far away I think, but decriminalization of medical use might be possible in the near term.

I have been researching the decriminalization/legalization of cannabis in India and it looks quite un-organized to me right now. There used to be The Great Legalization Movement of India, but looks to be defunct now. The clamor in mainstream media has been growing (e.g. an [a recent article](https://qz.com/india/1632037/modi-must-legalise-cannabis-to-tackle-indias-agrarian-distress/), especially around the business/medical aspects of it. At the governmental level the latest was the PMO had asked the [opinion of the Health Ministry](https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/check-benefits-of-cannabis-prime-minister-s-office-tells-health-ministry/story-JJWPQSKcway1zX9zbQ7HLN.html). With a new Health Minister, it's anybody's guess.

I think we need learn from the strategies employed the cannabis legalization movements in US and the gay rights movement in India. The roadmap others have followed is:

1. Medical use exception 
2. Decriminalization of recreational use 
3. Legalization. 

The first step is quite attainable and PIL might be a the fastest way. India banned cannabis due to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs treaty, but WHO's stance has now changed especially with regards to the medicinal use. Even CSIR is [exploring drugs based off cannabis](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/csir-iiim-boheco-to-develop-cannabis-based-drugs-for-cancer-epilepsy-sickle-cell-anemia/articleshow/66773628.cms). Given the facts, I think the government will have a hard time defending the current NDPS law which outright bans all uses of cannabis flower in the Supreme Court.

The second and third steps will take a long time and I think we need a PR and awareness campaign for it. First we should stop calling it cannabis and instead call it bhang/ganja. These two words have much better recall and brand value to us. Social media can play a big role as well. The use of cannabis is on the rise amongst the youth and we should exploit that.

What's unfortunate is that the West has a lead in legalized marijuana business right now and we are being left out, whereas we are the rightful ""heirs"" of this Industry. India has long historical record of cannabis use. The West forced this ban and are now stealing the market away from us. This narrative has not been given it's due in the mainstream media. India's got bigger problems according to our politicians a bill was presented in the parliament to pass it. But thats a dream at least for the next 20 years I'd say not gonna happen Bc adhe logo ko roti nahi mil rahi, baki logo ko meat nahi khane de rahe. Kisi neta k pass time nahi hai humare Maal fookne ko legal karne me time lagae Actually Shivji used it. So banning it is against kulcha In our country we are still finding if weed/cannabis/marijuana has any health benefits while other countries have started producing cannabis based medicine and are now trying to use it for curing cancer or helping cancer patients. I came across a book which had like 100 diseases that can be cured by marijuana ( tuberculosis, seizures or epilepsy, etc.) People in India are just fucking not showing this. In newspapers, i have never read any benefits of marijuana but only thing that I saw and still see is people getting caught. If people's perceptions is changed about cannabis it will be legalized in a year or two because it will benefit all parties. We'll get quality controlled weed they'll get taxes and job employment might increase with benefits to farmers as well and it will make our healthcare system better by reducing prices that we pay for current chemically produced medicines. I know people who take like 7-8 kinds of medicine a day to treat epilepsy whereas thc oil has been proven to cure epilepsy. That 7 vs 1. Just think about it and your welcome to share your thoughts. [deleted] /r/indianents Here people are trying to make alcohol illegal, and you are expecting them to legalize marijuana. Only way to get it legalize is to elect some weed smoking baba in parliament.

Marijuana could definitely be a good source for revenue.

Fuck the US for its war on drugs.MF are responisble for banning of weed in India in the first place and are now legalizing it in their own country.

It's not that big of a political issue for MPs to bother with and it's also not good for your political image to be pro-alcohol and pro-weed. These issues are of developed countries. These is still alot of shit to be done here. That’s never going to happen. Only vegetarian teetotallers are accepted in India! Those countries had to take serious steps because lot of people were incarcerated for it. Not the case here.

States are banning alcohol one by one and ppl want them to ban it. It's unrealistic to make marijuana use more prevalent people don't want it. Achche din and wale hai mitron, apna time ayega. we don't fucking vote for infrastructure and development and you want marijuana to be a political issue.

'Deshbhakti’ curriculum for Delhi government schools: CM Arvind Kejriwal,107,cq87p6,https://indianexpress.com/article/education/deshbhakti-curriculum-for-delhi-government-schools-cm-arvind-kejriwal-5904988/,53,,uakib," Why is 'Deshbhakti' to be taught ? Can you teach someone how to LOVE ? Before a shitstorm starts here, I'd just like to say that Kejriwal's idea of 'deshbhakti' or patriotism is very different from that of BJP's. He does not go shouting at the top of his lungs that India is the best country in the world.

I made a comment on a post almost a year ago:

>Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia came to my college a few weeks ago. Their advice to students: 1. Don't become job seekers, become job givers. 2. Study with the zeal to solve the problems your country faces today. 3. Participate in politics. No, don't join any political party. But please discuss issues. India won't remain a democracy if the society doesn't participate in discussions. Be a responsible and aware citizen when you go out to vote. 

[Link to the original comment.](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9k3g2e/madhya_pradesh_governor_anandiben_patels_advice/e6wbnm5/)

I hope the curriculum of the course reflects the same. The difference between patriotism and nationalism is that the patriot is proud of his country for what it does, and the nationalist is proud of his country no matter what it does; the first attitude creates a feeling of responsibility, but the second a feeling of blind arrogance that leads to war.

Sydney J. Harris

From what I have heard and seen of Kejriwal I think he'll want to teach the kids patriotism. I'm hoping anyways because any little nationalists he creates will want to vote for Modiji so it's just good politics for him. ""Nah. Not enough Deshbhakti. NAMO 2020!!!""

-Delhi, probably Kejriwal is becoming what he said he would never become. If you can't beat them, join them. If Kejriwal starts talking about Deskbhakti, what would BJP go around with? I am neither a bhakt, nor a Congress supporter, but instead of teaching deshbhakti, they should have started teaching humanity. Et tu Kejru So, Patriotism or Nationalism? Just curious, because the distinction is important. Headline is misleading - The curriculum covers liberty, freedom and the constitution. [https://theprint.in/india/education/kejriwal-wants-students-to-be-patriotic-will-introduce-deshbhakti-curriculum-in-schools/276917/](https://theprint.in/india/education/kejriwal-wants-students-to-be-patriotic-will-introduce-deshbhakti-curriculum-in-schools/276917/) i thought this was about teaching constitution to kids and their families? the name is idiotic. should have been called samvidhan. Good. Kejru is finally becoming smart.  

What is this going on in India? Instead of making them all of student well educated they are putting garbage in their minds. If you provide students a good environment then you don't need to teach such type of rubbish things. F\*\*K OFF INDIAN EDUCATION SYSTEM. Only way to deal with current way of BMKJ.

I don’t know if Shah Jahan hated India or not, but his monument to his wife sucked so much money that it caused a famine around Agra. The less said about Aurangzeb the better. Akbar, on the other hand, is a fascinating, multi faceted ruler and was respected by many of his enemies.

Europe started its renaissance around the time the Mughal empire started, and they never looked back. The Mughals were happy being stationary and the gap kept widening. They for example rejected technologies like the printing press even when it was brought to them.

This. It's for this reason why this act is so dangerous. I bet a very few understand the repercussions of this. Don't like the govt's policies and rant about it on social media? You CAN be declared a terrorist. It's also going to be very convenient for the Central government to label some low rung party worker from the opposition as a terrorist. Just think about it.

Definitely terrorists of all kinds should be punished but innocent people should not be put in jail just to calm down tempers or hide the failure of the establishment in preventing attacks > ""It is important to designate individuals as terrorists as they start new organisations once an outfit is banned,"" said Mr Shah.

Yes, but why does this problem arise in the first place? It comes up because our law enforcement agencies are weak in general and weaker against such outfits. If they do their job without political interference and given the right incentives, most of these issues would be solved like most developed countries do. But here, we don't want to solve the core of the problem. Amit Shah would be nervous as he has a lot to lose from an independent law enforcement agency with teeth.

First, we don't do our job. Then, we create an artificial problem and then we come up for a solution to this artificial problem! The label of a terrorist to an individual gives the political class two benefits - (i) It allows them to create a smokescreen and distract the society from the core issue and (ii) it gives them another political tool for oppression.

This should've been done a long time ago. Ever since Jayalalitha died, this state went into shambles. Only thing we could do is pray that 2015-like rains occur in Chennai so that our ground water fills up. iirc, our geography books in high school taught us about Rainwater harvesting and its successful implementation in Tamil Nadu. It said that TN has transformed itself from water deficit to water sufficient using rainwater harvesting. So how exactly did such a problem of water deficiency occur? The problem is most people think they are outside the system, The rainwater harvesting policy was implemented in 2001, but people find it easier to bribe officials during construction and then blame the govt for not doing anything. The Electorate does not hold its elected representative responsible when a lake/tank magically transforms into a high-rise.

Job done. Is it possible to implement rainwater harvesting in already built houses and apartments? . if so the government should do it asap. If that's not possible then at least newly built homes should have rainwater harvesting. I can't see any immediate solution for this problem tbh. The problem is exacerbated by various factors:

1) Local body elections which were due in 2016 have not been held yet. There's just no1 who can be held accountable by people. This problem was evident during cyclone Gaja when people were struggling and hoping for someone for some kind of accountability. Unless we strengthen our local bodies we have no hope. Lakes and ponds will continue to get encroached, Cooum will continue to stink and the city will soon be uninhabitable. 

2) Don't think ruling party really cares about anything anymore (except for holding on to power till 2021). They know they are heading for defeat and so don't have good governance as priority. DMK is waiting for ADMK to implode. Unless we have good monsoon this year we are doomed. Yes, can start a water bucket challenge on social media.

Jus that there would be no water in the bucket. lol as long as your nepotist parties are in power, you can forget about anything being taken serious immediately. Protests, social media campaigns. Groups making policy suggestions.

2019 General Election 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election I'm sorry if I'm going to hurt anyone's sentiments by saying this, but this shows that we as a country only believe in blindly following the crowd. Till the time we actually start realising that questioning moves made by a particular government is not equivalent to questioning the government, those in power will continue to divide us because it works in their favour. Moves by any government -- whether it's BJP, Congress or any other party -- must be questioned because these are people chosen by us to work for our growth and benefits. If they are incompetent, we must not reward them with blind loyalty, no matter who they are.

I won't be surprised to see another map like this 20 years from now with some other party in majority because someone from there will be getting hero-worshipped. Unfortunately, this is what we have always done. Worshipped people like they are god and then felt cheated when their real faces were uncovered, if that happens at all. source?",Political,2019-05-30 01:43:42

We need to sell this idea to poor Kashmiris that way they won't have to worry about anything. Auto Rickshaws are stopped and fined by ,

Police also stops them but Auto drivers know to deal with them. They form one massive part of the vote population. Them and their family. Nobody wants to disturb that balance.

Hypothetically, if they are stopped, a phone call from the correct political person is enough to allow them to carry on. Because they're poor and likely won't give as much bribe as compared to someone in BMW The cops do catch auto drivers when they go on a one way or signal jumping. In Bangalore, the auto drivers association donates/bribes the corporator, mlas on regular basis. So most of the times they are let go with a warning. दोस्त, यह हमारे ब्रह्माण्ड का सबसे महत्वपूर्ण सवाल है। The other Auto rikshaws drivers will swarm around and lynch the cop who dares to do that.

Maybe, just maybe it is an attempt to divert media attention.   



*Tin foil hat off*     



Good job on intelligence agencies. They are really the unsung heroes A few [*Hindu Munani* terrorists](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hindu-munnani-members-held-assaulting-pilgrims-walking-velankanni-church-107603) were arrested recently by the TN police as they sought to create communal disturbance by attacking a christian group going to a christian holy place. 

I've always said this, religious fundamentalists of the opposing side always work in tandem because it benefits them. Here the *Sanghis* are stoking the flames to start communal riots, while the *Jihadis* will come with their fear-mongering and ISI trained militants to add to it. Once both community are polarized, it becomes a fertile breeding ground for both to recruit new members and further their agenda. 

[Note that Coimbatore in TN is a specific target for both the *Sanghis* and *Jihadis*](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-alert-in-coimbatore-following-intel-about-terrorist-intrusion/article29226339.ece). The *Sanghis* were able to successfully start a riot here more than a decade back, which ensured that the *Jihadis* were able to recruit and start their own local terrorist outfit (the *Al-Umma*) which proceeded to terrorise the city with bomb blasts. And ofcourse, the BJP reaped rich political rewards and was abe to win a few elections from here (one of the few places in TN from where they could win). But ofcourse, this time the Modi ""wave"" seemed to skip Coimbatore, and the BJP couldn't win this constituency.

So if you live in Coimbatore be very careful - while there is no indication that the AIADMK, a political puppet of the BJP has succumbed to the RSS's ideology, who knows how much pressure Amit Shah may put on them ... Rumour has it that they went back after seeing Tamil films. Same thing happened with Kashmir, high alert for the supposed amarnath attack

This year also the situation is not different, where, the whole Maharashtra dams are full, but in our district still water is distributed by tankers ( And by the end of this month if we do not have high rainfall then local govt. has planned to bring water by train again like 2 years ago in mid Of Rainy season), you might get scarcity of water in this region. 

  
In my locality, every house is now conserving rainwater ( They not allow roof water to get flow in drains rather they conserve it in the tank or in-ground). Even after a battering by the rains? >soon?

It's already happening for last two years. There should be more rain water harvesting because it's been raining here for a month already I didn't except this crisis so early....its happening..oh god But it will be Pakistan who suffers Soon is an understatement If the current govt doesn't takes some measurable actions in the next year or two to save water then I will thought of them as using the opportunity to further incite religious hatred in the name of water and it may very well lead to bloodbath.

In this frank exchange with NH, he hauls TV news channels over the coals. 

Excerpts:

> **What do you think happened to the Indian media in the last four years?**  

> Unfortunately, the media have been serving only the powers that be and generating controversies that serve their purpose. ***There are diversions being created to take attention away from serious issues.***The Aligarh Muslim University controversy is a case in point. It is an engineered controversy and so was the controversy around JNU ...

> **Hasn’t TV always played a role in politics?**  

> TV played a huge role in Narendra Modi’s quest for power and in sustaining his charisma while in power. And now it is playing a role in his quest to return to power. Political parties now have their own feed and they provide the channels with the footage ... This way the visuals are being controlled. This is being used to create a wave ... ***The opposition have to fight Television first if they wish to safeguard democracy.***

> **Are media owners hobnobbing with the Government or the journalists as well?**

> ***It is a good time for journalists who choose to support the Government.*** All that they are expected to do is to report on what the Government and the ministries have forwarded them ...

> **But people do draw parallels with the Emergency and believe that an unnecessary fuss is being made over what is happening now …**  

> I will not look at the present through the glass of history.Were people singing folklores in praise of the Emergency? Did people write books praising Emergency?  Even during the Emergency and after it was lifted, people were critical and opposition parties struggled relentlessly against the Emergency unlike today’s opposition.The media too was critical of the move. And in the name of what happened then, how can we take what is happening today lightly? We take democracy very lightly.

> ***What is Television doing currently? It is humiliating the opposition and running it down. By opposition, I do not mean only the political opposition.*** The first opposition to the ruling establishment are the people, the civil society. The electronic media is ridiculing this opposition and providing them no space to raise their concerns. Television as a medium is not only anti-democratic, but also completely anti-citizen.

> **Smriti Irani feels there is need to monitor media, especially social media. What do you feel about it?**  

> I’ve not followed it up closely enough. But they feel that things at times get out of hand on social media when people start questioning and criticising the government on certain issues ... On social media, there is still some space as people write, they circulate jokes. For instance, the social media was full of jokes after the Prime Minister’s Pakoda remarks ... People who are propagating hate, obscurantism, what has the government done against them? Nobody is talking about fake news, instead they themselves propagate the content of fake news in their rallies ...

> **Is there a similarity between Hitler’s Germany and Modi’s India?**  

> ***There is similar mob-culture and propaganda politics in India currently*** ... I’m really afraid that he is going to end up dead. Such an awesome personality. Few news channels are pretty frustrating to watch these days. They crush a topic till they have maxed all possible ways to stupidify it.

Shameful it is this is not the first time they are doing it.... Till IPR laws are strengthen this shit would keep on occurring ...and government has taken to lead with bad example.... We are miserably failing ourselves by letting such scumbags rule us Thief is what theif does!! Well its not their fault. All their money got demonetised and their paytm account got blocked so they couldn't spend 600 rs.

Kaka will bring back the good times soon! glad to see the muftkhori runs deep even in people with deep pockets.

you are not alone my fellow BPL indian, BJP is right there in spirit along with you :P Disappointed... If you vote Modi they'll give you your thanks /s Mera desh mahan sau ke sau baeman. And BJP has tons of money from it's corporate donors.  BJP has raised Rs 1,027 crore in 2017-18 and spent Rs 758 crore while the congress has raised just Rs 199 crore.  Put this over youtube, make mass whatsapp forwards. Get more audience. Else nobody would care. I'm really proud of you guys for bringing this up to them in the first place. If the root is rotten, nothing good will grow, this thing may be small for many but goes to show you how firm their moral values are and what would that bring to us. How can you work for a democracy if you can't respect and give credit to someone for their work. All they do is cover things up. Sue them for costs and copyright violations, and then sue them for defamation for continuing to use your code and show it as your code after having disfigured the nice page you designed. I suggest 1000000 crore suit, commensurate with the largest party status. File it in Ahmedabad, where you don't have to give a percentage of the claimed amount as surety to the court. It's Nehru's fault. You say how?

> It's Nehru's fault. [removed] Though I hate the BJP with all my life, I would say this is a problem with India and Indians in general. It isn't because it was the BJP that they did this to them.

It is because they were Indians. We Indians are the most disrespectful, vilest pieces of shit that exist on this planet. We just don't care about things like privacy, being respectful, giving credit where it's due and so on.

The only additional problem they'll have with the BJP is that they'll be threatened with dire consequences if they take it to court. Did you post it on r/India ? Don't be sad. They plagiarize all good things done by other parties and later blame them. 

It's their common template.  Jokes aside pretty sure many people here pirate content (including me sometimes). Probably the Gujarat IT cell.  Now some moron is trying to cover up his mistake.  It's easier than running back to his superiors to get permission again. It is great that you bring this up.  This, however, was probably done by an outsourced contractor... 

Blaming a whole political party for an IT decision is a stretch. You shouldve made this an india-pak issue clickbait, wouldve gotten more upvotes for visibility atleast :(. hope you find a solution!  Their website down again? I'm thinking the guy who designs the site and does upkeep would get a certain amount for the new layout and instead of working on it just ripped it off your site. You can't say the whole party is responsible but they should issue a statement if they've been caught doing such a thing. Chowkidar ki chowkidari kaun karega? 😛 They have co-opted Ambedkar, Patel, Gandhi, Bose etc. Who are you? Vote for the cheif minister which had done some development, rather than going all out in the name of modi.
Now that I think, you would hear people say modi not bjp. Like modi sArkar.  We would have given permission...

Besides lancet has written about Palestine, about rohingya, about the Syrian Christians etc. If they wanted to do something they should have raised their voices and told the lancet about it.

More stunning is that they do not even hide their hate towards Muslims. It's ok for the Muslims to suffer because Kashmir pandits suffered 40 years ago. Lets all go for an eye for an eye approach. This being an orgination of doctors makes it even more unethical as these people are supposed to practice without prejudices. But here their Islamophobic ideals are open for the whole world to see.

With mindless development in the cities putting water resources in stress, pollution going out of control, lack of ample employment opportunities for the youth, increased criminalization of politics and what not, this sub keeps providing ""emigrate"" as a solution. Can we discuss and find unexpected places in India itself where like-minded people can form a community based on values and live in harmony with nature, away from the problems urban people are facing? Suggestions please.
Keep in mind, there is a future generation for which a lot of people want to migrate, the predominant thought being ""we want to give our children a quality life"". Possible? Somewhere else in India?",AshamedAmoeba," Become rich. India is big, move to other region of India;a different state. Chandigarh. Consider Bihar. Get a remote job, and move to the city/town (not the biggest) that you like the most in your state. North East. Quality of life is pretty much the same throughout India no matter where you go. Even if you do find a corner in India that's marginally better than the rest it gonna pale in comparison to rich developed countries. 

The only real alternative is to get rich or die trying. And again you have a way better chance of becoming a millionaire in America than you do in India. Start a business. Take risks. Gain money, clout, employees and eventually control.

There are industry associations you can join and push local policy makers towards some sense. It will be slow and painful, but the only real option available. >Can we discuss and find unexpected places in India itself where like-minded people can form a community based on values and live in harmony with nature, away from the problems urban people are facing? 

Only if you can live with shitty or no internet, no good hospitals nearby, no good schools nearby, no repair/service shops nearby, conservative people in the surrounding villages, very limited choice of consumer goods. etc. There is no other advice, sadly!

I want to plant tons of cannabis trees. And hope that people rediscover innate connection with nature through that. Read about Auroville in Pondicherry. One such community ..

I am looking to join/start one somewhere once I finish my studies.

Go to a remote village and develop farming, schools. If you are from Andhra and have similar ideas, feel free to pm. We'll discuss. I think such a community has to be political in nature which is what people who want to embark on such projects often ignore. Not everybody wants to live in harmony with nature, not because they are ""bad people"" but because they don't have a concept of environmental degradation. You could say ""education"" could solve all these problems but formal education is often in conflict with the education that daily life provides and the latter usually wins. There are only a tiny number of people in India who have a concept of environmental degradation and are schooled in modernity, both in its drawbacks and advantages. But, they are are largely drowned out by the majority. I guess what I am trying to say is that if these like-minded people need to thrive, they need to be able to keep out those that are not like them. It is only a matter of time before any new initiative in India attracts the unhealthy interest of the masses. How are you going to keep them out? 

The only way to do that is to build a political community: a nation-state on Indian soil but away from Indians. If you think a tiny number of people can go to a place and be left alone you've got another thing coming. You really need to be in complete control of your physical environment and that can only be achieved with political power. Before a nation-state can be built however, a people need to be identified. The only constituency that cares for the issues that you have outlined are Westernised Indians. There are not many of them but I would estimate there are at least a million or two. A people that have been identified now need to seek out a separate space for themselves where they can practise their culture and pursue their dreams and this space needs to be protected from outside interference. However, it has not occurred to these people to build a separate space for themselves. The idea that there is a middle-ground between living in ""India"" and migrating abroad needs to be communicated to them. Once this idea takes hold an area needs to be identified. Somebody suggested the North-East but I think that is too far from our areas of inhabitance, I suggest Goa and parts of Maharashtra. I suggest Westernised Indians move there in large numbers. I think one reason the concerns of Westernised Indians are often rendered invisible is because there are so few of them, so they need to consolidate their numbers in one physical space and gradually accrue the power necessary to build a separate nation-state. Aside from that, I don't see any hope for building an ecologically-sustainable and culturally-sound existence in India. An Indian Eureka eh Jammu and Kashmir!

What is this new thing? Why is Gandhi suddenly being demonized? Is it only because of Gandhiji's last name,gigibuffoon," [How the RSS Detested Gandhi](https://thewire.in/politics/how-the-rss-detested-gandhi)

> In this excerpt from his recent biography of Gandhi, Ramachandra Guha documents the intense and at times venomous hatred that the RSS and its long-serving sarsanghchalak, M. S. Golwalkar, had for the Mahatma They try to shift the blame from their precious Savarkar (who actually suggested a Two nation theory and even worked with the Muslim League) onto Gandhi. Like someone else said, these hypocrites would be first to cry if India actually had Pakistan's additional Muslim population. The Narrative goes like this. Many people (out side of this bubbled sub reddit) believe that Gandhi was the the main reason of India-Pakistan partition. After playing a major role in division of India Gandhi was also trying to convince Indians to also financially aid Pakistan. This pissed off many *nationalists* at that time and they believed, if this continues , India will keep on losing both, its land and wealth due to Gandhi. This lead to Nathuram Godse killing Mahatma Gandhi. Now obviously you can't just *kill* someone you disagree with and Godse by *definition* *is* a *terrorist*. Now coming to the present day people, Most of them (which are outside this bubbled sub) believe that Nehru and Gandhi did more harm than good for this country by making some *questionable decisions* and Godse actually did India a *favour* by getting *rid* of him. Now is this ideology *correct* is upto you to decide. Hope this clears the picture Because he was the first man to kill the symbol of India. By killing Gandhi, Godse sent a message that there are separatist within the India who do not accept the idea of a free and united India. By coopting Godse The BJP and the RSS gives a clear message that their motive is to bring India into their ideological framework, and burry the idea of India into the history books and bring in a new nation, a Hindutva nation. 

Gandhi is the only symbol in India that truly stands for a united strong nation. A nation Built on the platform of nonviolence, a truly Indian way of achieving freedom, that connects us back to the teachings of the vedas of acceptance and unity. We are after all strong when united in diversity. Sanghis who want minorities in India to exist as second class citizens want us to believe that they stood for akand Bharat. How would this have ever worked with an even larger Muslim population in provinces that were largely Muslim? They always wanted a divided India( just read that traitor  Savarkars books) but blame Gandhi who fought for independence for all of us and had difficulty in seeing Pakistan as separate and different from India even after partition. This is a very old thing. Sanghis hate gandhi and our secular constitutional democracy with a rule of law.

They distributed pedhas on the day he was killed by the coward.

They kept quiet long enough to solidify their grip on power, and now they're baring their teeth. The narrative goes something like this: Gandhiji was responsible for the partition of the country and the creation of Pakistan. Godse was a true patriot who couldn't stand the division of his motherland and hence chose to kill Gandhi. 

Of course, it is complete horseshit but some people use it to justify their blind hatred towards Nehru and Gandhi. Nathuram Godse was independent India's first terrorist.

Sanghis have historically been British bootlickers. These are the real Anti National scums.

Hindu Mahasabha and Muslim League wanted partition. Had partition not happened then these half chaddi Sanghis would be the first one to bitch about higher % of Muslims.

These Anti Nationals disguised as right wingers hail Godse because he took steps in fulfiling their agenda of harming the secular fabric of this country. Just like killing of progressive politicians by muslim jihadi scums are hailed by a lot of people in Pakistan, it is the same here in India for hindu jihadis like Godse. It's because Godse being a RSS-terrorist makes them look bad. 

In fact their entire history during the independence struggle makes it obvious that they were a bunch of anti-national shitbags. Kid you not, I know 3 people who support Godse and RSS vehemently. Makes me shudder at times The way I always thought it happened is like this.
RSS and Muslim League hope and work to get 2 different states with Islam and Hinduism as the state religions. But before it could happen Gandhiji with the INC steps in and declares that all religions are welcome in India and that the country would be secular without any state religion. This probably felt like a betrayal to all the hardliners over at RSS and the general unkill and aunty population right now.
Just a speculation so take it with a grain of salt. Gandhi wanted to promote interfaith dialogue and Hindu Muslim unity Short answer : Because they are fucktards. If you go to the core of It all this happened a while ago in 1947-50 right?

why should anyone care really no one cares,yes you are right, I think even Pragya/Modi do not care what happened to godse/Gandhi . what they are doing is shifting the overton window.

Because he killed a Muslim appeaser -Mahatma Gandhi. The core 25% Hindutva base believes in this. Because for 3 generations they've tried to create a Gandhi cult. And now people are fighting it with equal and opposite stupidity because they wanna normalise it and somehow bring it close to Gandhi's level. My advice would be to just refer him as gandhi killer and not actually use his name or make his name more widespread. Because BJP is in power Partition would have happened in any case barring who called for it .

>“Whereas the ‘religions of the book’, that is, Islam and Christianity, bind the faithful by demanding obedience to the letter and the spirit of their revealed dogmas, Hinduism deploys familiar rituals, festivals, myths and observances- the kind of things children learn on their mothers’ knees- to knit a many-stranded rope that binds the faithful to the faith with so many little ties, at so many different points that **one loses sight of the ideological indoctrination that is going on.** Ordinary worshipers and the three partners described above- the state, the temples, and the corporate or business interests- perform a choreographed dance, as it were, in which each element merges into another smoothly and effortlessly. The net result is a new kind of political and nationalistic Hinduism which is invented out of old customs and traditions that people are fond of, and familiar with.”

Conceptualizing India As An Empire,9,cvkjiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cvkjiy/conceptualizing_india_as_an_empire/,12,"I have a very serious question to ask people here. In my view, a significant number of issues that we are facing at the moment is because of the tension between the philosophical idea of India as a nation state, and the lived reality of it as anything but. A nation-state by definition, requires most of its citizens to be members of the same 'nation', by dint of a common language, ethnicity, or religion- none of which are true in India. A nation state also expects a certain level of uniformity across its populace- again something that is not applicable (or desirable) in India. It forces distinct communities to conform to the expectations of the majority (howsoever defined). In such a scenario would it help to re-conceptualize India as a 'republican empire' (with no prejudice or judgment on the use of the term 'empire'). In any imperial state, different regions and different peoples have differing relationships with the central imperium- some are closer and some are more tenuous. Would viewing India as such a republican empire help more people accept that some regions/groups might have a very different relationship to the state than others? (Again the use of the term 'empire' is not meant to be a value-judgement).",Imperial_India," Yes. You are right but I would not use the word Imperial for it. I would rather go with Federalism. Although, what we achieved in Kashmir is more closer to Imperialism. 

Anyhow, we need to inculcate the idea that India is a Union of its states and not one nation-state. The more it tries to become one nation-state, greater the chances of it breaking apart in my opinion. [deleted] I kinda had the same thoughts after reading an author on Quora who's a bit out there but has the most fascinatingly nihilistic takes on the utter futility of Human life. I'll try and add somewhat to your point about how India differs from any other country in the world (and why that's not a good thing). Ultimately I have no clue about what India's philosophy is or what the so called ""Idea of India"" is but whatever it is, it seems to be working till now. 

So most of the stuff below this are excerpts from their answers on various different questions. I think it helped crystallise my thoughts about why India is an empire (not in the bad sense but in the value neutral sense) so you might like it.

I don't think India ever really intended to be a Nation-State or that anyone calls us that. A Wilsonian nation-state was a good idea solely in Europe where they had genocided each other for centuries to create nice little monolithic ethnic blocks spread out throughout the continent. The one exception to his plans were the Germans who, pre-1945, had the irritating (to the Anglo-Saxon World) of spreading everywhere like flies- from Alsace to Wallachia. 

So, the Allies genocided the Germans everywhere outside 'Germany'.

Ever seen some of the huge Churches in the Balkans & Poland? More than half of them have little in common with what the Slavs have built. It's pure German stuff. Well, ask yourself- where are the Germans? If you bother to read up on the Crusaders, you'd find that most of these 'French' Crusaders actually had all sort of Germanic names. Well, where are they all now? The answer is that post WW2 the allies ethnically cleansed all the Germanic people from the surrounding countries and forced them back into Germany (or the German borders). They did this to prevent a strong Germany from then doing what Russia is now doing in Crimea. There's a reason that India is so worried about Bangladeshi immigration into the North East, ultimately blood will tell.


Turkey (& Russia & India & other peoples like us) had one great problem during the twentieth century. We simply hadn't committed enough genocide. Multi-ethnicity is one of the greatest challenges a Nation-State can face. It doesn't work. Period. It might work in America where they put everything in a belnder & create some sort of fetid stinking nonsense, or in India which is the greatest exception in the history of everything- but it usually never works.

A nation's raison d'être is its culture. Culture- as defined by the ideology, religion, history- of a people is the most potent weapon they can wield against their enemies. Thus,we find that, taken in context, the history-less American Empire is far weaker than its purported Spiritual successors- the Imperial British & the Romans.

The corollary to this is that any Nation capable of 'forging' its own culture enjoys a huge advantage over its rivals. On an even greater sense- a nation that is capable of forcing an alien culture upon another nation is at the peak of its existence and capacity, and thus, truly deserves the title 'Empire'. Rome was capable of this. The Mauryas were capable of this. So were the Ming & the Showa Japanese. I would say USI (United States of India) could be a better idea. >by dint of a common language, ethnicity, or religion- none of which are true in India.

This is getting predictable. 

Is there selective outrage? There is. Does it excuse running lynch mobs? It doesn't. 

Btw, it's absurd that the letter condemns the previous letter for mentioning lynchings as it ""denigrates"" India, while also talking about Naxals. If it is denigrating to talk about lynchings, does it elevate India to talk about Naxal attacks?

As for ""tukde tukde"" gang, the point must be made that the biggest tukde tukde gang in India is the BJP. Yogi Adityanath has publicly stated that Hindus and Muslims cannot live together in this country and the BJP has never disputed that idea; in fact they made him CM after that remark. If you can't stop every single crime in this country, don't try to stop any one thing. Aw, look at them being so concerned about what's happening in Bengal. We have a history of violence that dates back to 50 years or more - why didn't we hear from you anytime in the past? This 'open letter' reeks of BJP IT-cell stench. By their logic if you have never spoken against injustice in the past then you have no right to speak now or in the future. You have kept quiet and learned to bear it all till now so don't start speaking ever again. Wah re India.

Also, why is tukde tukde gang still a thing? Hasn't it already been determined that that was fake news? Why keep bringing it up? BJP or RSS, don't know who but created this environment where not the political parties but people/personalities themselves have taken such political issues head on and fighting with each other...

Few people (allegedly leftist) wrote to PM about recent mob lynching of minorities in India and now few 'more' people (definitely rightist) wrote to PM over Selective outrage...Whereas PM is as usual Not uttering a word! As usual the entire universe is a conspiracy against the perennially victimized retard wingers I used to like Kangana. Why did she have to go all looney I don't understand...

Overestimated the number, but at least predicted it'll  be > 49. The behaviour of these childish rightwingers is so predictable LOL. Your outrage outrages me Prasoon fucking Joshi. Might as well have written BJP on the top of letter. Kangana totally lost her shit. I read that as ""lynchist"" Prasoon Joshi. 

My brain is corrupted. Chutiyon ki fauj bc They are waiting for someone of their own to get lynched Some people gave their opinion and some people gave their opinion. I dont but its like civil war in bollywood. in sab ko ek ek award . Can someone give me the gist of what happened and all the important points to date please? Open letters are good for igniting discussion, but that's not going to lead to a concrete outcome. Concrete outcomes are possible only through action. If you want to see intolerance in India going down, then please join us at r/GanjaMarch.

I believe that ganja legalization in India will reduce intolerance, lower our crime rates, lower suicide rates, improve mental health, lead to lesser sexual abuse and and reduce addiction rates of alcohol, tobacco and hard drugs. All these outcomes have been proven by post-legalization studies in the West already. These are also the reasons why our culture advocates moderate consumption of ganja, which we were doing till 1985.

And I think pre-1985 India was more tolerant and positive about us, our generation. But do we feel the same about the next generation? I want to desperately, but if I look at the increasing income inequality and worsening climate change, I find it very hard to be optimistic about them.

> Then they barged into the house and killed three members of the panic stricken family. The eldest son's eyes were gouged out, another hacked to death and the third chased across the neighbourhood and butchered in a neighbour's house he tried to hide in.

These cases will shake the humanity out of everyone. Motherfuckers. At present Bengal is 'ruled' by TMC and slowly going at the cusp of BJP. I have friends who are concerned about the future of Bengal rightly so, bcs it's definitely not going in the right direction. But what I have noticed even the hardline BJP supporters talk in reverence about CPIM. They use the word 'shikkito'(educated) and 'vodro' (well-behaved) while talking about CPIM leaders. Even my friends who were barely  or twelve or thirteen years of age in 2011 when CPIM was defeated also feel  'nostalgic' about CPIM rule. It really baffels me whenever I hear this! If these leaders were what they were supposed to be none of these would have happened. 
 
In Marichjhapi they imposed an economic blockade even after High Courth ruled against it. Correct me If I'm wrong here Ashok Mitra,who did his Ph.D under Tinbergen, was then finance minister of Bengal back then. They hired Muslim goons to fire up the religious sentiment! 

Nirupam Sen,the leader mentioned in the post was the industrial minister of Bengal.He was from Burdwan.When he died his body was brought back to Burdwan for his last rites.I was quite surprised to see such a large number of people gathering to see their beloved Comrade for the last time. Burdwan was once called the bastion of CPIM. Guess what was the reason!!! Over 100 million victims of Communist regimes in the last 100 years. Communists have killed 4 times as many people as the Nazis. Most brutal and fascist ideology in the world. I don't know why so many 'intellectuals' are leftist.

"India's political climate has striking similarities to the Legend of the Galactic Heroes. If it continues to play out the way it is now, the end result is the defeat of the Free Planets Alliance.",0,cqh2k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cqh2k6/indias_political_climate_has_striking/,2,"Okay, so most of you have probably never heard of Legend of the Galactic Heroes (LotGH), so all I can recommend is that if you have even a slight interest in intellectually invigorating and somewhat wordy and slow-paced TV shows, give this one a try and watch at least the main series, which is 110 episodes long. Forgive me if some of this goes over your head, since I'll try to keep it simple without revealing too much about the show.

For the rest of you hindustani weebs (we have a [subreddit](/r/HindustaniWeeb)\* for it kek), I shouldn't have to say much more, but for the sake of the ones who are out of the loop, here goes.

Basically, the gist is, in LotGH, most of the Milky Way has been colonised and Earth (Terra) is nothing more than a frontier planet of minor significance. For various reasons (watch the show to find out) the galaxy has been divided into three parts - two superpowers, the Free Planets Alliance (FPA) and the Galactic Empire (Empire), and one small neutral territory with a lot of economic clout called Phezzan (or Fezzan).

As you can guess from what was said earlier, the FPA is at war with the Empire and has been for a _really_ long time. From the name you can tell that the Empire is exactly what the name implies, a monarchy, while the FPA is its foil - a democracy with elections to contest. Sub-national politics is not given any importance, so I cannot say how unitary or federal their government is.

The FPA has an RSS/VHP/nationalist-equivalent called the Patriotic Knights Corps (PKC). In reality they're just the henchmen of Job Trunicht, a politician who is introduced first as the Secretary of Defence and then the National Council Chairman. People who speak out against him are attacked in an attempt to silence them and enable the government's propaganda.

As you can probably guess, the FPA's politicians are extremely corrupt. They are more concerned with winning elections than governing their country. This leads them to consider a highly risky military campaign against the Empire. As SecDef, Trunicht is so corrupt that he actually argues in favour of launching that aforementioned campaign, while when it comes to a vote, he chooses the opposite stance. So he is able to create the public perception that he is not in favour of needless spending. The rest of the members of the council laugh off the pacifists who care more about governance than winning elections.

Obviously, the campaign is approved, and predictably it is such a major disaster that the FPA economy is shattered and their military is reduced to a shadow of itself. Unsurprisingly, the government falls and Trunicht gets that coveted chairmanship, since he had earlier popularised himself as a pragmatist.

When the Empire launches a punitive campaign in retaliation, he leads his country to a defea at the hands of the Empire, ordering his army to stand down when they're about to kill the Emperor because Heinessen, the capital, is under siege.

After that, he actually goes to the same Emperor who defeated him, looking for a job!

**How does this relate to the India?**

The parallel I am trying to draw is that Narendra Modi is playing a dangerous game, behaving very similarly to Job Trunicht. His government has taken all sorts of ridiculous steps in the previous term and this one which have weakened the economy, increased jingoism, drowned out dissent and opposition, increased polarisation of the electorate, and subverted democratic process and procedure. His bhakts, his IT cell, and the presstitutes under his thumb collectively make up the PKC, deciding what an ignorant people should be thinking. Unlike the FPA, which still had freedom of the press to a large extent, that is sadly not the case in India at the moment.

Pretty much every action that his government has taken has been timed to reap dividends during elections. At the end of this year, Haryana, Jharkhand, Sikkim and Maharashtra go to polls this year, and Jammu & Kashmir may have their elections in 2020, along with Bihar. A whole bunch of important states will have elections in 2021 as well, and these elections will inevitably have an effect on the populace there, along with any other so-called masterstrokes that Modi's government will take.

I do not claim to know under whose orders Modi is acting (Trunicht was under the orders of someone else), or whether he is acting independently. However I do know that if this goes on for the remainder of his long four and a half years in power, at a time of increasing geopolitical and economic instability, it won't be very long before the damage to the fabric of this country is made semi-permanent and we lose a decade of progress to people like him. As I mentioned in another thread, none of his actions truly damage the poor in the short term, and they lack the education to realise the long term damage that they get.

I also do not claim to know an alternative, however I do know that an unrestrained power is dangerous. The recent political tumults in Kashmir have shown that the government is not shy to restrain people they consider dangerous to their political ideology.

What's worse is that the governor of Jammu & Kashmir withdrew his invitation to RaGa just because he asked that he be allowed to tour the area freely, instead of the guided tour *a la* [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_North_Korea) that was offered to him.

> Sivadasan was among the around 8,000 persons picked up during Emergency in Kerala and subjected to unspeakable police brutality during the darkest 19 months of Indian democracy.

> “**No other political protest anywhere in the world had seen 1.75 lakh political activists put in prison at a given time**,” says Vaikkom Gopakumar, 70, who was then RSS chief in Alappuzha. He was arrested on August 1, 1976, for spearheading various protests against Emergency. After his arrest, the police kept him in an old building near the police station at Muppalam in Alappuzha and assaulted him for 16 days. “The police would take me to a corner and bang my head against a wall and it would rebound and hit the next wall,” says Gopakumar.

> The officer who headed the interrogation room, Gopinathan Nair, **used to drag Gopakumar by holding on to his penis and scrotum**. “It was a new technique the officer experimented on me,” he says.

> “When I was brought to the magistrate’s house, the officer left me outside and went in to get the documents signed. I was in bad shape after 16 days of torture,” he says. “My eyes were swollen. I could not stand after they rolled wooden stick over my legs and hit my spine,” he says.

> Sivadasan recalled how the police used to ‘fly aeroplane’ on protesters. “They tied my arms behind my back and made me run in the room while constantly kicking me and hitting me with the butt of the rifle,” he says.

> After nine days of brutality, he was sent to Thiruvananthapuram Central Prison. He remained in jail for 16 months and was out on March 22, 1977, after Emergency was revoked.

> Pai, who had participated in satyagraha, was picked up thrice by police. Only on the last arrest was he sent to Ernakulam Sub-Jail. “Once an officer put two claws of chicken in his ears and gave him the dreaded double ear slap. He has been deaf since then,” says Raveendran, a former president of Kasaragod’s BJP unit. God it boils my blood whenever I see it. Congress should be kept out of the parliament at any cost This is how every dictator starts out, by declaring a state of emergency and things never go back to the way they were.

Its very strange then that Indira Gandhi gave up all this control and went for general elections in such short duration. You have to really believe in democracy to make that step, knowing full well that you have antagonized the population enough to lose.

I wonder then what her motivations were for the emergency if they weren't absolute power or control. I mean I understand the trigger, the Supreme Court judgement, but there has to be more to it if she decided to go back to the way democracy functioned.

Perhaps there actually was enough foreign interference and threat from the CIA to warrant it, especially since the USA was pretty anti-India during those times.

Pepsi withdraws Indian potato farmer lawsuits after political pressure,212,bk1565,https://in.reuters.com/article/us-india-pepsi-farmers/pepsi-withdraws-indian-potato-farmer-lawsuits-after-political-pressure-idINKCN1S817I,37,,gilbertelf," That's no ""political pressure"". The assholes realized that their sales are soon going to dwindle if the news of their blatant extortion starts spreading worldwide. This is so flawed. Why would the private sector fund research into developing specific crop variants if the government does not protect their rights. 

&#x200B;

Public memory is very short. After independence, our farmers were not able to grow enough food for Indian consumption itself. India is able to feed its population today because of the green revolution that happened because of public funded research. All the benefits of the rise in productivity have been taken by the farmers without paying the people whose research caused the rise in productivity.   


Now when the private sector has invested billions in research to come up with better scientific tools to increase productive yield and desired characteristics in crops, the farmers want to take these benefits for free as well? 

&#x200B;

These farmers had contracted with Pepsi for growing specific potatoes for Lays chips. After the contract ended, the farmers were free to grow the regular potatoes they were growing earlier, no one forced them to grow Lays' proprietary version. Out of their greed, the farmers are surreptitiously growing Pepsi's version, which they will undoubtedly sell to Haldiram or other competitors, thus nullifying Pepsi's advantage and huge R&D investment.

&#x200B;

If this sets any precedent, Pepsi will either:

1) take over land for farming themselves, in friendly jurisdictions, or

2) make genetic modifications to the potatoes so they are sterile in the next generation

&#x200B;

In no way is this a victory for the greedy farmers, for the larger public, for innovation or for private sector investments into science. Thank you Nehru I am kinda on fence on this, while I support the farmers, i wish this went to court. A judgement regarding this would have clarified the legal stance on this. This would have set a precedent for future suits like this. Just because its election time and backing down due to ""political pressure"" and bad PR is not a victory in anyway. Why do they even need potatoes, that bag contains 90% Air, and 10% chips So does this mean the farmers can continue to grow the FC5 variety on their own?  That is such a loss of trade secret!  Anybody with expert views on the issue? Political pressure,my foot. Pehle to Pepsico ki chori pakdi gayi and the farmers have an airtight case. Gormint free mein credit le rahi hai. 

It's more likely that Pepsico struck a deal with NoMo for future crony capitalism. NoMo ""care "" for farmers is well-known. >“After discussions with the government, the company has agreed to withdraw the cases against the farmers,” a PepsiCo India spokesman said on Thursday, adding that this applied to all nine.

We Indians are often blinded by patriotism and nationalism that we sometimes fail to see that the government could be lying to us. Also, most of Indian mainstream media have failed us miserably.

Cobrapost stings 36 Bollywood celebrities in ‘Operation Karaoke’: It claims the celebrities are willing to post messages on their social media accounts on behalf of political parties in the guise of being their personal opinions—all in exchange for money.,1040,as91rq,https://www.newslaundry.com/2019/02/19/cobrapost-stings-36-bollywood-celebrities-in-operation-karaoke,256,,thetigermuff," Genuinely impressed that Sonu Sood thinks his tweets are worth 20 crores. 'The video also shows Abhijeet refusing to criticise West Bengal and the Trinamool Congress. “Usmein naam kyon loon (Why should I name them),” he is seen asking. He continues: “Nahi nahi, wo nahi kar sakta sirf Bengal aur TMC chhod ke sab karoonga … humara rozi-roti maximum wahan se hai (No, no. I can’t do that. I will do everything except Bengal and TMC … I earn my bread and butter maximum from there only).”'

LMAO > Arshad Warsi, Vidya Balan, Raza Murad and Saumya Tandon

Respect!  This is awesome. Expose the scummy entertainment industry. Have beens,Never beens and wannabes Everybody has their own price:

Sunny Leonne allegedly says in “Operation Karaoke” that she would support the BJP if her husband Daniel is given citizen status: “Modi Sir ne Daniel ko overseas citizen banaya toh hum zaroor support karenge (We will definitely support provided Modi Sir grants Daniel overseas citizen status).” Unfortunately, most people are not smart enough to handle social media. That's why Facebook and Twitter is destroying the world right now, be it in India or USA or UK.  # Look   at V.I.P comedian with 400 followers was also asking for money .LOL > “Last time bhi aise hua tha mujhe hire kiya tha Rajnath ji ne pata hai (Last time around the same had happened. I was hired by Rajnath ji, you know).”

>  “Haan wo bolna allowed nahi hota main aap logon ko bataa rahi hoon waise kyonki ye sab illegal hai toh hum matlab bol hee nahi sakte artist bol hee nahi sakte (Yes. Although it is not allowed to tell about it, I am still telling you because this all is illegal as artists cannot talk like this).”

Abe Rakhi toh troll kar rahe hai 😂 Just want to point out two things that people are overlooking in order to justify the misdeeds. 

It would have been fine if someone like Anupam Kher, Paresh Rawal or Akshay Kumar tweeted in favor of the party because they're either officially affiliated with the party or stand by its ideology. But if you've watched the video, the reporters state that the celebrities aren't officially backed by the party. This means that they are very clear about using the celebrities' social media accounts to mislead people into believing that the opinions are not fabricated or paid for. When a celebrity endorses a product, you know that there is a contract in between the two parties. But this is an intentional attempt at hiding that contract.

Also, since this hasn't been a point of discussion in comments, each one of them agreed to accept payment in the form of black money.  where do i watch interactions of the peeps who refused? Although Vivek Oberoi is a chutiya, he does that that he will only post if it is backed by data (truth). Does make him a bit better of the lot IMO. Hindustan mein jub tak saneema hai log chutiya banthe rahenge!  In other news, water is wet I love the irony of Shakti Kapur supporting notebandi and then asking for kala dhan. 

Is there anyone left after this that actually believes notebandi had anything do with ending black money?
 Feeling bad for Rs. 2/tweet IT cell workers. It's time to ask for a raise!  Also shows how the celebs try to distance themselves from this sort of thing.

&#x200B;

The whole ""influencer"" culture is cancer. Opened up the vulnerable people to a whole lot of scummy tactics by the ""MBA - sales and marketing"" types.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Amish Patel ne bachpan barbaad kar diya bc

A thing to observe is that they went after the small fish. I think the big fish won't be stupid enough to fall for something like this (or probably had smart people managing this sort of stuff for them). the way Mahima Chaudhary just said yes to their propositions which should've sounded suspicious from my perspective was super-stupid if you're committing an illegal or possibly defaming act. Inko to sahi mein kaala ""dhan"" ka lalach hain BC 😂 Add Phogat sisters and Yogeshwar Dutt to the list. Their tweets make it clear they are on BJP's payroll.  Well done  Celebrity life is in tight state yo. Most of them are out of jobs in the mainstrem movies. They don't wanna end up like A.K Hangal in their final days. Poor, miserable and no one to look after. And Bollywood has done that to most of the yesteryear stars and supporting actors. What's the point of gaining lakhs of followers - with your personal &/or suggestive photos - if you cannot monetize it ? All B and C grade actors, lol they got the actor who played drona in Maha bharat in 1980s. Ofcourse if you offer them 3-4 lakh for a tweet they'll accept.

Try doing it with top A list actors.  Amazing and very brave. A long suspected but never proven before social media trend. 

Next target should be the 24 hour television news and Hindi newspapers in north India who are being used by Modiji as a personal mouthpiece.

A miniscule proportion of Indian "" journalists"" actually doing journalism. Especially in an environment where even facebook posts against the government can land you in jail. Or posts against powerful businesses like Reliance can make them threaten court cases.

Remove Sedition and Defamation laws in India. They belong in the 19th century. Can't open the link, who are these celebrities? Sunny Leone is the only one who seems logical. She wants citizenship for her husband. The whole deal is fucked up but just saying she's basically talking quid pro quo. Celebs were advertising political parties even before the internet came around. I don't find anything wrong with that. It's their job to put their faces on things and advertise. 

But kudos to Cobrapost to make the effort to bring this to the front.  So, if I become a millionaire. I literally have a chance dating bollywood actress. 

I always knew that, it’s possible. 

I am really not at all surprised. 

Ameesha patel and minisha lamba - jobless lol. 

Rajpal yadav - Last time I heard about him, he was already bankrupt.  >According to what plays out in “Operation Karaoke”, actors purportedly went on to refer other actors—and in some cases, even family members—whom they thought would be suitable for the gig. For example, actor Surendra Pal—best known for his role as Dronacharya in Mahabharat—put Cobrapost’s undercover reporters in touch with Puneet Issar and Upasana Singh. 

Dronachayra ensuring Duryodhan gets his due. Mahaaabhaaaraaaat! Katha hai ye swarth ki. Celebrity endorsing political party since ages , there is no doubt every A Lister in 70-90's was Congress puppet 
Now they have shifted more towards BJP . It's us who has become moar zhutiya that we believe them 
 Hahaha. Khul gayi. Conviently doesn't ask anyone to promote political agenda of Congress and the left. Only AAP takes a beating. Idgaf about the celebrities, it's better if they're exposed as the hypocrites they are. But technically isn't this a bit like entrapment? # Imagine how much Sonu Nigam has earned till now. Strange how this one government brought the entire country to its knees, it's crazy! Anyone know why they are talking about September ? Was this shot since last year ? E-tier celebrities will do anything for money

this is brand new information It's called Public Relations lobbying I.e. illegal. This shows the possibility that the previous supports by the celebs could have been paid. Let's see how bhakts will argue even after this 😂 In other news, water is wet. Where to apply for this cash for tweet, asking for friend Here' [Ashish Nehra](https://youtu.be/m489zSRnkIk) mentioning about these operations.

Skip to 2:45. Sonu Sood 😂😂 I don't understand why cobrapost had to go to these celebrities and ask about posting for BJP they could have offered money from the side of Congress and then check if they were willing to accept money from Congress or not! It's a shame that the news will not reach the mass it is supposed to. No one in mainstream media is talking about this, even on YouTube the average views on each of the video are about 15k only.  If you follow cricket Ashish Nehra talks about this on an episode of Breakfast With Champions. I don't see a need for sensationalizing sting operation here. The Sunny Leone video seemed fine. She mentioned she posts what she believes in. And they (she and her husband) seemed to indicate they'll post stuff that fits issues that she'd be close to. Plus the cobrapost guys kept saying they'll give her legit content to post. Not sure why anyone would have a problem with posting (what they are being told will be) facts Did anyone of them go against the BJP? Quite a revealing sting tbh, especially showing the deep Web of black money that exists in the Indian entertainment industry  Great, just great! Why are people surprised or angry at this? The actors job is to convince people of something they are not.
And if you look up to the actors for political opinions then the problem lies with you. Interesting how most of the bunch are not as successful as their counterparts. This explains why BJP has been getting so much Bollywood support. All the Rafale money is being spent here. What’s the big deal here? Celebrities have been exchanging endorsements for cash since time immemorial.

But it is any other political ad nonetheless, and well before campaigning has to end. So yeah, it is fine, no. [deleted] >is that even allowed?   

what , & why ? Yes it's allowed. Newspapers allow advertisers to insert ads like this and given it's political season you can do political ads via these inserts. It's a loss of revenue for the paper because this ad could have gone on the paper but they tend to look the other way as it's revenue for their distributors, who they rely on. Highest GDP rate under UPA rule is shown 8.1% according to the picture, but isn't it supposed to be [10.68%](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/india-clocked-10-08-pc-growth-under-manmohan-singhs-tenure-shows-data/articleshow/65444247.cms)?

Pamphlets are 100% allowed for campaigning and there is no dissing of the opposition party here except making a comparison. The only person you should complain to is your newspaper delivery fellow.

Good job Congress.

OP, that candidate is a good guy. Vote for him. Have you ever opened a ToI newspaper? If you're lucky, you'll find some news among the Modi ads. I never knew 'cable Tv rates' were a point of contention in these elections. Yes its allowed, its an Advert... which are allowed till a notified day before poll begins in a constituency.

Also, everything stated in the ad, most of it is true... Choose wisely and when we support communal people, they remain busy in polarization, development gets lost just like in last 5 years. Observe that this person is asking to vote his party (contesting at a local level) based on stats at the national level.

It, to some extent, shows the mindset of most of the people: They care more that who will win at the national level rather than at local level.

Ironically, if something goes bad in their constituency then their local MLA or MP is more likely to be accountable rather than people at the national level. I don't see why it isn't.

1. Demonetisation, Congress had a wonderful opportunity to destroy BJP in the mind of common people, yet try as they might, BJP Propaganda was able to beat Congress arguments and Congress were able to do nothing.
2. Farmer Suicide, Congress again was able to not convince the majority that BJP is the cause of this and as such was not able to rally support
3. BJP was able to successfully weaken all institutions in our country and place their men in charge, while congress just sat and watched
4. Mishandling of Kashmir done by BJP as Terrorism rose by more than 200% and yet, congress did not even think of using this issue against BJP
5. Asifa Bano Case, A Horrendous where a 8 year old was raped by BJP Officials and what Congress Did, nothing, Hell they even allowed BJP to manipulate the issue into a Hindu vs Muslim issue and they did nothing for it
6. Rafale deal, Congress tried their level best to accuse BJP of Corruption, yet nothing happened, infact they spent way too much time on Rafale Deal that even the Country forgot about them

Congress is dragged down by the Gandhi Family, especially Rahul Gandhi, who really give waste Congress, Ask yourselves this, If Amit Shah was Congress President, he would have a Field Day against BJP in these issues, but these morons successfully turn a favourable situation into a unfavourable one. In fact, In both Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh, where BJP had Anti Incumbency against them, Congress still did not do as well as they could have. In Karnataka, BJP was just seats away from forming Government, due to Congress's own mismanagement in campaigning

TLDR - If Congress and BJP were Human Being and You Gave congress a Gun with six bullets and told him to shoot at BJP, he will Miss the first 5 shots and shot himself at the 6th shot, That's how incompetent Congress's right now, This Election for them is a Lost cause, they should start planning for 2024 elections",Stardust00000," I think you are underestimating the power of money. 

[Ruling BJP got 95% of funds from electoral bonds ](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/ruling-bjp-bags-95-of-funds-why-there-s-an-uproar-over-electoral-bonds-119040500309_1.html)

>  ADR's report shows of the Rs 215 crore generated through the banking instruments in 2017-18, the ruling party secured Rs 210 crore and the opposition Congress Rs 5 crore.

[BJP is richest national party with ₹1,034 crore income: ADR ](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-is-richest-national-party-with-1034-crore-income-adr/article23493239.ece)

>  Seven national parties declared a total income of ₹1,559.17 crore in 2016-17, with BJP having the highest — ₹1,034.27 crore. This forms 66.34% of the total income of national parties added together during 2016-17. The Indian National Congress followed with ₹225.36 crore — 14.45% of the total income.

It is this money which oils the propaganda machine of the Bharatiya Janta Party. The BJP simply owns the media. They push their narratve online through social media and offline through television. The Prime Minister spreads his propaganda through the Radio. The only channel they haven't occupied is the newspaper. However social media helps the BJP connect to the youth while the radio helps it connect with the rural hinterlands in a way the newspaper cannot match. The television appeals to the urban population.

1. Since the media and narrative is owned, it was difficult to realise the ill effects of this move and it took about a yr for the full futility and stupidity of the move to reveal itself; by which time the people had moved on. They did raise the issue at the time though.

2. It was agrarian problems and Congress capitalization on them that helped Congress improve its seat tally in the Gujarat state elections and win the states of Rajasthan, MP and Chattisgarh recently. 

3. Indians dont care about Institutions. The common man doesn't understand these issues. I agree they could've highlighted this, but tell me honestly, in your daily life how many people do you know who would sit and discuss this with you ? Most people I know don't understand the importance of institutions and dont want to either. They simply dont care. In rural areas it'll be worse.

4. To be honest, I think Indians are happy with the way the Govt has handled the Kashmir issue. In their minds Kashmiris are terrorists. I've seen soo many arguments that India gives Kashmir more money than it earns in taxes, build roads and bridges and schools and gets stone throwers and terrorists in returns. Remember that, atleast on online media, how Indians agreed with and cheered Gogoi chaining a civilian to his jeep ? A civilian who was simply participating in Indian Democracy ? It's sad really, the hatred. 

5. I don't know if rape cases should be politicized. Also don't know much about this to comment on how BJP can be held accountable.

6. I think they were trying to attack BJP ""clean image"".


Instead of ranting that Congress could've handled it better, you should try exploring what it could've done better. I think they are trying, but the narrative is not in their favour and with the media in the state it is, any criticism of the Government is just termed fake news and ignored. It's difficult to get your point across. Moreover BJP is dealing solely in rhetoric and not facts, which just becomes a battle of charisma and playing/preying on emotions, something BJP and Modi/Shah are well experienced in. It also doesn't help that Indians are easily swayed with emotions and grand visions of a glorious past and glorious future.

Could they have done better ? Probably. But its difficult to criticize them without providing alternatives. 

Edit- The BJP alone commands a majority in the lower house. This has allowed it to pass bills such as the Aadhar Bill and the electoral bond bill as money bills thereby escaping the scrutiny of the Rajya Sabha where the opposition could have raised objections. The power to decide if a bill is a money bill lies solely with the Speaker of the House. Well I think you're grossly missing some significant points here.

Congress is not a strong opposition because they don't even have enough strength to form a strong opposition. 

Remember GST? It was because of Congress pulling the strings that they could make it a constitutional bill so that it can at least be debated upon in the upper house. If BJP had been successful in making it a money bill and passing it in the lower house, it would have been an even bigger debacle than it is now, considering some of the brazen loopholes they had deliberately left. How do I say this? Electoral bonds, right there. Passed as a money bill with absolutely no debate on it.

Congress has played their role to the best of their capacity in playing the opposition. If anything, we have to blame ourselves for voting a narcissist fascist into power.

And then you have Godi Media. How do we as common people even get to know if the opposition is working? Through media. You see what I'm getting at?

When you're accusing Congress to be pathetic, please stand back and think if there is a reason if they are so. I agree they could have done a lot more from a campaign point of view but to categorically say they did not do anything is extremely naive.

So to modify your analogy, if Congress and BJP were two humans, then Congress was given an old pistol with 6 pellets and a moving obstacle (media) in between while BJP was given a bulletproof jacket. Congress took shots, missed a couple, was blocked by the obstacle but still managed to hit BJP on its head when it mattered. You forget how bigoted the people in this country are. Worst of all are the ""educated middle class"" folk.  Can you tell me what Congress could have done for the first five issues.  

I have seen statements about the first 5 issues. 

For Rafale, I agree with you it could have been overplayed. 

 Liked the way you sarcastically shamed bjp. Will be forwarding to my bjp friends Another Congress bashing post with no real substance behind it.

> Congress has done literally nothing to combat BJP

- Congress was instrumental in ensuring that Modi *kaka* could not rewrite the landmark UPA legislation on land rights that prevented the government from outright stealing our land for pennies and giving it to the rich corporates.(Remember *suit-boot ki sarkar*?)

- Congress effectively ensured that dilution to the RTI act was prevented.

- Congress effectively ensured that the Citizen Amendment Bill (and many other idiotic and / or dangerous bills were not passed). 

- The Congress effectively highlighted the scams including Demonetisation and Rafale.

**There oppposition has been quite effective and because of that they've already regained a lot of the vote share they lost in 2014, back in Gujarat, MP, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh.**

-----

> Demonetisation, Congress had a wonderful opportunity to destroy BJP in the mind of common people, yet try as they might, BJP Propaganda was able to beat Congress arguments and Congress were able to do nothing.

You must be really ignorant to believe that. Dr. Manmohan Singh went on record how it would wipe away nearly 2% of the GDP, and all the media reported on its accuracy after 6-12 months. Rahul Gandhi has consistently highlighted how Demonetisation has been a total failure. 

In fact, **it was precisely because of their effective political campaign against Demonetisation (among other issues) that the opposition won a lot of the bypolls, and the Congress went on to win 3 states.**

> Farmer Suicide, Congress again was able to not convince the majority that BJP is the cause of this and as such was not able to rally support

**What bullshit.** Successful highlighting and campaigning of Modi government's anti-farmer policies were instrumental in ensuring the electoral defeat of the BJP in many seats.

> BJP was able to successfully weaken all institutions in our country and place their men in charge, while congress just sat and watched

**And you know about this because of the congress campaigns.** Obviously they can't do much more about it as the government in power has all the rights to legally appoint whomever they want and to tweak policies to support their agenda. **Where the BJP tried to change the laws to further subvert any institutions, the Congress effectively mobilised the opposition and stopped it.**

> Mishandling of Kashmir done by BJP as Terrorism rose by more than 200% and yet, congress did not even think of using this issue against BJP

They have repeatedly highlighted how when they left power, Kashmir was safer, and how tourism had increased due to effective security and action against the terrorists.

> Asifa Bano Case, A Horrendous where a 8 year old was raped by BJP Officials and what Congress Did, nothing, Hell they even allowed BJP to manipulate the issue into a Hindu vs Muslim issue and they did nothing for it

Again, the fact that you know about it speaks volume. Sometimes it is best to work in the background and not politicise everything to ensure justice is done and the truth revealed. 

> Rafale deal, Congress tried their level best to accuse BJP of Corruption, yet nothing happened, infact they spent way too much time on Rafale Deal that even the Country forgot about them

**Are you just pretending to be dumb?** It is because of Congress and Rahul Gandhi's effective campaign on Rafale that **Modi *kaka* had to go on the defensive and launch a new campaign (*Mein Bhi Chowkidar*) to counter the charges of corruption.**

>  In both Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh, where BJP had Anti Incumbency against them, Congress still did not do as well as they could have. 

**And in all 3 states the Congress is in power now. And yet you want to nitpick on the margin of victories out of pure malice and nothing else.**
 I would just like to say one thing : Do you think you are being deluded by the media? The media sure portrays (even NDTV) modi as invulnerable, but just check how many protests there have been against modi in last 6 months , the media didn't showed them at all, and how many cases can NDTV show in a small time bracket crowded with ads.

Then there is matter of vote share, with all the fresh lies and hate for congress BJP made 30% vote share, even in bestest case scenario it won't be more than 25% in 2019, with congress 23-26 it's hard for the massive coalition called NDA.  The thing is, Congress has done so much shit in their time, they don't have guts to speaks neither a face to accuse current Government of misdeeds as they have been worse than that.

Plus, BJP has been smart with intimidating prominent Congress leaders with legal actions & raids. For example, In Maharashtra, NCP is strong party and could have played better opposition role, but intimidation of legal actions against Ajit Pawar (nephew of Sharad Pawar) over his irrigation scams, they were successful at keeping him shut. Same goes with Chidambarm...So you see, in every state BJP targeted someone hence a voiceless opposition.

All in all, Our Democracy has been in complete shamble. BJP has not done much even in sanitation and electrification, UPA's record in electrification was comparable if not better than BJP. Just saw today's morning fix episode. Great points. Despite losing miserably with only **44 seats in 2014**, INC is still led by Gandhis. There should've been at least some overhaul in the leadership, just like what BJP did post-2009. I understand Nehruji did a lot for our nation but *gandhi bhakti* should have some limit. Underlines my belief that a democracy is only as good as the opposition is.

 #the only problem with Congress is Gandhi family. 


 Sab mile hue hai ji  

Jokes apart, I heard a rumour which is rife in the political circles. That Congress is intentionally putting up a shitshow and refusing to share seats with allies even in states where it's weak because it desperately wants RahulBaba to become PM in 2024, after anti-incumbency factor against BJP kicks in.

It knows that this year if it makes deals with allies and somehow the UPA manages to get a comfortable number of seats, enough to form a coalition government, allies like CBN, Mamta, Mayawati, Kejri and others will not let RahulBaba become PM. Hence it is in a way conceding defeat, with asshole planning.

So, in a way we are fucked with BJP, without BJP, with absolute gutter assholes at the helm of the two biggest parties.  So much fake claims, it's okay I guess.  [2.Farmers](https://2.Farmers) suicide \~ Happened a lot in Congress rule. Still happening in Congress rued states like Punjab/Karnataka etc.

6.There is no money trail on rafale deal..Also Congress leaders like Rahul/Sonia are out on bail in NH scam..now Chidambaram is under ED scanner...Augusta westland also coming out..there are shady land dealings within Gandhi family so they crying hoarse about others corruption wont cut with general populace. Your post is complete **bullshit**.

Just look at results of last year's election in 5 states. You'll know people are more intelligent then you think them to be. Demonetisation, Kashmir handling etc failure doesn't require any preaching, their failure were out in the open and common people know how they suffered. 

Congress did whatever they can do but it's hard to put their work out in the open when ruling party has bought all the media!



and BJP did good work in Sanitation, electrification?? You're out of touch with reality. Stop watching Republic or Zee TV and look at some concrete facts.  Congress defeated bjp in 3 states at a go. Other states like punjab and karnataka they formed government. Congress Gujarat elections performance were the its best in more than a decade. Most of states were bjp has won major factor was anti incumbency and jumla baaji. 
First do some analysis and then post. U are being fed propoganda on daily basis and it has reduced ur analytical ability to near zero. 
31% was modi G vote share. He benefited mainly due to fragmented opposition votes. This is not going to repeat this time. Unpopular opinion: As much as I hate to say it, BJP is going to win by a landslide again, simply because there is no visible opposition to them. 

Pappu is an undeserving chutiya and even though I hate Modi, I don't want that dumbfuck to be the Prime Minister. 

Congress needs a massive overhaul in management. Pappu needs to take a backseat. Their party needs to come first. They need a charismatic leader with proven credentials. Sadly they don't have any of these. 

The only way they could've had any hope is if they had formed an alliance with AAP and fielded Arvind Kejriwal as their PM candidate however this would've been too big of a sacrifice for their dynasty. 

For BJP, according to their own words, party comes before self. Sadly that isn't true for Congress - the Gandhi family comes before everything else. Till this stays true, they have no hope because their scion is just that big of a retard. 

Koi nahi. Ek term saha hai, ek aur seh lenge. We have to trust the process and we have to trust the Constitution. We have to trust the intentions of our founding fathers, and we have to believe that no matter what happens, the sanctity of our democracy won't be compromised over the next 5 years. 

Apna time ayega.  Man my exact thoughts. Congress lacks good leadership, even the farmer issue that could have been a great issue to combat BJP on. Yet, Congress does shit. Ngl, the manifesto is good but I don't have any faith that Congress would be able to implement it.  This is like a family friend yelling that ""the doctor is not doing enough for rising awareness"" at a patient who has cancer and is ignoring it because ""if not cancer then what""

On the day of the incident, there was zero help provided by the police or the politicians until the hospital became an actual battlefield and the boys hostel burned. Heck even the girl hostels were surrounded and were threatened with rape. There was no entry or exit. 


Heck the WB govt. only measly excuse of support  after the incident had taken place and the the doctors had been on strike for a couple of hours.


Imagine being an eighteen year old kid having high hopes and aspirations of becoming a doctor and helping people. Then this happens, suddenly it becomes clear why a majority of doctors leave India as soon as they complete their education. Attack on doctors in WB is part of a toxic ""culture"" of destruction of public property and beating the officials prevalent here for a long time. Not only the doctors but policemen, teachers, government officials, forest guards and most commonly the staff of the electricity department are often attacked here. The government usually doesn't take much action against those hooligans.

What we need here is rule of law. Punish these miscreants heard and those idiots would not dare to do it again. ####700 Doctors have quit in Bengal now

Gandhi was popularized by it. But it was not non violence that drove the British away. It was the bankruptcy and a threat of rebellion. Why don't central govt deploy CISF to safeguard hospitals...

This issue of doctors under threat isn't specific to a state, it's a pan India issue...


And CISF is a force raised with mandate to safeguard assets of India...


But, what is central govt doing...

[removed] People like him and sadhvi pragya get garlanded and our officers get beaten up! This indian politics is really a ""chutiyapanti ka khazana"" Welcome to goondaraj We can comment and make jokes on this all we want but there is no one who will take action against this. Civil Society in India is a joke. Kaha milega itna content? If a terror accused can reach in Parliament, why would anyone suprise garlanding a political leader for beating up a public servant. Indian mind works on herd mentality or in subtle term : momentum. That is why mob culture is so prevalent. If we see others are doing a particular thing without facing any repercussion, most will follow to do the same.

Presently, BJP has infiltrated the minds of people through ingenious use of Social media mainly Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter in that order. They always hammer the fact through various fake news, misrepresentation that supreme leader working for people and the opposition is trying to prevent him from doing so. There is nothing to stop this. People are too lazy to use their rational thinking. Moreover, some people will happily believe what his cousin forwarded in the Whatsapp rather than what is published in The Hindu/NDTV. In this case also, Whatsapp message must have shown how this youngstar has fought with a corrupt official with his bat. 

Until a significant event happens that can shake up the status quo, people will only go along the route shown by BJP. Like what Anna Hazare did with UPA2 (influenced also by the Nirbhaya case which kind of shake the people), Opposition needs some big thing to play. 

But the key is not to attack the Govt. blindly. It is to state that people are suffering from Govt. corruption/inadequacies. People do not care if BJP is more rich than Congress. They only care what is happening with their life. Presently, Congress/Opposition is not in a position to establish that BJP is getting rich at the cost of people. Just saying Rafael is a big corruption or Chowkidar Chor hai will not do. I wouldn't be all that shocked if that official who was hit too garlanded him LOL. Servility is limitless in our society. Vow! Garland the criminals, rapists, mob lynchers, murderers!!

The fascism guffaws at its forward march!

State power (And also its managers, administrators, political managers, who are rewarded through promotions, money, posts, petrol pumps, etc; and a ""reactionary"" section of the mass) follows the diktats of fascism meekly and voluntarily.

Fascism is not above and different than capitalism, but it's own another form, like state capitalism or crony capitalism.

Fascism cannot be defeated without demolishing capitalism, the mother of all evils! Congratulations! You have passed level-5.. Fearless and so power comes from top level. Guys don't troll him otherwise you will be called as a anti national. This is unacceptable. We, as a society, cannot distinguish between right and wrong. I hope he gets punished for what he did.

"Free India’s first terrorist was Hindu, his name was Godse: Kamal Haasan",489,bnzfpt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/indias-first-terrorist-was-hindu-says-kamal-haasan/article27114060.ece,324,,averroesthemoor," Whether Nathuram Godse was India’s first terrorist or fourth terrorist is irrelevant. The disturbing issue is that there are senior leaders in mainstream Indian politics who think that he was not a terrorist/extremist & proclaim that belief proudly. Terrorism has no religion. But if its okay to say muslim terrorist then there is nothing wrong with this statement. Wow so many closet godse apologists here. Like there are so many circumstances that turned godse into a terrorist, but if it's an act done by people from other religion this argument doesn't holds. Damn, he called out just one terrorist and look at all the terrorist sympathizers parading to show their adherence. IMO There is nothing wrong in identifying terrorism by religion.

When a Muslim is involved, call it Islamic terrorism. When a Hindu is involved, call it Hindu terrorism. I think people need to understand here that 'Hindu Terrorist' and 'Terrorist who is Hindu' are 2 different things.

Even if we consider the thought that terrorism has no religion, terrorist follow certain religion. Terrorism can have different faces other than religion. It can be ego, grudges or personal biases. But unfortunately we name terrorism only when religion is involved.

To keep peace, we must keep religion outside the thought of identifying terrorists.

So when extremists from Hindu religion claim that the people from another religion are terrorists, they must think of the fact that someone who acted as a terrorist in free India followed Hindu religion. And it is a fact that it was a proper plan to kill Gandhi after few failed attempts followed by open threats and. So, it was an act terrorism.

&#x200B;

I have tried to keep this argument neutral. There can be flaws in my argument and I would like explore the thoughts. Counter arguments are welcomed. To the people who are saying that Godse was a political assassin and not a terrorist. According to me a person that wages war on the nation with aim to destroy its structure is a terrorist.

If someone assassinated the prime minister today he would be considered a terrorist. And this guy killed the ""Father of the Nation"",who is leagues above a prime minister, and that I consider an act of terrorism that was aimed to destroy the structure of secular India. Finally someone has the balls to say it. Kamal Haasan always sayin it how it is Fucking true. The worst thing is I've seen plenty of people actually thinking what he did was right. True words. Mahatma Gandhi was against the idea and belief of the Sanghis. MG wanted to demolish the caste system and RSS wants that Caste system should be restored.

Godse was bhakt of RSS & he killed MG. He has expressed an understanding of the motivation of Godse and the hidden force behind the assassination in his film '[Hey Ram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Ram)' Godse means a lot more to the RSS and Hindutva terrorism champions than Gandhi ever meant to anybody. Hindu terrorists are more dangerous and toxic than Muslim ones. World knows when muslim terrorists does it. Hindus are two faced ones and hide behind Government and Hindus themselves can't separate themselves from it due to customs and traditions.

Islam terrorists spread Terror across Europe and America. Hindu terrorists spread terror inside their own land. [removed] What point is he trying to make? I am, unfortunately, ignorant regarding Indian history. [removed] Calling Godse India's first terrorist is a ignorant statement. Godse was a terrorist but he was a result of the direct day riots.

The pre-independence events need to be taken into account to understand the complex reality of religious terrorism today. India was born out of blood make no mistake, the horrors of partition are well documented. If today, we had riots of that scale, we would have thousands of Godse's running around. I don't agree with Hassan's comments. Godse didn't kill Gandhi to terrorise any one, so not terrorism, he did for for political and religious reasons, so an assassination. It's an etymological mistake that anyone could have made, but the blowback would be disproportional to the mistake, I am guessing.

Edit: yeah, I'm wrong. JFK was assassinated because some crazy guy didn't like him while Gandhi was assassinated to scare people away from protecting minorities.

I will keep the original comments up so that people could see how the argument went. I realise my Kashmir comment is also unpopular. I stand by that. Hindu terrorists actually makes sense. Usually terrorists, in 99.999% cases, are always Muslims. Whenever we feel need to make distinction we say Hindu terrorist. 

Saying Muslim terrorist or islamic terrorist makes it superfluous or redundant. What about those who killed millions in the name of religion during/after partition? They were saint or freedom fighter? No, it didn't start with Godse. I disagree with KH. 

Godse is most talked about because he assassinated MKG. Godse didn't target a community in the name of religion. If Godse is terrorist, then JFK's or Jamal Khashoggi's murderers also terrorist. Are CIA, KGB, RAW or ISI terrorist organization? [removed] [removed] Godse was a Assassin. The incident is known as Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The statements by Hasan is just incorrect. 

Assassin 

A person who murders an important person for political or religious reasons. 

Terrorist

A person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. Killing one person makes you killer not terrorist.. Terrorist kill unrelated people to make a statement. That was not a terrorist attack that was plain simple murder. I am not justfying anything they are both henious crimes. I do believe in Hindutva terrorism but that was an assassination and can't be called terrorism by any stretch. But why is Godse termed a terrorist and not a murderer?
How was Godse assassinating Gandhi an act of terrorism?

Don’t think this is new, this is the exact pattern every lynching/attack on Muslims and Dalits has proceeded. 

Remember the gurgaon family that got beaten up? An FIR was filed on them. 

https://amp.scroll.in/article/918410/new-justice-of-new-india-the-mob-attack-on-gurugram-muslim-family-follows-a-sickening-pattern

From that article

> It is a sickeningly familiar pattern. In almost every case of hate crime and lynching the Karwan e Mohabbat has followed, the police have registered complaints against the victims, charging them with cow slaughter, animal cruelty, violence, even rash driving. The victims are often jailed. So, instead of fighting for justice against their attackers, they become preoccupied with marshalling their own defence. In time, the police or village elders broker an out-of-court “compromise”: the victim will claim not to recognise their attackers and in return the police will not pursue the criminal cases against them.

The family had to leave their house and move to a different village at the end. 

Pehlu Khan’s death was not the end of his family’s misery. It’s only the beginning. What I said in the other thread.

>Chutiyatic move by a moronic government. However much you suck up to Hindutva, the bhakts are never going to vote for you. They have a bhakter alternative.

>So grow a spine and uphold the values you claim to espouse idiots. Next, he will be arrested for making people lynch him. **Update 1**: ***This is poor reporting as Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot himself has clarified that Pehlu Khan has not been charge-sheeted.*** [‘Pehlu Khan’s name not in charge sheet submitted by cops,’ says Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/newsindia/pehlu-khans-name-not-in-charge-sheet-submitted-by-cops-says-rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot/ar-AADBLG1).

**Update 2**: The Rajasthan Congress CM also clarified that the police probe against the victim's family had been ordered by the former BJP government. [Alwar lynching: ‘Probe carried out by BJP govt,’ says Gehlot](https://www.asianage.com/india/politics/290619/alwar-lynching-probe-carried-out-by-bjp-govt-says-gehlot.html).

> **The Chief Minister assured that the accused will not be spared**. *""Accused must be taught a lesson so that no one commits such crime in the future,""* Gehlot added.

--------

The issue is that these laws exists and if they exist then the police have no choice but to apply it, especially if it is brought to their attention or they are ordered to ""investigate"" under these law.

There is no ""soft / hard"" *hindutva* here. Remember that the accused have the political backing of the RSS / BJP. The supporters of the accused claim that the victim was transporting cattle and thus they were ""justified"" in attacking him to save ""gowmatha"". 

And it could be very well true that the victim was transporting cattle for slaughter. Obviously that does not justify the violent attacks against him. But if it is true, the police unfortunately have no choice but to file an FIR and investigate this matter too because of the laws:

> The chargesheet accuses Khan and his sons under sections 5, 8 and 9 of the Rajasthan Bovine Animal (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 1995 and Rules, 1995.

> ... *“After complete investigation in the matter, offences under section 5, 8, 9 RBA Act has been proved against accused Irshad, Aarif and Pehlu Khan while offences under Section 6 RBA Act has been proved against accused Khan Mohammed,”* states the current chargesheet filed against FIR number 253/17 of Behror police station, Alwar.

> ... Section 5 of the Rajasthan Bovine Animal (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 1995 and Rules, 1995 pertains to prohibition of the export of bovine animals for the purpose of slaughter and regulation of temporary migration or export for other purposes.

> According to Section 6, the transporter is also an abettor and is liable for the same punishment as the person committing the offence. Section 8 is about the penalty for such offences while Section 9 mentions punishment for causing hurt to a bovine animal.

Also note that just because the police believes there is a case, doesn't mean the accused are guilty - a court determines that. Muslims should never place their faith in Congress. Congress has always betrayed Muslims. 

Ask those numerous innocent Muslim youth who were in jail for many many years in fake terrorism charges arrested during Congress governments. 

Read the report ""Torture"" - Indian  State’s  Instrument  of Control  in  Indian  administered Jammu  and Kashmir by Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons(APDP) And JammuKashmirCoalitionofCivilSociety(JKCCS) to know how the Kashmiris were tourtured in the most inhumane and unimaginable ways during the Congress governments.

There are many many many examples.. How is the cow which was involved in the incident ? Congress is truly a B - Team of RSS. They may not actively kill Muslims, but they will protect those who kill them. The ground reality in India is sickening. People who espouse secular values, and I am referring to the INC here, are as casteist and communal as the openly communal sangh based groups. Political parties are catering to the lowest common denominator of the society and encouraging behavior based on non-liberal, isolationist values. Unless we as Indians accept the reality of our wretched casteist existence change will not happen. All our so called education won't undo the harms which have led us to the current state. If we continue to do the same things which we have always done we shouldn't expect anything different to happen. This lynching squad should get most severe punishment under the law. But it doesn't free the victim from his crimes. /s Typical behavior of Congress and left parties. They used to  take votes from dalits and the stab dalits in the back.

I disagree with some specific parts of the article but overall it's great. (It's brutal on the opposition too) 

#[Can the World's Largest Democracy Endure Another Five Years of a Modi Government?](http://time.com/5586415/india-election-narendra-modi-2019/)

Here are short excepts from the article comparing 2014 and 2019 mood

> In 2014, Modi converted cultural anger into economic promise. He spoke of jobs and development. Taking a swipe at the socialist state, he famously said, “Government has no business being in business.” That election, though it is hard to believe now, was an election of hope. When the Delhi press tried to bait the Modi voter with questions about building a temple in Ayodhya, a place where Hindu nationalist mobs in 1992 had destroyed a 16th century mosque, said to stand at the birthplace of the Hindu epic hero Ram, they stoutly responded with: “Why are you talking to us of temples, when we are telling you that we’re voting for him because we want development.” Sabka saath, sabka vikas–“Together with all, development for all”–was Modi’s slogan in 2014.
> 
> As India votes this month, the irony of those words is not lost on anyone. Not only has Modi’s economic miracle failed to materialize, he has also helped create an atmosphere of poisonous religious nationalism in India. One of his young party men, Tejasvi Surya, put it baldly in a speech in March 2019, “If you are with Modi, you are with India. If you are not with Modi, then you are strengthening anti-India forces.” India’s Muslims, who make up some 14% of the population, have been subjected to episode after violent episode, in which Hindu mobs, often with what seems to be the state’s tacit support, have carried out a series of public lynchings in the name of the holy cow, that ready symbol of Hindu piety. Hardly a month goes by without the nation watching agog on their smartphones as yet another enraged Hindu mob falls upon a defenseless Muslim. The most enduring image of Modi’s tenure is the sight of Mohammad Naeem in a blood-soaked undershirt in 2017, eyes white and enlarged, begging the mob for his life before he is beaten to death. The response of leadership in every instance is the same: virtual silence. Basic norms and civility have been so completely vitiated that Modi can no longer control the direction of the violence. Once hatred has been sanctioned, it is not always easy to isolate its target, and what the BJP has discovered to its dismay is that the same people who are willing to attack Muslims are only too willing to attack lower-caste Hindus as well. The party cannot afford to lose the lower-caste vote, but one of the ugliest incidents occurred in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, in July 2016, when upper-caste men stripped four lower-caste tanners, paraded them in the streets and beat them with iron rods for allegedly skinning a cow.
> 
> If these contradictions are part of the unevenness of a society assimilating Western freedoms, it must be said that under Modi minorities of every stripe–from liberals and lower castes to Muslims and Christians–have come under assault. Far from his promise of development for all, he has achieved a state in which Indians are increasingly obsessed with their differences. If in 2014 he was able to exploit difference in order to create a climate of hope, in 2019 he is asking people to stave off their desperation by living for their differences alone. The incumbent may win again–the opposition, led by Rahul Gandhi, an unteachable mediocrity and a descendant of Nehru, is in disarray–but Modi will never again represent the myriad dreams and aspirations of 2014. Then he was a messiah, ushering in a future too bright to behold, one part Hindu renaissance, one part South Korea’s economic program. Now he is merely a politician who has failed to deliver, seeking re-election. Whatever else might be said about the election, hope is off the menu.


Anyway the story of the author Aatish Taseer's family is fascinating too. I just discovered it.

[His father is Pakistani Punjab governor, Salman Taseer who was assasinated by an Islamist fanatic for opposing Pakistani blashphemy laws and supporting Asia Bibi, a Christian accused and imprisoned for false blasphemy charges](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/05/pakistan-salman-taseer-liberal).  

His mother is Tavleen Singh, now a pro-Modi(but not pro-Yogi) columnist in the Indian Express. 


He himself is an author who has written half a dozen books, most recently ""The Twice-born""
 and a variety of columns in International and Indian newspapers. 

> Aatish Taseer has worked as a reporter for Time Magazine and has written for the Sunday Times, the Sunday Telegraph, the Financial Times, Prospect, TAR Magazine and Esquire. He is the author of Stranger to History: a Son's Journey through Islamic Lands (2009) and a highly acclaimed translation Manto: Selected Stories (2008). His novel, The Temple-Goers (2010) was shortlisted for the 2010 Costa First Novel Award. A second novel, Noon, is now available published by Picador (UK) and Faber & Faber (USA). His work has been translated into over ten languages. He lives between London and Delhi.

The description of the author is not related to article which has to be judged separately but because I found this fascinating. Divider in chief.. good title. This is a fake article just got a message on Whatsapp that UNESCO has declared Mudiji as the bestest PM in the world and NASA has claimed that Mudiji's 56 inch chest can be seen from Space.

The opposition is utterly incompetent, have gone way too comfortable in their golden thrones. This was more of a referendum than it was election.People voted on having Modi as a PM or not.They clearly want him as our PM .


I don't like the other alternatives like mayawati,mamta banerjee,as do many people.They are as bad if not worse than modi in every aspect.


Mamta banerjee is so paranoid of losing power , she openly censors media and her party workers openly cause violence in her name.


She is not a fighter for democracy,just another dictator. [deleted] I have said this before and I am saying it again. India didn't lose its soul because Modi is the PM but Modi is PM because India had already lost its soul. It's very easy to blame one person, in this case Modi, for this but that's so far away from the actual problem. There are just so many of us who are bigoted and ignorant who think in masculinity, which is why surgical strikes are celebrated more than diplomacy. And this is not even just an Indian problem. We are seeing this spreading across the globe organically. We are in for troubled times the world over. My take away from the election is that we've changed. This isnt the India I grew up in. India has changed and I didnt notice. 

The most easiest thing to blame could be my age. But I'm sure that my own myopic world view is also to blame. The days of collecting melt wax to fashion another candle are gone. When they left, I dont know, but they definitely are gone. I just never realized.


We're still casteist, despite people voting modi across caste lines, we're still majoritarian, we're still the same bigoted people we always were. But we're not as poor and poverty ridden as we used to be. The average Indian is so much better today that BijliSadakPani is not enough. They demand more. And the person that voices their aspirations is who they want in the seat of power - regardless of his capability or history.


This is us now, whether I like it or not. This is us now, and the oppositions hasnt realized it. [deleted] [removed] WhatsApp forwards has structurized the people in such a way that they have anti views for Congress. People have changed their mindset for both General election and Vidhan Sabha elections. Opposition didn't have a leader which can lead the Congress against NaMo. Balakot and Pulwama helped a lot to the BJPians in the name of nationalism. RaGa slogan was to remove Modi that's gave a advantage to people. I find it fascinating how disconnected people are with other ideologies.

As per the sangh, they are never about destroying India's soul. They are about **rediscovering** India's soul that was destroyed and denatured (but never completely!) over a period of 1000 years by un-Indian and anti-Indian foreign forces. That in fact is the entire motive for Hindutva.

If you want to start talking to the sangh (and the vast majority of Indians who support them) and be taken seriously, you at least must make an attempt to understand where they are coming from. All I see from the left are comical caricatures of the sangh's position. The bjp cleverly hijacked the mass sentiments that was high after the failed “india against corruption” movement. India at that time was heading towards a revolution. They just positioned themselves as a political alternative to a system collapse/revolution. People had become disillusioned with our system rife with corruption and extortionism-  and it was at a time when social media was just getting traction. the bjp realised that social media had exhausted itself in the urban areas but was slowly increasing in the rural areas (even in 2019 its rising). They did the math and successfully set a colour (saffron) to their movement - along with advertising and bollywood style narratives. It was a master plan. It is now a Hindu Rashtra. r/IslaminIndia

If I were speaking to Modi after the win, this is what I would say to him:

If the face of the Congress was Scindia, Pilot or even Tharoor, I am willing to bet the election would have turned out very very differently. 
Let me tell you a story

This all started when Janath Party got trashed in 1984 elections and had only 2 MP's....

So Advani went on mutli year long hindutva yatras encouraging communal violence culminating with Ram Mandir destruction which caused then PM VP Sing ordering Advani and team arrested even though he was PM due to BJP alliance.

When BJP pulled their support, VP Singh government fell. This is when VP Singh stood up in parliament and asked the question ""What type of India do you want""

BJP won at ton of seats in the 1991 elections and has been using communalism since then to gain vote banks....and we are seeing that clash going on today. Now I am not saying other parties do no use religion to gain votes, but no one did it the way BJP did it..

Godhra incident is directly correlated to Advanis hindutva yatras encouraging communal violence

This will all go away in about 15 years when people realize religion and politics just do not mix...because the over whelming majority of people in India just wants to have a decent life where we get along with our neighbors irrespective of cast, creed, religion.

That is the kind of India we Indians believe in and thats what we want for our kids fuck the guardian > During this spring’s campaign, he also clarified that he is an unreconstructed ethnic-religious supremacist, with fear and loathing as his main political means.

This is from Pankaj Mishra's NYT piece. Really, NaMo ""clarified"" that? Where is the link, Mishraji, or are you the one simply a hater here clarifying on his behalf? India is not as polarized as made out by western media. All the vile hate agenda being relentlessly thrown at Modi has only helped the lotus bloom. And the ""we know what's better for you than you do"" tone is not helpful either. It is condescending to the Indian voter and insult to the Indian democracy. Biased af, outstanding journalism! For all those who are painting a gloomy picture after the elections and telling the world how fucked up this country is, know this fact, that wherever you go, whatever you do, you'll always be an Indian. You can't escape that identity. And when you meet a friend from abroad, he'll point a finger at you saying; 'bloody savage Indian.' Hope that makes you proud.

Why not change the way things are happening? Why don't you leave your cushy life and start working for the masses like Atishi and hope to change people's mindset for the better? It's easier to sit in an ac room and type away in a keyboard and complain incessantly, but actually taking charge and changing things is a whole different ballgame. I am no pro-modi. I am no anti-modi too. My concerns are targeted towards India as a country.   

My biggest concern is the way media has been portraying the Modi Government for the past few years. There is no spine to criticise the government at all for any unfavourable decisions. Sure, the good work has to be praised. Credit has to be given where its due. But at what expanse. It feels as if the media houses have become the official spokespersons of the NDA. And anyone critical about their views has become an anti-national. Every time a relevant question is asked by anyone, he is targeted by the IT brigade. 

Media is considered the 4th pillar of a democracy  throughout the world for a reason. The reason to be rational and critical of the people in power. The reason to praise the good work done by the people in power. The reason to become the voice of the public. In contrast the media houses in our country seem to be defending the government against the right questions. 

Look at all the interviews our beloved PM gave prior to the elections. Not a single journalist showed spine to ask the relevant questions. India's soul is already lost. The bigot which was lying dormant has been awakened. UK who is gonna cancel the Brexit referendum because they are not happy with the first result wants to give a lesson on politic ? Funny.

'Ban Alcohol or We Won't Vote': Rural Women in South India Warn Political Leaders,161,bgh0h2,https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/mb8an4/ban-alcohol-or-we-wont-vote-rural-women-in-south-india-warn-political-leaders,26,,Ajaatshatru34," [removed] I think Alcohol sale should definitely be regulated, dare I say, to poorer people. The number of cases where men throw away money on Alcohol and indulge in domestic violence is insane. All our maids and servants had stories of their husbands beating them up and taking their money and buying alcohol. ""Mera aadmi paise leleta hai mere"" banning any drug is stupid. It just increases black market and crimes. Instead use the tax collected from it's sales to build rehabilitation centres and educate people.

Addicts need healthcare not jails. I don’t know if it’s even possible, but the culture about alcohol needs to change in India. 

Drinking is never going to go away, we might as well think about it as something done for leisure and not something done out of forced habit. 

Maybe we should consider not demonising alcohol itself, but rather alcoholism. I don’t know how it would work, but I’d believe a good place is starting to not shit on anybody who drinks. 

There’s so much India (or at least Tamil Nadu) gets wrong about people who drink casually. The way to go about alcoholism in rural areas is women empowerment. Not banning alcohol. 

/rant Banning anything has never worked ever. See Bihar, after the alcohol prohibition people there catch a bus and go to neighboring states to get drunk. Bootleg alcohol business has increased. Police is busy making money like a mafia from this situation. Elections are over, you can't vote either. I don't understand why it's so much of an issue in some of the states. In my home state of UP, it was always easy but now a days its even more easy after Bihar prohibition act when UP government exponentially increased the number of liquor license to fill the gap and welcome visitors from Bihar. We get it from the neighbouring states.  Bans don't work. The black market thrives under it, so do neighbouring states where alcohol is not prohibited. Moreover the quality of alcohol that the poor people drink here is really not healthy. Ban women or we won't vote!

Solve the brain drain as well as ""caste"" discrimination. Win-win. [removed] And then people complain about brain drain. A rich obc boy who scores 33 pases the exam while a poor general boy who scores 54 fails tye exam. Well caste politics is ruining our country. I'm happy to see a change of attitude in the comments tho OBCs are not oppressed people of society, dalits are.According to government ,Even jats and marathas (the oppressors) are OBCs . here comes the vote bank politics. Look for opportunities outside India. This is the only option left. Saving that 27 percent for next election. Ah! here we go again Those are rookie numbers Unpopular opinion: We have to let OBC quotas go. SC's and ST's are the actual oppressed castes, maybe they deserve reservations. What I think we have to do is two things: One, remove OBC quotas. Two, a large scale survey on whether reservations have helped the oppressed classes. I remember seeing an article on Indian express on how only a few castes within these sections corner most of the benefits of reservations. When do we hear about OBCS getting opressed.It's the dalits that get beaten up or killed.Were OBC  even  oppressed or was this category  introduced just for reservation politics.Creamy layer is a joke. Why don't we just reserve categories for every caste and religion now. Take a demographics, and block every seat as applicable, no more open seats for anyone. If general category is 20% of India, then 20% to them, if they are 5% then give them 5%. Also do it for the religions as well. Just remove the entire concept of open seats and be done away with this non sense all together. How the fuck is this happening, what's the rationale, how are these ministers winning elections Let’s start a caste called general-caste and fight for reservations for this caste. Else days of our oppression are not far Shame. How about this : Keep the caste reservation but introduce an economic filter inside this reservation. So, say, if someone is from backward caste and rich, they get chucked out of this quota.

How hard is this to implement? Is our govt this stupid? Or the people are?

Edit : I want to know your views on this. Ahh, removing inequality using inequality. I am sure that will work out. Infact, I am quite sure these kinds of policies end up dividing the community more than uniting them. Kyunki general wale gand maraye....i want to say that i truely support the communities which have been opressed for decades but this just bogus. congress still running back to old policies that have been shown not to win them elections. Unpopular opinion, Are people going to use reservations now to attack on SC/ST/OBC now? I wont be surprised now if it starts happening.

Reservations should be done with, and I'm an obc myself, never used it thankfully. Reservation should be income based not cast based Riddle me this anti reservation guys. If there are x% of ST people in total population, for any sample ST people should be more or less x% statistically speaking, right? How come there is very high representation of upper caste people in jobs disproportionate to their population percentage ? Something somewhere must have gone wrong? Unless you say upper caste are inherently meritorious or something Isn't Modi an OBC.Never heard him tell a story of getting oppreseed  by upper caste boys except Gandhi pariwaar.Being a jumlebaaz he is, do you think he would have let such a story go to waste. That's a lot. This will hold up in court? 100% reservation kardo benchod let me just put this here, % of upper caste hindus in india is 22

Given the population distribution. General constitutes about 26%  according to census. Makes sense. But what is the population distribution by caste. Why is any government refusing to let that info out ? 
I don’t think brain drain will stop because of reservation. I don’t think General or OC are the only people who go abroad. It’s a pretty stupid college kid statistic.

We don't need 33% Women's reservation in Loksabha. We need a law that mandates minimum 33% seat allocation by every political party.,13,bz5q6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bz5q6a/we_dont_need_33_womens_reservation_in_loksabha_we/,10,"Yes, all we need is a law to mandate every political party (participating in more than 2 seats in a given election) to allocate 33 percent seats to women.

Two reasons for this view. 

1. Current failure of SC/ST reservation policy for Loksabha seats. As we know a total of 24.01%(131) seats are reserve to SC/ST combined. Now when this happens, all the candidates participating are from SC/ST for that seat. Hence the SC/ST votes are split. Hence, SC/ST community fails to elect a strong leader to represent them. Instead, this split vote results in victory of a candidate picked by others(Upper Castes). ([This is that reason close to 55% of reserved seats are won by BJP](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-of-bjps-additional-mps-from-sc/st-constituencies/articleshow/69501208.cms). Or Congress took advantage earlier). This defeats the whole purpose of reservation as it does not empower the community. If we reserve 33% seats to women, there will be similar scenario where all women are pitted against each other. The weakest one which men choose will be the one representing.
2. Success of TMC and BJD experiment in recent election. [Both parties allocated more then 33% percent seats.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tmc-fields-41-women-bjd-promises-33-will-other-political-parties-take-cue-98300) [Result is that more than 33% percent of candidates elected from these parties are women.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/42-of-bjd-mps-are-women-highest-ever-for-any-party/articleshow/69490501.cms)

&#x200B;

Do you think there would be any drawback by this policy? Doesn't this serve the purpose better?",strngerstruggle," Everyone will add their wife to the party to get 50% SP will put up women candidates in Maharashtra and shiv Sena in UP. No benefit

Anyways, most women will be proxy for their husband, father etc. We need policy and outlook changes rather than farcical changes like reservation This reservation won't help. In India, many politicians would put their wives, daughters in the seat just to meet the quota without giving them any control in practice. Just a puppet to meet the quota, Rabdi devi was a prime example. >Hence the SC/ST votes are split.

I don't see how this is counted as a failure of reservation. There's nothing stopping independent SC/ST leaders to contest independently. They already exist. More importantly, the fact that people still vote for other parties would mean that their votes would get split regardless of reservation. Not having reservation doesn't mean mainstream political parties can't field SC/St candidates to split votes.

Also, how is having a single SC/ST leader better or worse than having SC/ST representation across parties and parliament? If they are independent they would have even lower representation in the government. They may have a better bargaining power for post election alliances in case no single party gets a majority, but that also means that when a single party gets majority, they will lose all their influence over government decision-making. Mark 50% constituencies for women. Problem solved.",Political,2019-06-11 08:39:44

- He claimed that the FIR by the CBI does not impute any guilt on him.
- He has not even been accused formally of any wrongdoing.
- No chargesheet has been filed against him in any court.
- While the propaganda was being spread that he was absconding, he was actually with his lawyers the whole night, preparing his appeal for the SC, and he was actually in the Supreme Court when the appeals were filed!

- He reaffirmed his faith in the judiciary and the judges.

**Following is the FULL transcript, from the video, of what he said to the press**:  
(*Source*: [AICC Press briefing by P Chidambaram at Congress HQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k53p4wSFGTY).)

> *I believe the foundation of democracy is liberty. The most precious article of the constitution of India is article 21 that guarantees life and liberty. If I am asked to choose between life and liberty, I shall unhesitatingly choose liberty.*

> *Why are the years up till 1947 called the years of freedom struggle. Because to win freedom we must struggle. To preserve freedom too, we must struggle.*

> *In the last 24 hours, much has happened that has caused concern for some and confusion to many. My statement today is to dispel that concern and confusion.*

> ***In the INX media case. I have not been accused of any offence***. *Nor has anyone else including any member of my family been accused of any offence. In fact,* ***there is no chargesheet filed by either the CBI or the ED before a competent court***. *Moreover,* ***the FIR recorded by the CBI does not impute to me any wrongdoing. Yet, there is a widespread impression that grave offences have been committed***, *and my son and I have committed those offences.*

> *Nothing can be further from the truth.*

> ***These are lies spread by pathological liars.***

> *When I was summoned by the CBI, and then the ED, to appear for questioning, I naturally sought interim protection against arrest from the competent court. I was granted interim protection by the orders of the high court dated 31 may 2018 and 25 july 2018. I have enjoyed the interim protection from the last 13-15 months. The matters were finally heard on 23 jan 2019 and judgements reserved. Now, after 7 months, yesterday the high court was pleased to dismiss the pre-arrest bail applications.*

> *My lawyer, who are also my dear friends, and who are present here, advised me to move the SC. On my behalf they did so yesterday evening, and today. They appealed repeatedly to the honourable SC to list the appeals for hearing urgently and in the meanwhile grant me interim protection.* ***While my lawyers, all senior counsels, were moving the SC, other lawyers and I worked through the night last night to prepare the papers. We completed the task only this morning and immediately filed the appeals in the SC. I was working alongside my lawyers the whole of last night. Today, throughout the day I was with my lawyers following the proceeding in the SC.***

> ***I was aghast that I was accused of hiding from the law. On the contrary I was seeking protection from the law. I was accused of running away from justice. On the contrary I was engaged in the pursuit of justice.***

> *My lawyers have told me that despite their impassioned pleas, their cases were not listed for today nor will they be listed tomorrow. but will be only listed on Friday. I bow down to the order of the honourable SC.*

> *Between now and Friday, I shall walk with a clear conscience and my head held high.* ***I shall respect the law, even if it is applied with an unequal hand by the investigating agencies.*** *In the name of freedom I can only hope and pray the investigating agencies will also respect the law. In the present circumstances, respect for the law can only mean one thing - await the decision of the honourable SC on Friday.*

> *Some days ago, when I spoke in Parliament, I had said that every judge in this country will uphold the liberty of the citizen. I had said the collective conscience and the institutional memory of the court as a venerable institution will guide all judges of the country.* 

> *As much as I believe in liberty, I also believe in the wisdom of our judges. So friends, until Friday and beyond, the lamp of liberty will shine bright and illuminate the whole country.*

Imagine you get Rs 1,000 or Rs 1,500 for your vote. Well you may not consider but these people thats alot of money. They take their parents, kids, relatives and get commissions too. 

This is our state as of now. These people are unfortunately illiterates and the government wants to keep it that way because literate questions to which they dont have answers. Wtf itna content kaha milega I don't get that why are the voters so calm as if nothing happened? I am pretty sure that these people are no fool who don't understand what's happening. Original source: Twitter handle of journalist Vinod Sharma. 

[Link](https://newscentral24x7.com/booth-capture-west-bengal-evm-lok-sabha-elections/) to news article. Why did it happen : 1) Corruption in politics  ,2) Lack of education and 3) fear from local goons (most likely. It's hard to  change points 1 and 3. But , 2) is in the voter's hand. Either be educated and be just in your right to vote. Or these clips will be still rolling and there will unfortunately be no effect. One thing I never understood is why, in class 11/12 students are not given practical demonstration for  voting system. How it works, what is the procedure,what are the rules and regulations and violations. Sad man. It's pretty sad. Why does she use the voter's hand to press the button like it's symbolically supposed to mean something... Is India really a democracy? Where are the ""Congress Bhakts"" and ""BJP Bhakts"" at?
We are waiting for your fight. # The sad state of democracy in India :( WTF??? Hey I don't live in India, and I have a question! 

&#x200B;

This is the second video of this sort I've seen in the past few days where a citizen's voting seems to be controlled. Does this happen often? Hope the educated people of Bengal realize the gravity of this situation and rid the State off TMC. This aunty is so fucked now Save Bengal save democracy It is clear that the actual voter is present but (s)he is not the one who is casting the vote. This woman, whatever her official role to be present in the situation, is the one who is casting the vote. Are there no observers to watch for such irregularities? Normally an observer is allowed for each candidate to be present at the polling station -- and they should have raised an objection to the practice of this lady. https://twitter.com/prakashraaj/status/1128189330214621184?s=09

I guess this is a different video with different place and people doing the same thing. whoever recorded this should be given a medal u/VredditDownloader Democracy has been compromised. I have lost hope for my Nation. I would've said maybe the voters didn't know how to and asked her but I don't see them saying anything. This is so screwed up. Why don't we have double blind voting yet? Wtf man...that's insane Not justifying it but I have experienced this close quarter. 

These people are so ill educated that they wouldn't understand even if you explained, the very complicated process of pressing a button, to them several times over. Like forget going through the process of determining the candidate who will represent you in Delhi just the process of pressing a button is Rocket Science to them.

The second voter in all fairness was relieved that someone did that difficult task of whatever she was supposed to do for her. Probably came into the polling booth in the first place cause of curiosity and social pressure.

Why did the polling officers allow it? If they don't they will eventually have to explain it to her which will take 5 mins. Optimistically even if they had to explain the eintire process to a 100 people that's 500 mins of delay which equals roughly 6 hours. 

Again not justifying anything again just mu tuppence Democracy !!!! Fucking rigged Send this video to Election Commission ASAP WTF??!! What is wrong with people? I thought taking money from political parties is the worst I have seen in Tamil Nadu, but this one stops even lower. Makes me wonder if we Indians really deserve freedom. Wtf??? Somebody smash her head on voting machine If I remember  correctly, I saw a similar video where these officers were casting votes of some Muslim women and were talking about how Muslims should be denied their voting rights Even bangladesh is better than wb at this stage India is not just a land of multiple cultures. There's democracy and dictatorship too. Mamta jiti to aage bhi aesa hi dekhne ko milne wala hai.

Shame They would dismiss the exams in Universities and schools for this kind of cheating. All I can see is a helping hand.

Long time back, these people used to come to home and show how to vote. I guess now they are doing it at the poll rather than wasting time going home to home. Ye to Khuch zyada hee madad ho gaya🤣🤣🤣 It's good that we have proof of elections being rigged. We have State of the art EVM machines. Now we need to strengthen the voting process. I hope this doesn't happen in any part of the country in the next elections. as far as didi is concerned, she is playing 90s politics in 2020s. Not gonna work.

Socrates was right about democracy. i think they are helping her to vote Har vote Mudi But EC told us EVMs make it impossible to rig voting.

Just last night, I posted a series of stories on Instagram about my views on it and I did criticize the forces' and government's past actions. Basically I pointed out how when we talk about KP genocide we should also talk about how AFSPA has been grossly misused by forces there and the atrocities they committed in torture camps against the Kashmiri Muslims. The government already has avenged KPs but now what they're doing is state sponsored terrorism. The govt has now become fascist and authoritarian.

I also wrote how we should put our faith in the people and not the government because this government is not for the people . They're oppressive and controlling the narrative. 

Also, I am from the forces background. I did write that put your faith in people and not the government because this government has agendas and has already failed us by passing all these bills whilst ignoring the demands of the communities concerned with those bills.

My Insta account is not private. It does have my pictures. I just have 800 followers. So my mom read those stories and got really pissed off. She said I could be taken away by the government. They could charge me under SEDITION and I should delete them. Also got a moral lecture about how you have been brought up in the forces and yet your views disgust me. 

TL;DR : So basically I want to know ,

A) Can I or anyone be charged for sedition for showing solidarity with Kashmiris or speaking against the government in words like I did?

B) Should I delete those stories or not?",RebelBabel," I don't use social media , but whenever ,I did I always made sure to keep my Political views to myself only.


I only discuss politics with very  one or two friends in real life ,who I know won't fight or call you names. A. No
B. Your choice Speaking against the government or showing solidarity with Kashmiris is not seditious. But they can charge you. They can charge a person with sedition even for snoring. A) Yes you can. All it takes is a pissed off person with power. 

B) You probably should. Under the current political climate who knows what can be done. Right now anything is possible. I too have a public Account on insta but I try to post whatever is true. The government is being fascist and the citizens of India are to be blamed for that. 1. Yes, you can be. In addition to that, you'll witness many people forwarding screenshots of your posts to your university/workplace and demanding your expulsion.

2. You should, it's not worth it. Get caught in the crosshairs of the wrong people, and your life will be over. A:

\- If you are muslim, chances of a sedition complaint are higher. Social media *is* being monitored.

\- Regardless of religion, you are making yourself and your family a target for right wing vigilantes. They are known to make threat calls.

\- If you have a relative active in the forces, your comments may adversely affect their professional life in some way.

\- Even if you are safe today, you never know who'll dig up what in future. The rightwing always seems to need a ""them"" - an ""other"" - to motivate themselves. Persecution based on past activities have happened in many countries around the world. Even in USA the land of liberty, in the 50s, anybody who had so much as attended socialist meetings were persecuted by a guy named McCarthy.

&#x200B;

B. Should you delete them? I think you'll have to introspect how much you are prepared to sacrifice for your principles. It's highly unlikely India will turn liberal / progressive / humanitarian for at least 5-6 *decades* if at all, IMO. China has completed 7 decades without any of that. Even a real life political movement for liberal principles is unlikely to get majority support in India. Your IG digital thoughts have zero chance of changing anything. Moreover, society in future may not even appreciate your sacrifices if you do get involved in a real life movement - just look how society vilifies freedom fighters like Nehru today. So, you'll have to introspect how much you are ready to sacrifice.",Political,2019-08-27 13:09:46
"Smriti Irani's aid, Surendra Singh shot in Amethi",363,bt33o2,https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/lok-sabha-2019/story/smriti-irani-close-aide-shot-at-in-amethi-dies-1534810-2019-05-26,144,,BigChungus48," Wtf is going on... This is fucked up Ugly side of political rivalry The BJP has the state, the BJP has the union. They have all the law enforcement agencies they can use to investigate this. Hopefully they do that well and correctly. I remember what a party president said once “ In this country even the PM does not get justice… If some person kills the PM and is released, then how will a common man get justice? It's a point to ponder. This is my heart’s voice. I don't believe in capital punishment, as it won't bring my father back. But it is not just a matter of my father or the family, it is the matter of the country” the way law and order has been working in UP, the ones who did this act, have their days numbered, forget courts, its straight judgement! Can't win them so just kill them. Modern problems require ancient solutions. 

Ps: sarcasm I am really shook by this news. And what surprises me is the liberals who should not be taking sides , are not uttering a work. Just imaging if close aid of Rahul Gandhi is shot.

Guys , this is getting ridiculous. Again this has come down to bhakt and others. A man has lost his life, can we not take a break from politics and demand an unbiased investigation?

People becoming  narrow minded is big issue , I see. Well.. it’s quite expected from congress. They are a party of thugs masquerading as intellectual. I just watched an interview with smriti Irani on India today. 

Fairly softball interview however, she never once said anything that can be perceived as arrogance...

Quite amazing set of answers in fact... Highly recommend. This may be the beginning of hate crime era in India. Lots of comments here saying BJP did this or Congress did this. Well, no one actually cares that a crime has happened and the state government is responsible for such a lack of law and order. We are a democracy that has never asked the right questions in 70+ years of independence. If this has any of the Congress goons backing, consider the party to be doomed for ever.  Well BJP didn't acused Rahul Gandhi of this so why so much hate let police do its work. Perfect exhibit of Rahul's politics of love It is sad that no one is attributing this killing to Rahul Gandhi. That is precisely the reason he doesn't find traction in Indian electorate :P:P     

If people thought he could pull something like this off - his acceptance might have increased a bit. [removed] So much for the love. Turns out it's just a jumla. He did hard work on ground level to make sure that Bahu wins. She won. He asked for a proper role in the State BJP and knew way many secrets about the Bahu, Kaka and stuff like that.  He is dead.

PS- I know Amethi. [removed] RIP

I’m kinda not surprised since its BJP. There is so much violence that they try to kill each other for power. Meanwhile in BJP IT cell: Let's brainstorm how to put the blame for this murder on RG.

I wouldn't expect anything less from a party who's PM asked for votes in the name of Pulwama victims. [removed] see all the upvotes are from congress god say ? let law take its own course /s It's inside job.

Dad Called Me Khan Market Gang: Being Anti-Modi In A Bhakt Family,310,brlsv2,https://www.thequint.com/elections/dad-called-me-khan-market-gang-being-anti-modi-in-a-bhakt-family,170,,Spideyocd," A relative of mine posted a fake newspaper clipping about Rahul Gandhi being a drug addict on a WhatsApp group. A quick Google search showed me that the pic was generated on an online ""newspaper clipping generator"". 

Five minutes later I shared the same newspaper clip claiming mudi zi drank gau mutra daily. 

From then on I became the resident antinational on the family group. Will someone explain me what ""Khan Market Gang"" means? I've never heard it until I saw this post. Dad here calls me Tukde Tukde Gang ka member Saying Modi in my house is kinda banned. I don't hate him but my family does. I once joked about Modi coming to our house and my mom said she will not open the door lol. I have an aunt (Highly educated) who is my friend on facebook. She started using FB few years back and now she is massive bhakt sharing fake news, manipulated facts and like every Modi post. 

A couple of times I made her notice that she is sharing news from unreliable resources and fake news. Argument went upto Kanhaiya Kumar. I asked her few logical questions for which she had no answers.

A call to mom from her.

Now I am a member of Tukde Tukde Gang. Friends who used to come to my home and eat beef during Christmas calls me a 'rice bag convert' in heated discussions. Lol!! same problem with my dad. Now I just don't argue with him. It's very tiring when every minute of breakfast and dinner is dominated by a news channel running Modi Modi Modi Modi nonstop.

1. Zee News
2. Republic Bharat
3. India TV
4. Aaj Tak

List goes on. I think I'll stop having food in the same room. 1. Communist
2. Go to Pakistan
3. Anti national

A list of things I've been called I am a certified proud member of Khan market Gang carrying deadly weapon of reason and logic 😍 How do I apply for membership of Khan Market Gang? I think I am very lucky to have parents that never talk about politics while having dinner/lunch. Same here. Yesterday my dad said ""inhe padha likha k bhi galti hi kardi"" to me and my sister.

He knows education is the best cure to Bhaktness My dad call me ""Deshdrohi"" aka Anti-naushnal :D I've been called anti-national and anti-hindu by my friends, that hurt. Expected. He is, after all, the ""divider-in-chief""! I heard this phase in an NDTV show a couple of days ago. What does it mean? And origin? [removed] I am really really lucky in this regard, my dad  criticizes Modi a lot, and taught me about emergency during Indira Gandhi when books and articles had stories only about her greatness. In my family, they always vote on the basis of caste. We are a Brahmin family and there is a brahmin candidate from BJP in my constituency. He is being elected for over 10 to 15 years now. He isn't that bad but there are other deserving candidates. 

I am anti-BJP. I have successfully turned all my family members to hate BJP by telling them what exactly BJP has done to fool the people. It was a long debate but, they did accept at the end that BJP is actually shit. But, even after this, I know they will go and press the lotus button in polling booth. 

No one can change people unless the media becomes honest and unless people get proper tech education about not to use WhatsApp and Facebook as news source. Seriously its all about hindu/ muslim shit brewed by the media channels 24/7, no one even care about real issues . The threat is created out of thin air and sadly everyone’s buying it. I asked my mate that so many muslim families lives in our neighborhood since 3 decades and nothing happened but he kept on repeating “ hindu khatray main hai “. Its just fake fear mongering Hashtag Election **2109**?

Anyway, I'm fortunate enough to be born in a (mostly) centrist family. As for the hopeless cases, many of which are our family friends and neighbors, I can only say this- there was a time EU suffered through this shit. It wasn't until they lost a lot of lives and money by way of pointless wars that they got the sense knocked into them that nationalism brings nothing but utter destruction. Once they understood this, they rebuilt what was left and started focusing on development. India is probably headed the same way. what is the history behind khan market? Sad that the future of our generations are being decided by old conservative farts. One of my close college friends called me a pseudo leftist/secular anti-national because I debunked some fake news sent by him. We don’t talk any more and he tries to turn other people against me by bitching behind my back saying I don’t respect traditions,etc. Well tbf you are calling your family a ""Bhakt Family"" Modi - divides families IMO NDA is not getting simple majority this time. In 2014 there was a huge Modi wave, nobody could say a single word against him, still they “somehow” managed to get a majority. 

Come 2019, there is no Modi wave to speak of, Modi is abused/ridiculed in social media and in public. I just don’t see how NDA can get majority this time.

If Congress has/had Muslim votebank, “hindutva vadi” are BJPs votebank. Just that BJPs votebank is very loud these days. Have to feel sorry for people here..luckily I don't have any such problems due to majority of family are secular and against feku.Few odd guys are they who worship feku but doesn't bring out their bhaktigiri in family meetings though :) Is your dad friends with some sanghi unkils? Divide and conquer algorithms Just stopped arguing. Every criticism of modi turns into ""SO YOU LOVE PAPPU?"" Somebody ELI5 Khan Market Gang and Tukde Tudke gang. Divider in Chief dividing family members at home!

Har Har Modi! Ghar Ghar Modi! Relatable And everyone clapped. On a more serious note, didn't happen, Nope. thanks for my dad, actually listen to valid criticisms of modi , he was congress voter , failed by incompetence of congress, there are millions like him who were wooed by modi's ultimately hollow promises. I don't know why people discuss politics with family members and colleagues, and then complain about being outcasted. Political discussion is supposed to be made with like-minded people. Why Khan Market gang though? Isn't Khan Market one of the more posh areas of Delhi? only on quint Why are you anti-someone? If you are not pro-someone, that doesn't mean that you have to be anti-someone. Me and my dad have the same conversation, but we both acknowledge what he did wrong and what he did right. And I respect his opinions because he has seen more politicians than me, but I try keep my point as politely as possible. Although him calling you Khan market gang is absurd, but maybe it was because most Muslims hate Modi for being Modi. I am not pro-Modi neither I am anti-Congress or pro-Congress. My loyalty lies with the party who addresses the real problem. [deleted]",Political,2019-05-22 15:38:56

I mean all this is so depressing that I sitting in my metro house would not believe in these stories if we didn't have enough evidence.

I know corruption is everywhere (I'm sure it exists in the so called cultured western countries too) but here **we are staring at an alarming level of negligence and manipulation from our police**. I mean earning some extra money to grant someone a favorable position in commerce is one thing (not that that's correct) but covering up for rape and murder for money is baffling. In Badaun it's reported that even CBI was acting on behalf of the politicians.

We have enough evidence that the system has failed miserably that no one (at least in the middle class) is safe anymore. Come to think of it, **if some super rich person does something wrong to you, you can't really do anything** as I am pretty sure that they'd have the resources to buy the police and facts will be twisted against you. Somehow this fear is quite haunting to live with.

What amazes me more is how we, our media and the government & machinery conveniently forget about these incidents once the fire subsides. I wonder what's the tipping point - what is it that we are we expecting to happen for a revolution to take place against the current police system. I wonder if there is someone at the top who actually cares about sorting out this mess and making police accountable for their work. I am sure there are enough case studies (probably from South America) where it was equally fucked up, if not worse....and people tried to clean it up.

**TL:DR:** Seen enough examples of police system failure, amazed how we all are cool with it. What is it that will help India improve its systems. Is anything happening? Is there anyone even interested in that?",Ghenchebaz," Elect better chief ministers and MLAs.

Despite all the money and the muscle, ultimately it's the voter who ultimately presses a button on the EVM and makes a call about who gets to govern.

If you don't find the crop of candidates offered by BJP/Congress/your local major party acceptable, vote for the most honest independent candidate on the ballot. Don't worry about your vote going waste or any such complex arithmetic, vote for the honest independent.

The unfortunate reality is that there is staggering amount of ignorance and backwardness among the voters. This does not get talked about often, but our literacy rate is ~~74%~~ < 80%, and half of those counted in the figure can't explain ""twinkle twinkle little star"".

You are being silly if you think it's a hope,ess doomsday scenario. Our literacy rates have been worse - less than 20% when we became independent. But they can be a lot better. It's just going to take time and generations for education to seep in, but it gets better every single day. Nicely constructed and well written sir......  I would like to add to this by saying that I blame Media most for this. Media performs as an eye opener for the public on such things and form a public opinion on this matter by discussing on this, by brainstorming on this and keeping matters such as this alive in the minds of public until a permanent resolution is reached .

But Indian media is now more corrupt than the government it seems. Investigative journalism is almost non-existent and reporters who do such journalism to reach the root cause of the issue are either killed or silenced by threat of life, which again the media rather than highlighting, suppress with stupid news of Bollywood celebs wedding or some other [garbage. No](https://garbage.No) intellectual debate happening on concerned matters, no hard questions asked to political representatives of important matters, only biased political debate goes on in any news channel. 

It seems Media only now cares about forwarding the propaganda of their political bias or about How cute Taimur looks!!!! There is a huge manpower shortage in the police department. The police-population ratio, currently 192 policemen per lakh population, is less than what is recommended by UN i.e. 222 policemen per lakh population. I am an unkil here , may be downvoted for my comment , but I must share my experience . Don't be poor and weak in this country. If you have money , then police , admin , politicians, all will work for you. Else you are on your own. Because of the populatoon, Life is cheap and expendable in India. Given this, I don't see any change happening soon. 

Also the elected officials are busy in pushing their propaganda, so any bill to reform police system is not on their plans for foreseeable future. Our leadership has to take some drastic measures too. For example [Mikheil Saakashvili](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikheil_Saakashvili) a former Georgian president drastically improved conditions in Georgia. 

Quoting from the link here:
>At the time Saakashvili took office, Georgia suffered from a stagnant economy, widespread corruption by police and state officials to the point where bribery was needed for any kind of commercial transaction, high crime rates, and severe infrastructure problems, including widespread power outages, and schools and medical facilities falling into disrepair.

>Saakashvili set out on a massive reform program. He systematically fired politicians, public officials, and police officers suspected of corruption and significantly raised the salaries of state employees to the point where they could depend on their salaries rather than bribes for a living. Many oligarchs who had dominated the economy were arrested, with most agreeing to pay massive fines into the state budget in exchange for their freedom. Saakashvili reformed the economy by cutting red tape which had made business difficult, courting foreign investment, simplifying the tax code, launching a privatization campaign, and tackling widespread tax evasion. Due to the establishment of a functioning taxation and customs infrastructure, the state budget increased by 300% within three years. The government massively upgraded infrastructure and public services. In particular, water and power infrastructure was improved to the point where it functioned effectively, schools and hospitals were renovated, more roads were laid, and new housing developments were built.

>As a result, the rate of corruption in the country was drastically reduced and the business environment was improved significantly. Here - dona search for police reform in india, search for committee reports and see what they say.

You want change, then Start getting educated so you can push the conversation forward. 

India’s issue is that it’s citizens expect someone else to be smart for
Them.

Your formulation of the problem is miles better than what most people have - few people even focus on police reform.

Get informed. Know your rights. That’s the first step everyone needs to take. The change you are looking for is within you. The world is entering a new age, when it does make sure you have a say in what it is, else your ideals will mean zilch.",Political,2019-07-30 15:08:09
BYJU's using clickbait video titles on YouTube for advertising,681,bsq93a,https://i.redd.it/viyhamsy4a031.png,109,,Mastermind1703," I work as an intern in Byju's Sales Team. Just saw this thread as a great opportunity to share the horrible tactics taught to us by our sales managers. BYju's offers a 1-month trial period for any package that we sell. Salesmen sell the product and stop returning calls for 1 month so that parents can't claim for refund. We make students give fake tests and embarass them in front of theor parents by 'discussing' the solutions to these tests and thus prove to the parent that app-based education is necessary to clear the concepts.

Edit.: Byjus basically uses the fear parents have regarding their children's education and turn that into money. If you want clickbait advice no one better than mumbaikar nikhil ! Irony is that channel's name is CBSE Students India Sadly! These things actually work. Even though they'll get a lot of dislikes and stuff. But the main idea is getting the message out there.

And kept manipulating the students by saying if you don't like it just format the SD card and use it for storage. There is no waste.

Voting should be made into a legally binding civic duty.,3,cr5dbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cr5dbi/voting_should_be_made_into_a_legally_binding/,21,"The previous election had a measly 67% voter turnout (which was the highest ever in the history of the country!)
If we are going to elect ministers that make laws for all of us, they should be voted in through an election participated by *by all of us*. 
Australia has mandatory voting and you can be penalised for not turning in to vote. I think India should adopt it too. 
You don't like the candidates? Go for NOTA. Fair enough. But don't be a b!tch about how the country has gone to dogs when you haven't bothered to get off your backside to go and vote.",Molagutal," NOTA is ineffective which is one of the major factors for people not turning up.

NOTA needs to be reworked and given importance. Right now, even if NOTA gets majority of the votes, the next person in line will be elected which defeats the purpose of NOTA. First thing voting is a right not a duty there is a difference between right and duty. If you have right to vote it means you also have right to not vote. Often political groups, individual and organization use not voting as a tool to express their opinion. By making this Civic right binding you will take away their freedom of speech. 

Often we hear about small villages in India Boycott voting to express their angers towards political parties, they do it because that is the only way they are left with. Often it is just a media drama but they convey their problem though this. 

You can promote voting but you can not force people to vote and this is how it should be.

EDIT : People don't vote not just because they are lazy they don't vote because they have lost faith in our fucking broken political system. Maybe we need better laws to police the politicians not the citizens. 

Also recommend you watch George Calrin's view on voting, it's available on YouTube. In any position or opinion you have, please consider the cons of your position. So, please give it a bit more thought and think about the disadvantages of ""mandatory voting"". No, it is my right to not to vote. Improve the voting process first: [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/90-of-those-who-didnt-vote-in-2014-actually-couldnt/articleshow/67508052.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/90-of-those-who-didnt-vote-in-2014-actually-couldnt/articleshow/67508052.cms)

&#x200B;

Also, IMO, going forward, voting will matter less and less, because laws are not being legislated based on what is good for people, not being discussed nor debated by those who have won regardless of ruling or opposition parties, not being reviewed by parliamentary committees, not being put up for public consultations, and not taking any feedback into account. Voting is now just a we believe in you do whatever you want exercise. or you know, don't reduce democracy to a head counting principle? Don't reduce democracy to mere elections. 

Rousseau has said ""Englishmen are free only once in 5 years"" (when they vote)

The need of the hour is to promote de-centralisation and more devolution of powers to local elected governments, rather than making voting a LeGaLly BinDiNG CIvIc DuTy \- nota should count, as babaruth said.  
\- it should be possible to cast votes without having to travel.  
and first, those stupid elected NETAs should be penalized on skipping parliament sessions. How is not voting any different from going for NOTA? There is so many reasons to factor for not voting. Not available to vote, sickness, travelling, mental illnesses, intoxication, responsibilities, and personal beliefs and choices. 

It won't be wise to make it compulsory. I concede. I thought it was quite straight forward. While it can be done and may get results, there are more complications in execution than I previously considered.

"It Is Not a Voter's Concern Where Political Parties' Money Comes From, AG Tells SC",129,bbxmz3,https://thewire.in/government/electoral-bonds-supreme-court,39,,Dumma1729," > The AG, however, according to LiveLaw, had a different take on how much information a voter needs to have. “It is not voter’s concern to know where the money comes from. Transparency cannot be looked as a mantra. What is the realities of the country. This is a scheme that will eliminate black money from the election,” Venugopal was quoted as saying.

Yeah well when a Political party is taking money from companies it will be beholden to them and that concerns me as a citizen because then they are more incentivized to work for the company instead of the citizenry, especially if such monies are not disclosed/happen behind closed doors.

> Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioners, said that the electoral bond scheme has done nothing to curb black money. “All that you have done through the scheme is to open a banking channel also to donate anonymously,” LiveLaw quoted him as saying.

This whole black money charade is the financial equivalent of  National Security. Question Govt on Policy, ""sorry we can't answer you due to National Security reasons"". Benefit of xyz policy ? ""it will help curb black money."" Waise toh its not a voters . concern what a elected official does with his mandate either.. Waise toh we should just stop voting and let them buy their seats.. 

I mean why even bother with elections. He has to be the single biggest chutiya AG in the country's history. First Rafale-OSA and then this. This guy is forgetting SC is not known to have a lot of patience towards chutiyapa. Then its not a Neta's concern who voters vote for, why are they campaigning? Is this AG sabotaging the government by telling the truth that leaves SC no option but to throw out government arguments, or is he just dumb?

If the SC doesn't kill the law despite this anti deomcratic statement by the government, they'll expose themselves to be sellouts. But hey, at least BJP isn't dynastic. They are super patriots. They have only good intentions! Look at Balakot! Also the sun rose at 6am today! Didn't rise at 6am during Coward congress time!

I trust Modi only! But Nehru's ghost isn't letting him work.

Btw this aside, this AG also said during Adhaar trials that ""People are a property of the government, they aren't entitled to privacy by default""

And when I showed this stmt to blind bhakts their response: it was his personal opinions

And yet those same fucktards ask me why I oppose this incumbent party

Also, three language formula has been already going on since 1968 so there is nothing new in the new policy I would say that three language formula is good.....Because You have to learn your mother tongue, English is necessary and any other language that reduces such chaos.....

Now come to Raj......As a maharashtrian  I would say that this too sad.... I am Ahirani-Marathi(A language spoken by about 50 lakh people), and lives in pune. Still some people in pune thinks  I  should be from  Marathi family rather than ahirani? what is this rubbish? They correct my words for nothing... what tf is this? YOU are discriminating your fellow guy..

Here people listen to him and make bias against north Indians. I will give you some examples how people think...

1) I went to my uncle for some work...my aunt said that she wouldn't enroll her son to north Indian college because North Indians are violent.(All this because of political propaganda)

2)I was talking with a guy who told me that they judge people by their name-plate of bike. If your name-plate of bike has MH-12(pune rto initial) you are good biker, but MH-14(Pimpari Chinchwad) are bad bikers. Every man who broke the traffic rule were all from non-pune registration. All punekars have good sense of driving-skills.

Now it's on you how you would say on this reactions by people. By cousin actively posts anti-north Indian comments on his tweeter. This leader are useless. 

If I am sounding hard to you...This is reality. All BJP/RSS do is divide people. Few years ago there wasn't such friction as now, but now many would become 'anti-hindi' people. Spineless gujjus will never do something like this in fear of central government.

Cheers to Marathi for standing up for their language. There's something supremely ironic about Raj Thackeray of all people warning others to not incite the people My school used to have special English the hindi students would skip telugu to take spl eng while some of the telugu students would skip hindi to take it except there was nothing spl about that English it was taught by the same eng teacher new drafts doesn't imposes hindi but i think that even in non-hindi states including tamil nadu parents and teachers would select hindi for their kids knowing how effective and helpful it is when it comes to jobs and social life [deleted] But Hindi is our national language.",Political,2019-06-03 15:27:16

World Press Freedom Index,1684,bkgs0r,https://i.redd.it/e3f8fbmd04w21.jpg,143,,sudden_dust," What is the ""somewhat free"" reference to?

Edit : inserted ""is"". some one put a face of arnob on that doggie.. I don’t know where to get my news from. Honestly it’s a struggle everyday. Almost all articles and media reeks of non-objective reporting. What the prime minister says to his opponents or vice versa is not news to me. Real news should report on policies, law&order, economical & business statistics, government project reports, environmental reports, scientific achievements, medicinal breakthroughs, research developments etc.That’s what i want to read/see about. I think OP dont know how Wire, Quint, The Hindu, CNN and Most of the South Indian Medias works in India.

If aNews Media gets inclined to a Political Ideaology doesnt mean Media in India is chained...!!

And the Irony is this Cartoon were drawn for an Indian Media Far from it, most English speaking media is vehemently anti-Modi. Lol this is misleading. Do you even know how this whole methodology works. ना आप सोते हैं ना हमें सोने देते हैं Have you not seen fox news(US)? American media house are completely biased towards either of the two major political parties, or to industrial lobbies Aayie is report ka DNA Analysis karte hai. Yeah! US press is absolutely Free. 

News flash: Press in every country is somewhat free. Well if a cartoonist can make a cartoon like this, doesn’t it show that the media is atleast somewhat free? Am I missing something? Nah bro press everywhere is being fucked US media is free because they grill trump, So Indian media should also hate Modi to be considered free...

whoever made this comic, probably didn't hear of FOX news, They are so consumed by the western propaganda, how are they supposed to know whats best for India? Author's imagination must have stopped when he would have thought where and how to fit ""Chinese"" or ""Russian"" or ""Middle-East"" 'media(?)' in this drawing... Selective criticism always pay better, doesn't it?

Media, wherever & however free, always has biases. If not why would NYTimes depict cow cartoon without even praising ingenuity of Indian scientists with reference to satellite launch??

Some mistake having bias with slavery.. It may be of certain media houses but not of all... On my side of ideology =/= Free Media.

Every media owes, at minimum, its allegiance to certain ideology, if not a political party, they have their own agenda and it manifests in this cartoon too. How the cartoonist epitomizes west, especially the US, is just despicable. US media is extremely partitioned, both sides push their extreme narratives with no regard of truth.

On the other hand, free media =/= unbiased media, either.

The greatest casualty in this war of ideology is the truth. India was always considered not so good at press freedom, the international statistics was the same even before Modi. USA always had a good index even before Trump came to power. Press freedom index isn't related to Modi or Trump so this cartoon is kinda inaccurate in its depiction of political leaders. 

Many comments here probably never saw the press freedom index pre-Modi era to understand that India was never in a ""good"" zone. They are just spouting shit that comes to their heads. Trump Hating US media ≠ Free Media The US media is free to call Trump a dictator, so while they are free they are also either too dumb to be aware of the irony or know exactly what they're doing. A partisan press does nothing good for a country. press suppose to be anti-establishment (ideally without the bias), regardless whoever is governing, i don't know why people don't get it Channels like Republic TV and Times now have become brazen enough to not even pretend to hide their bias. Media is now business or leaning towards certain ideologies..i don't think there is any News channel or print media which is free of ideologies. If not ideology they are with whoever have power. By manjul I think should be on somewhat free classification. Since where would you put countries like Saudi, China, Somalia, Vietnam, etc. Ref: Press freedom rankings Rajat Sharma today - no low is low enough! Lol. There is no ""free"" press. Just like there's no ""honest"" journalism. They're all sponsored by interest groups and private companies, they tow their lines and shape public opinion for profit. That goes for almost all major news networks. They are owned by both right and left.

Read the article for more details EC is a joke in India. I have seen so many instances of poll violations over the years, and i haven't seen one high profile fellow facing any consequence. Remember how as CM, Mr. Modi on his affidavit did not provide marital status. But in LS 2014 affidavit he declared himself as Married. This was a case of lying on affidavit - something which is very serious. When a petition was filed in Gujarat HC, the Gujarat HC dismissed the petition saying it was **merit less** and **delayed**. Another additional session judge rejected the appeal just because the petitioner was not from Modi's constituency and thus had not right to question his candidature or affidavit. Laws do not apply to dictators. Ha ha they just make a scapegoat of the IT Cell incharge. given the mass following I can see some gobar filled andh bhakt volunteers to take the blame.

""Never imagined Gautam Gambhir to stoop so low,"" AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal tweeted after party accused him of circulating ""derogatory pamphlet"" on its candidate Atishi.

New Delhi: 

Atishi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate from East Delhi, broke down at a press conference today as her party accused her BJP rival Gautam Gambhir of circulating a derogatory, scurrilous pamphlet on her ahead of voting in Delhi on Sunday for the national election. Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: ""Never imagined Gautam Gambhir to stoop so low.""

""I have only one question for Gautam Gambhir. If he is doing this against one woman, what about the lakhs of women in east Delhi who are worried about their safety,"" Atishi questioned as she addressed reporters. 

Gautam Gambhir, a celebrated former cricketer, rubbished the allegation in a tweet implying that AAP had concocted the allegations to win.

AAP said the pamphlets, replete with low, personal allegations, were circulated by the BJP candidate in residential societies in East Delhi.


""Never imagined Gautam Gambhir to stoop so low. How can women expect safety if people wid such mentality are voted in? Atishi, stay strong. I can imagine how difficult it must be for u. It is precisely this kind of forces we have to fight against,"" tweeted Arvind Kejriwal.

Manish Sisodia, his deputy, said the language in the pamphlet was ""so abusive and low that everybody will feel ashamed while reading it"". Atishi, who is contesting her first election, has been working as an advisor to his Education ministry.


AAP, in a series of tweets, said ""If you have the strength, do read this pamphlet of BJP's Gautam Gambhir being distributed in East Delhi societies"".

Rejecting the allegations, the BJP's Mamta Kale said: ""Absolutely baseless charges have been levelled against Gautam Gambhir by AAP. AAP has a history of lying and politicizing things.""


Gautam Gambhir, a debutant in politics, joined the BJP last month. Apart from AAP's Atishi, he faces Arvinder Singh Lovely of the Congress.

Atishi had raised objections to Gautam Gambhir's candidature, saying he had voter ID cards from two constituencies. The ~~only~~ important question is: Did Gautam Gambhir condemn this or not?

If yes, good, if no, then he doesn't have my respect any more. 

What's sick is sick and no decent politician should be shy of calling it out.

EDIT: The BJP has condemned it:
> Speaking to The Quint, Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor condemned the pamphlet and said he cannot “assume of even speaking or writing such things.”
> 
> “The BJP has no association with the pamphlet. This is a product of the dirty tricks department of the AAP. Whenever in the last six years, they have sensed defeat, they have resorted to such tricks. From day one, Atishi was trying to destabilise the election campaign and this is one more trick,” said Kapoor.

GG is talking about defamation, but it is yet unclear if he has condemned it:

> “I will definitely file a defamation case against them. You can't tarnish someone's image just like that, if you don't have the proof. I have never given a negative statement against anyone so far in my election campaigning,” said Gambhir, speaking to ANI.

https://www.thequint.com/elections/atishi-aap-offensive-pamphlets-bjp-gautam-gambhir

EDIT2: It is well within possibility that someone associated with AAP did it as a false flag operation. Whether or not Kejriwal & Co knew of it or agreed to it, is in question as much as whether anyone from BJP or Cong or any other group did it. https://twitter.com/GautamGambhir/status/1126428838588608512

> My Challenge no.2 @ArvindKejriwal @AtishiAAP.

> I declare that if its proven that I did it, I will withdraw my candidature right now. If not, will u quit politics? Gambhir looks stupid and has a punchable face I'm sorry, in the age of WhatsApp, I'm inclined to believe this is either AAP or Congress's dirty work or a random chutiya. BJP IT Cell has mastered WhatsApp propoganda and this would be too risky for their party workers to distribute. Anyway here are Gauti's ramblings

This is the real reason, not caste. The real reason RJD don't want to support him is that he might become the leader lalu wants his son tejaswini to become.  The credit for making him such a political phenomenon goes entirely to the BJP. Congrats to them on shooting themselves in the foot. He is contesting from which seat in Bihar ? He may still win.

Don't get me wrong I've been here when it was at 70k. It used to be the place I felt home. 
With the amount of people joining in. 

Aur ye drama aur shuru ho gya. 

It was fun while it lasted. It's so hot out there that I kill time in office till 8 pm before leaving for home. Otherwise I'd be soaked in sweat by the time I reach home. What do I gift my parents on their 25th wedding anniversary? They are into collecting antique items, home decor stuffs. Been thinking for 2 days about the Uber driver who gave me 1 star rating for no apparent reason.
~~Can imagine how bad rejection from a girl would feel like.~~

Edit : don't want downvotes My credit card is blocked for suspicious use and SBI girl I talked to who didn't helped me at all on phone had Really pretty voice.  me and my friend was waiting in a long queue for billing in  a supermarket and there were 3 girls infront of us. My friend started making these lame remarks like, calling out each and everything that they were billing. Even the sanitary napkins. He even said "" I will take the ebony, you take the other one ""(facepalm). the girls were giggling. I didn't like the comments and I tried to change the topic. After we were out of there, I told him what he did wasn't cool. He turned this around, and accused me of taking things too seriously. He was saying even the girls loved it (we both are not even good-looking). 
I felt humiliated tbh. Idk I'm still confused about that.

"After IRS, Modi govt wants to forcibly retire IAS, IPS officers, review tainted ones monthly",99,c3r04o,https://theprint.in/india/governance/after-irs-modi-govt-wants-to-forcibly-retire-ias-ips-officers-review-tainted-ones-monthly/253190/,46,,Imti01," Civil service cadre cant be retired easily unless you have a corruption charge  but 

Now a days giving a fake corruption charge and then making a cbi inquiry is a piece of cake 

&#x200B;

Jokes aside there are some very corrupt IAS/IPS and IRS. Most of them have property worth of crores backed by political leaders . The income tax dept is a heaven for bribes for these public servants . Most of them are batch mates and scratches each other backs. That should be something done by a non-partisan authority. The way this operated would be rife for abuse even if Modi has the best of intentions. What's stopping future prime ministers using the same excuse to force out bureaucrats who don't want to be Yes Men? Plus considering the incompetence of most ministers and misguided beliefs about Neo liberalism, what's most likely to happen is that instead of bureaucrats who put people over results will get forced out by ""goal oriented"" ones who will throw wrenches into the fabric of Indian society and doom it. What's the inside story? I have seen a bunch of these anti-corruption shit before too. This is what most dictators or authoritative governments all over the world do, get rid of guys who are against you or with the opposition.

Very encouraging that Modiji is on it right after elections. /s Clearing out positions for Sanghies. Tainted officers? You mean who don't blindly follow and support his fascist orders and policies? I'm wondering when kaka's going to turn full duterte and start getting people killed in broad daylight on mere suspicion. Can't wait for Mahant Sharma to scrap my passport because I am a dirty bengali who eats chicken. Very good move, let's put the brightness for progress Depending on how you look at it, this loss of job security might be a good shakeup of an archaic system or might be a warning to line up, obey, and receive patronage.

Either way, if the services had retained a spine/independence, this day wouldn't have come to pass. Kowtowing to whichever dispensation is in power is the hallmark of the service today.

Tourism needs to focus on more than just Taj Mahal. Omfg what is that. Need more info I've visited Kerala more times than I can count and I haven't seen this!!! I'm going back there rightaway. Thanks! When comparing to the world's biggest Sardar Patel statue, this far smaller statue looks magnitudes better in terms of design, texture and aesthetics.. I’ve been there last year. They have a outdoor activities and stuff like rock climbing, rope walk, archery, rifle, paintball etc. Even a nice little lunch too. Really beautiful place. Jatayu was a vulture in the text but I guess they don't look as pretty as eagles.

I mean, we've been lightening up dark skinned gods anyway. statue wahi banega Hidden gem Jesus, this is nice. And here i thought this existed only in WhatsApp forwards! Designed by Rajeev Anchal, filmmaker & sculptor. Some names are just cooler for some reason.  

*Jatayu* just has that oomph & power to it when its said out loud. 

*Bhisma* is also a bit like that. 

Some of these names often gives me goosebumps for some reason, maybe its childhood nostalgia on having grown up with these stories or maybe there is some frequency resonance thing going on with the way these names get pronounced at times. 
 
I wouldn't be surprised with that theory given that Indic Civilization and its legacies are more oral dominant than written hence the importance of sound in relative terms was much more significant than in other places. Wonderful, would love to go there some day. credit to @jonny.melon, aussie travelgrapher on Instagram.

Pretty sure it's wayyyyy cheaper too The [drone view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tkZXLbKVaw) is equally awesome. Copying this from Dhruv Rathee post: 

 The Jatayu Statue in Kerala is all what Statue of Unity isn't -

- Looks amazingly beautiful 
- Built at a cost of only ₹100 crore as an eco-tourism project
- Funded completely by private investors 
- Will recover it's cost in only 5 years
- Jatayu Earth Centre includes Ziplining, Rappeling, Trekking, Wellness Centre, Adventure Park, Cable Car ride to the mountain and a Museum.
- Kerala Govt spent zero money building this r/farpeoplehate This is awesome man. I had no idea despite being a South Indian Will visit this over statue of unity multiple times. Even if there's no entry fee I'll pay for this majestic artwork. I understand that people are not allowed to climb it? Incredible! Wow. Freaking awesome man ! Looks nice than that statue of unity. Give credit to the photographer. This is a photo from @jonny.melon account. Ye Rss ne bnaya h kya? Did that .. did that eagle just pulled a quick one on us ? And how come I getting to know this now!? How did you get there? That's amazing Proof that Assassin's had their HQ in India too. Beautiful Majestic AF Wow What time this was built? I went to Kerala but never saw this... Next time, definitely going to visit this place! Does anyone else think the face looks similar to Pikachu face? This looks magnificent. What is an earth centre ? Nice That is officially the most badass statue I have ever seen. I saw this one in xda too😂 Wow this is so beautiful. Definitely on my go to list. Thanks! This is incredible! My wife loves birds and we're planning a trip to Kerala later this year. This is definitely on the list of places to go to. Don't lie to me that's the Skyforge. Statue of women safety and honor as per their website. Straight out of assassins creed odyssey!! They could’ve built a cancer research center with that much money /s It looks like the eagle stubbed its toe. Marvelous. [deleted] My nigga jatayu Great stuff. Looks like it was funded privately. Considering that we are comparing it to Sardar's statue, I wonder how we could've got private donors for SoU? Stop wasting money on fucking statues.

Where do you guys get your news from? Is it biased unbiased?",photoreceptic," WhatsApp via network of uncles. Hindu khatre me hai BC /s Indian Express, The Hindu, Reuters [deleted] Newspapers. Indian Express, The Hindu, Mint. 

Online. Project Syndicate, The Wire and Twitter mostly where I follow journalists, academics and experts, newspaper handles, institutions such as World Economic Forum, etc. 

Internet has an ocean of news related content. I have only mentioned some of them here. Pick and choose.

As far as the question regarding being biased or not is concerned, there's hardly any objectivism anywhere in terms of news presentation or analysis. You will gradually realise the same as you read more and more. Don't worry much about it. Do remember to use Google to understand terms, phrases and references which you don't understand when you come across them in news sources. 
Peace What do you want the news source for? As in what do you want the news to give you? For reading the news paper- Mint (more useful for business news. But it has a decent coverage of general news). I used to read Hindu, but it is too left leaning (although there are occasional editorials from right-leaning people). A truly neutral newspaper is TOI (because it doesnt have any depth, it has no leanings. Avoid the editorials at all cost). 

For online, I have subscribed to the Quint and Scroll on YouTube. Quint seems more anti-government. Scroll used to be good, but they havent released any videos for the last 2 months.

India is staring at a water apocalypse,84,c8u9qj,https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/07/article/india-staring-at-a-water-apocalypse/,18,,factchecker01," why worry when we can wed two frogs. Can we call what it actually is? Population Explosion!

Water scarcity -> Population

Pollution -> Population

Low QoL -> Population

Traffic -> Population

I know the population growth has come down by a lot in the last 2 decades, but we still need to think about family planning even in remote parts of India, not just Bangalore and Mumbai. I think some of this fear mongering about apocalypses and such is to distract ordinary people away from the real causes for this, which is simply political and personal apathy to tackle rainwater harvesting on a national scale. 

Once the monsoons come, everyone forgets about this and votes for their politicians according to other preferences. 90% of the people who post on FB about saving water will not look into greywater recycling or rainwater harvesting for their building.

Until we start voting for people who actually have robust infrastructure building plans, this is never going to get fixed. If we can't look past the heavy rainfall and remember the water shortages of only 3 months ago, we aren't going to make any progress in solving this until there's a freak monsoon which fails 100%, which would be terrifying. >The sugar mills have a vice-like grip on procurement prices, and connected to them is a host of shady co-operative banks. They combine to ensure policies that are inimical to a water-sustainable future.           




For fucking sugar. Let the politicians keep collecting money. One day a mob pissed off due to water shortage will teach them money is worth nothing if there is nothing to spend it on I can personally attest to water scarcity issue in India, around a week ago I (and everyone in my locality) started getting water at very low pressure. Turns out the the ground water level has fallen so low that there simply isn't enough water present underground. (The locality gets its water from bore well). And this is at a place where there was never any water shortage issue. So, after the droughts in central India even the rest of the country is slowly heading towards the point of severe water shortage. I remember reading an article that said that Punjab's underground water will run out after 20 or so years. (Agriculture there is heavily dependent upon tube wells). A country cannot sustain an economy without food.

We need to realize that water scarcity isn't something we will face in future, we are facing it right now. Why is Nehru not making dams 

Why is Nehru making statues Dark times ahead Maybe you guys should establish a helpdesk India should build a few powerplants that can transform seawater into drinkable water. It is expensive, but better then the alternative. Expect droughts to get worse over time",Political,2019-07-04 05:58:53

>Walmart has suffered other setbacks. During the course of its  Flipkart acquisition and soon after, it lost the co-founders of its new  purchase. Their know-how and connections would have helped the U.S.  retailer better navigate this latest regulatory wrinkle.

Isn't common knowledge that they were forced to resign.  There was a video by quint warning CEOs and founders of what happens when their companies get acquired by MNC's What is the point of the PM traveling the world courting investment if once these MNC's are invested they are treated like this? I'm wondering what will happen when these companies will start funding campaigns against such ruling parties? सब का साथ, पर अंबानी का विकास 😁 This is the same story.

 Kaka again in international media. Proud! How long can we sustain this damaging government? I hope the shame and distrust do not stay forever! This Modi is the biggest threat to India. Guys on the flip side , the govt has just clarified the existing law. Both the companies knew from day 1 that FDI in marketplace is allowed, foreign companies can not own inventories in multiple brand retail. 

They were simply exploiting the loophole or violating the law that is another question. Now that loophole has been closed, they can not come and cry hoarse that policy and rules are being changed at whim.

They both are foreign firms. We can not hand over entire emerging sector to them on platter. We need to have our own Desi e-commerce firms, otherwise in a decade or so when online shopping goes mainstream billions of dollars will be flowing out of India.  India probably never had such a partisan PM in its entire history.  Most people here don't realise that ambani babu will be served regardless of who has the power in the center. congress ya bjp, sab ambani ki haath me hai.  Predatory pricing is not a good thing in the long run for the consumers or for small and growing companies. They will not survive against these behemoths without some regulatory protection. Of course the same laws should apply to Ambani's venture ... What we need to realize is that the problem are both the industrialists and the government. Ambani genuinely wouldn't care who the person in power is. For him it's about paying the person in power. Let's not forget that reliance industries became what it is today during the years of various Congress governments.

I am not a Modi supporter, I hate that guy. But we also need to see is the bigger picture, whichever government comes in charge is going to be in the rich industrialists pocket.

\> The tighter rules, aimed at protecting small traders, may end up benefiting the country’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani

\> The rules now bar Amazon and Flipkart Online Services PTE from owning inventory and require them to treat all vendors equally

\> a huge advantage to homegrown companies, including Ambani’s new venture.

\> Both Amazon and Walmart will have to reduce cash-back payments and discounts — a sore point for smaller sellers, who accuse the pair of predatory pricing.

Can't rationalise this article whatsoever. On one hand it says it's a populist move aimed at appeasing smaller retailers, on other hand it (also?) says that it's aimed at benefitting Reliance specifically? Someone please explain, how is it a bad thing? This policy change prevents amazon and flipkart from selling products from brands in which they have equity stake. This gave them an unfair advantage. The policy change now creates a level playing field. Even ambani will have to adhere to these changes. So how can we say this change was particularly made to benefit ambani?

&#x200B;

Punjab & Haryana disagree. >Indian Culture Is All About Non-Violence

Lol. That's a fucking lie. Violence is a recurring theme in Indian and Asian cultures in general. It starts with parents beating up their kids at an early age. 

I've seen parents hit their kids for falling down and getting dust on their clothes. And then threatening to slap them if they don't stop crying. The same reason we are the 2nd must populous country in the world ie Ignorance and lack of reasoning. But we are improving, albeit very slowly. People commenting about the violent Indian history, think about Vikings. They were just a tribe of ill organized tribes that relied on looting and raping other people while we had fucking proper cities and civilization. We had a big lead over them and look at us now. Their climate sucks still but a majority of us would leap at chance of immigrating there.


I think this dog eat dog mentality is because our majority of our population is fucking poor and fucking big and it now fucking knows it's been shafted all this while. [WhatApp is not the problem](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/09/whatsapp/571276/) Yeah, animal sacrifice, sati pratha, caste system, child marriage, dowry etc all are non violent tradition of Indian culture. 🙄 Serious Question: Do we believe that people are inherently good and act bad when left with no other option or are people inherently bad and act good only out of fear and lack of a better option ? Ladhega India, tabhi toh baddhega india. Our entire freedom movement was based on Non-violence. But look at these clowns now. The views are of my own understanding, based on texts I read about the history.      
    

The nonviolence nature of Indian culture was quite new and was promoted by the early statesmen of the republic.   
To pacify and lead the fragile country into the modern world.   
   
In real, our country folks are rife with hatred, hating their own fellow men along castes, creed, color and religion.    
    
Whatever the statesmen of earlier times did, was systematically destroyed by the likes of RSS and its Sangh parivar subjects. Very elaboratly through lies, bigotry, fake nationalism and cooked up history.    
    
Now these forces had legitimized the violence by validating certain safron terrorists.   
    
>Many argue that this pacifist mindset allowed invaders to conquer it with extreme brutality and firmly establish themselves within its borders.  
    
In real, the society then must have been so fragmented, with a lot of infighting and saturated with oppression, so it was easy for the invaders. I guess a lot of the folks actually welcomed the invading armies to escape from the caste atrocities of then period. Like how some Rajputs partnered with the Mughals.   
    
It probably repeated again when the Europeans arrived.  
A lot of soldiers hired by the East India company in Madras, in its early days were from the oppressed communities, and alsk Mahar favoured by the company's Bombay army.   
    
All these divisions and hatred are coming back and fueled by the Sangh politics. They are stoking everything from caste to regionalism.   
    
**It's effect in Tamil Nadu**     
    
There are so many fake online profiles in Tamil Twitter world, with caste names and generic rural tamil names, which nobody uses in modern world. All these Twitter handles tweet about caste pride and their likes for violent hindutva.   
   
They are systematically stoking violent caste pride among each community (ex. Veera vanniyan, Veera Paraiyan, Nadanda Nadar) by adding a bigoted pride to their caste identities.   
    
The Jallikattu protests of Tamil Nadu was initially promoted by some of these Twitter and Facebook profiles, which showed heavy RSS influence (likes Desi cow, Ayurveda, Faux pride), just to divert Tamils from the political instability post Jayalalitha's death.   
Later it turned against them and also reignited the Tamil rationalist groups.   
   
The rabid Hitler loving politics of Seeman is also its byproduct. Though tries to act like anti-BJP, his Tamil Nationalism politics is textbook copy of RSS's violent Hindutva.    
And his group never spoke anything against the the ruling ADMK, while heavily attacking Tamil rationalist and anticaste groups. He calls to revoke caste pride and revive Tamil nationalism. And successfully created a rabid casteist followers around him.  
    
Dravidian parties has good success in separating Caste pride from Tamil nationalism, people here don't even use caste surnames. And Seeman calls it a disgrace.   
    
India that we knew and thought about is dead and never coming back, atleast for 2 decades. I just hope that we don't go deep into regression. *Aaram se baat kar...aaram se baat kar nahi to...*\*grabs collar\* Indians are violent only against themselves,  not to outsiders.

Pak is ex girlfriend / divorce who took share and begging for more. Not all the people are  **Violent** . In fact, people in India are also popular for their friendliness and affection. It is just because of some Non-Violent people, you cannot blame to the whole country.

Nahi bhai, from the later Rig Vedic times, Indian culture has been more about suppression and discrimination than anything else. India has change since independence andar ka janawar bahar aa gaya hai aab...at that time we were united against common enemy brits, ab koi enemy nahi hai apna frustration nikalnay ko apas main ek doosray ki gand marr rahey hain...hindu vs muslim, upper caste vs lower caste, bihari vs marathi etc I don't think anyone's in the conversation even knows what they are talking about and getting angsty over. 1. Sexual frustration >Indian Culture Is All About Non-Violence

BIGGEST LIE OF THE CENTURY! ""Indian Culture"" is super diverse and most importantly, non-violent aspects come from Jain&Buddhist influences.  The only reason why Hindus are Pro-Vegetarian(well, certain North Indian states anyway) is because of Buddhist influences. NOWHERE in the original Vedic literature is non-vegetarian diet shown to be a bad thing. .

Also, the reason why Jainsim is such a fringe religion is because Indians(and humans in general) are selfish, violent greedy assholes who gravitate towards ideologies that compliment&justify violence. ""India is nonviolent"" such statements look good in books. In reality, it's not true. The author answers his own question the reasons are threefold, 

1. Overpopulation which leads to
2. higher demand for services (private providers or state sanctioned providers both of which are without any accountability) which leads to
3.   frustrated end users, since obtaining any service is an exercise in determining availability

&#x200B;

I see this getting only worse as time progresses, not a single political party has any answer of how to reduce population or of how to improve services especially state sanctioned ones. My advice is emigrate sooner rather then later. Because India is a well functioning anarchy . Ahimsa Paramo Dharma.
Dharmo Himsa Tathaiva Cha.

Roughly translates as “non-violence is the ultimate dharma. So is violence in service of dharma.” The Indian culture was about Non-violence but not with the our countrymen. It is with the outsider or foreigners. We ourselves treat our own countrymen with little or no respect and phrase Atithi Devo Bhava made the outsiders really the God. 

You know why India never invaded any country in past 1000 years because we have slave mentality. We love to lick shoes of those outsiders who came invading us whether they be Mughals, British or other Afghans. Our own kings helped them win, just to satisfy their ego or revenge. And if you wanna see the difference, go to local restaurant where foreigners also come. And see the kind of treatment they get over you. Even some of restaurants in Kasol, Goa or Uttarakhand, they have no Indian policies.

PR politics and the timing of the J&K announcement.,3,cn7nmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cn7nmq/pr_politics_and_the_timing_of_the_jk_announcement/,9,"I just have to comment that the timing of the J&K annoucment was extremely clever considering the amount of pressure the powers that be were getting for the disgusting rape culture. 

Just a day before the whole debacle, it seemed the protests and critique of the government was certainly picking up major velocity in not just internet circles like this sub but also mass media. And then they announce this and it's almost like everyone forgot in one day the reality of rape culture that persisits and even grows as per some records, in our country. They effectively dodged quite a bullet and a lot of bad PR in one fell swooop.

I would like to believe that this is mere co incedence but the teachings of Edward Bernays would say otherwise. The current party in power has a track record of using such techniques and methods and are even credited with popularising this sort of campaigning after the last elections, including using many modern day tools and technologies to further enhance the impact and effectiveness of these methods, such as those, but not limited too,  that have been recently brought to the public eye in the documentary ""The Great Hack"". The expeneses of the party also reveal a major chunk of their finances being used with respect to PR politics and it's methods and techniques. There are also strong allegations and reports of them heavily influencing and interfering with the media, that seem to be systematically being silenced in the most suspicious of circumstances more often than not by unknown characters. There are also strong links between the controlling shares of major media outlets and political parties, along with sting operations revelaing how the biggest news outlets such as TOI and even major celebrities charging crores of rupess for a certain degree of control over what is printed/reported and what is not and in what manner that were systematically repressed and hidden from the public eyes, again in the most suspicious of circumstances. Below is also an extract from a recent interview by Ravish Kumar just to give one example Bernays techniques in action being confirmed by a credible personality  -

>**What do you think happened to the Indian media in the last four years?**  
>  
>Unfortunately, the media have been serving only the powers that be and generating controversies that serve their purpose. \*\*\*There are diversions being created to take attention away from serious issues.\*\*\*The Aligarh Muslim University controversy is a case in point. It is an engineered controversy and so was the controversy around JNU ...   

In summary I strongly believe that this not merely a coincedence of the Engineering of Consent techniques and methods being applied in practice, but rather it is being done so very deliberately, in this case to avoid the very obvious pressure and heat the government was facing due to the rape culture that they would have been forced to do something about and speak against, including and mainly to avoid upsetting a lot of political relationships that they have built if they chose to actually speak against and take actions against the powers that be in UP, a very important state when it comes to national elections considering the number of seats and votes they have in parliment.

> “As I had earlier observed in Punjab villages, the Dalits did not wish to work on land with cultivating farmers primarily for social and political reasons. Working with farmers implied accepting their domination and power. By refusing to work on land, Dalits expressed their dissent against the traditional structure of patron-client ties. Even if it meant cycling to town for casual labour for no higher a wage or secure income, a Dalit did not like working on land.”

Alert in Tamil Nadu after intel of Lashkar terrorists' intrusion,22,cuavet,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/alert-in-tamil-nadu-after-intel-of-lashkar-terrorists-intrusion/articleshow/70798958.cms,1,,magicalmakx," A few [*Hindu Munani* terrorists](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hindu-munnani-members-held-assaulting-pilgrims-walking-velankanni-church-107603) were arrested recently by the TN police as they sought to create communal disturbance by attacking a christian group going to a christian holy place. 

I've always said this, religious fundamentalists of the opposing side always work in tandem initially because it benefits them. Here the *Sanghis* are stoking the flames to start communal riots, while the *Jihadis* will come with their fear-mongering and ISI trained militants to add to it. Once both community are polarized, it becomes a fertile breeding ground for both to recruit new members and further their agenda. 

[Note that Coimbatore in TN is a specific target for both the *Sanghis* and *Jihadis*](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-alert-in-coimbatore-following-intel-about-terrorist-intrusion/article29226339.ece). The *Sanghis* were able to successfully start a riot here more than a decade back, which ensured that the *Jihadis* were able to radicalise a local muslims organisation to a terrorist outfit (the *Al-Umma*) which proceeded to terrorise the city with bomb blasts. And ofcourse, the BJP reaped rich political rewards and was abe to win a few elections from here (one of the few places in TN from where they could win). But ofcourse, this time the Modi ""wave"" seemed to skip Coimbatore, and the BJP couldn't win this constituency.

So if you live in Coimbatore be very careful - while there is no indication that the AIADMK, a political puppet of the BJP has succumbed to the RSS's ideology, who knows how much pressure Amit Shah may put on them ...",Political,2019-08-23 16:12:25

Rahul Gandhi,40,c8ori6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c8ori6/rahul_gandhi/,18,"Ever since he joined politics he has been mocked around, called names, questioned on his capabilities.

I myself have partaken in all of the above. 

But the way he has handled his decision in last 2 weeks, compelled me to write; that he did finally showed maturity, ownership and grace in his demeanor.

Not a pappu anymore, I feel sad for him, like he was forced to perform at something and was looked at with higher expectations. Setting him up for failure. He should have been given or he should have taken a junior ministry >cabinet post before becoming the PM candidate

&#x200B;

Last names may always not be helpful, they can sometime lead to over expectations and set up your failure due to immense pressure it builds up!

&#x200B;

Anyhoo, kudos to RaGa at least he made his exit graceful. Hoping for a stronger congress, stronger opposition, stronger India.",MadGo," &#x200B;

Ever since he joined? He was a dream boy and hero for almost 7-8 years during UPA. I had girls in my class Orgasming at him. I personally was awed for a fair amount of time. I met several people who met him personally and everyone used to tell me that he was quite sincere in his efforts and what he talks. I think he is a good guy but never a leader.  I find him far better than most of other politicians and he has grown a lot. This is something I saw on twitter and I kinda agree.-

Rahul is like a lion who has been raised his entire life within the artifical safety of a zoo, who was suddenly released into the wild and expected to survive in the political jungle against lions who were faster, hungrier and more brutal. Never had a chance. Just a name. I have utmost respect for him....he kept his integrity and dignity which is more than what i can say for the supreme leader spewing venom at his dead parents. I think he has shown exemplary courage, so to speak, in last month or so. I am not saying he was doomed from the start, but when one is the scion of The Gandhi family one ought to realise his privileges and responsibilities. I could go on writing about what went wrong but nevertheless, 'der aaye durust aaye'. To be honest, I thought it was a sham when he stated he wanted to resign. But now that he's gone through with it, in my eyes he has grown in stature.

I would not still however write off his failures. He had enough time to make a difference to Congress, but he was not able to affect much, whatever the reason. As a result Congress suffered, but I think India suffered more. >He should have been given or he should have taken a junior ministry >cabinet post before becoming the PM candidate

&#x200B;

He was not even the PM candidate. He was just a 'star campaigner'. Congress had no PM candidate in 2014 and 2019. Nope. He had enough time to prove himself or get out of the way.

Cobrapost Sting Reveals Celebs Taking Money To Promote Political Parties,240,as8wwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/as8wwo/cobrapost_sting_reveals_celebs_taking_money_to/,64,"Edit: [The videos playlist](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?reload=9&list=PLtIitJsHQm64G-lHSe4tuutWWJe7XQfAs)

[X-Post from Bollywood]

[Link of the article](https://www.cobrapost.com/blog/Press-Expose-Operation-Karaoke/1414)

>	An investigation by Cobrapost has exposed 36 Bollywood celebrities ready to promote a political party for money by posting favourable messages on their social media accounts to help create a favorable environment in the run-up to 2019 elections. Among these celebs are actors, singers, stand-up comedians and dancers: Noted playback singers, Abhijeet Bhattacharya, Kailash Kher, Mika Singh and Baba Sehgal; actors Jackie Shroff, Shakti Kapoor, Vivek Oberoi, Sonu Sood, Amisha Patel, Mahima Chaudhry, Shreyas Talpade, Puneet Issar, Surendra Pal, Pankaj Dheer and his son Nikitin Dheer, Tisca Chopra, Deepshikha Nagpal, Akhilendra Mishra, Rohit Roy, Rahul Bhat, Salim Zaidi, Rakhi Sawant, Aman Verma, Hiten Tejwani and spouse Gauri Pradhan, Evelyn Sharma, Minissha Lamba, Koena Mitra, Poonam Pandey, Sunny Leonne; comedians Raju Srivastava, Sunil Pal, Rajpal Yadav, Upasana Singh, Krushna Abhishek and Vijay Ishwarlal Pawar; and choreographer Ganesh Acharya and dancer Sambhavana Seth. This is almost who’s who of the entertainment industry, both film and TV.

>	While we saw all these celebs succumbing to the lure of money and agreeing to indulge in this unethical and unlawful practice, there were some notable exceptions, though. When we approached Vidya Balan, Arshad Warsi, Raza Murad and Saumya Tandon with our proposition, these celebs chose to go by their conscience and straightaway refused to play ball.",i_Killed_Reddit," props to Vidya Balan, Arshad Warsi, Raza Murad and Saumya Tandon 

I would've totally taken the money like a piece of shit.  Shakti kapoor demanded 1 cr to tweet .....without even having an twitter account. Amazing balls > Sunny Leonne

of all, this hurt most  Most of these people are has-beens and attention seeking celebrities. Wouldn't expect them to have even a shred of integrity... Props to the people who declined. > The party in question was, in most of the cases, the Bharatiya Janata  Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress Party in some  cases. The names of political parties were used, in good faith and  public interest, for narrative purpose only, and this is not an insinuation of their actual involvement in the practice. The  investigation was made to expose the celebs willing to endorse a  political agenda in return for monetary gains.  

&#x200B; Arsha Warsi is such an underrated actor. So all the washed-up and one hit celebs.  Like opening a can of worms  Sunny Leonne is a game changer  [deleted] Kailash kher wtf bruh no. SMH. Kailash Kher shocked me. But Tisca Shopra was a mega shocker. She is the hottest Indian woman in age grouo 35 - 50 I have ever seen. Acting skills are superb as shown in Taare Zameen Par. I used to wish how cool it would be if she was my mother.

Now before you people negatively judge her, let's understand that her husband is a pilot in Air India. So it means a fixed monthly salary, not endless profits. She probably lives in a circle where her friends marry to rich business men while she feels  insecure that her future is all about living a stable and simple life. Also, she just agreed to promote Aam Aadmi Party indirectly. Its not illegal. Not unethical. Its the problem of foolish people in India that they choose to listen to some celebrity that has neither knowledge of Indian political setup nor any integrity or past experience in struggle for human rights.


 For the umpteenth time! Stop fucking paying attention to these two bit hacks! Stop hanging on to every word that comes out of their mouth. THEY DO NOT REPRESENT ANY OF YOU! THEY LIVE IN THEIR IVORY TOWERS WHILST YOU AND ME GRIND THROUGH OUR DAILY SHIT! Guess what? They're trying to make their living and you and your dad and your friends and families are too! There's literally no difference between them and us! There's just no fucking reason to worship them like Gods amongst humans just because they say a few cheesy lines and titillate their audience! When big stars like srk and Amitabh do endorsements for money, served guests in ambanis wedding..no surprise what these B listers want to do for money. Its all about money  Why they r not showing this clip's on news channel's 😐😐 >This is almost who’s who of the entertainment industry, both film and TV.

Are they, though? Any part that I must watch? Does anyone have the videos of Vidya Balan, Arshad Warsi and Raza Murad? Can't find them on Youtube. Why isn't the opposition doing this?
 Cobrapost is the New Cancer in India. 

\- We all know most celebs will do anything for money.

\- When they endorse shampoo, soaps.. do we actually believe that those celebs use the same? No!

\- For any political party, It's a good strategy to spread good things about their party via celebs, media etc. even if there's nothing good about the political party. That's not a bad thing. "" It's a bad thing if we believe them, It's an individual's job to find the truth and not be a cobrapost puppet. ""

\- If you all consider this an ""Expose"", It's Okay. I consider it a ""Cancer"" may be because I personally knew all this things way before so it's not an ""expose"" for me. 

&#x200B;

Pandering to religious masses while forgetting what the government should actually do. Mamta's iftar party was before elections...agar ye election ke pahle hota to is pr bhi bada bawal hota... remember desh khatre me h Pakistan pr nuclear attacks and all that on TV debates but what about them now they are all gone.

Iss desh mein har koi politically motivated rahta...yahan bawal karne se abhi unhe kuch nahi milega. both are wrong. Because logic is our STREANH Because it was before elections? It can't get more obvious than that. Mamta is not clean. She's like Modi but for Muslims.

Both suck big time. Because that's how BJP wants to show Mamta's image

Basically, whatever works for Hindutva = good >The paradox was apparent. Jahan, a Muslim, had indeed upheld India’s vision of secularism by participating in the festival celebrated by people professing a faith that she had not been born into. But when Mamata Banerjee did the same thing, attending iftar dinners to mark the end of the day’s fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramzan, her critics accused her of “minority appeasement”.

.

>The BJP veteran’s impact was much deeper than simply making prime ministers. **Advani** changed India’s political culture, root and branch. He **popularised a neologism that came to powerfully define Indian politics: “pseudo-secularism”.** According to Advani, **India’s secular politicians** at the time **indulged in “minority appeasement” and neglected the Hindu majority.** This formulation had **little to do with reality, given high poverty levels among Indian Muslims, their poor access to education and low representation in government jobs.** But, nevertheless, this **definition** of “pseudo-secularism” **played a vital role in shaping the BJP’s ideology** and, given the party’s subsequent popularity, India’s politics.

>Among its other **consequences, this formulation of pseudo-secularism discouraged displays of Muslim symbols in India’s political space.** Famously, during his time **as Gujarat chief minister, Modi refused to put on a Muslim skull cap. “My job is to respect all communities, respect the values of all communities but I have to accept my own values,” Modi explained. “I live with my values.”**

>This argument **seems reasonable – until one realises that Modi has often been pictured wearing headgear from places as far away from his native Gujarat as Nagaland. The problem, it seems, related only to things identified as Muslim**.

.

>In a country with significant levels of illiteracy, **political ideas are often communicated using actions rather than words. This would include politicians wearing regional attire or participating in public rituals to signal their concern for a particular social group.** This **tradition** of conveying political ideas using forms of dress in fact, **goes right back to Mohandas Gandhi, who, despite being a lawyer educated in England, consciously adopted the loincloth of Indian peasants.**

>Hindutva understood this feature of Indian secularism – and sought to dismantle it. **The claim that its opponents were guilty of pseudo-secularism was not an attempt to separate church and state or banish religion from the public sphere**. In fact, **deploying religion in the public sphere was critical to the BJP’s Hindu nationalism. Instead, the party’s project was to get rid of every religion other than Hinduismfrom the public sphere.**

 This has been alleged several times in the past and has consistently been dismissed as both of those sections are voiceless and powerless by and large. I forgot, but there was thread on this sub few days ago about People not being able get there name in voting list........ Could somebody shed light on that matter. Pasting my comment here for visiblity:

without looking at full data, you cannot make that statement.

Dalits and Muslims are also the economically weak. You need to see the financial statistic of the voters in this list. Maybe they are mostly poor, in that case it's no wonder that 17lakh are dalit and 10 lakh are muslim.

Also, Dalits are being seen as a major vote bank of BJP (they handed BJP a 70/72 seats in UP and elsewhere). Even the president of India is a dalit (IIRC).

Electoral bonds may be opaque to the citizens, but it is transparent to investigation agencies like Lokpal, such agencies know exactly who donated to which party. And also these bonds are better than anonymous cash donations below 20,000, that were prevalent earlier. Most political parties used to get more than 75% of their party fund from these so called anonymous cash, which has now reduced due to these bonds.

What do the people of Delhi think about the Kejriwal government's work?,216,bktwxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bktwxp/what_do_the_people_of_delhi_think_about_the/,111,"When he came into power in 2015, it was a really huge surprise for me that someone won with such a huge majority.

I used to live in New Delhi at the time but I wasn't very aware of the political happenings around me. The only thing I remember was that the electricity bills got very, very cheap.

I moved out some time later and have since not been following the government's work.

How according to a resident of New Delhi, is the current government?",-GodofHellfire-," Hey, I live in Delhi & I believe that I'm Qualified to answer this question.

Water is free for any house consuming less than 20kl per month. The limit has been calculated just right for a family of 4. It incentivizes people to save water! 

Earlier my family used to pay somewhere around ₹600-₹1000 per month. Now we don't pay anything! Plus, we strive to save every drop of water. It is not like we are using more of it.

Also, electricity bill waiver/subsidy is a Godsend.  The electricity rates in Delhi are some of the lowest in the country. Same math applies here as well. We try to save as much as we can in order to stay below the 400 limit every month.

They are working pretty hard towards primary education in Delhi Schools. Source- A relative works as a teacher educator, educating govt school teachers. The ""hardwork"" reflects in the recently announced class 12 results in which Govt. Schools fared better than private schools!(in terms of overall pass percentage)  That is probably a first, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

Also, the moholla clinic scene looks pretty good. I haven't visited myself, but those who have visited (from my social circle) have nothing bad to say about it.

The govt. also  conducted permanent  recruitment exams for TGT, PGT & Primary teachers working on  contractual basis in Delhi Govt. Schools. So there's that too. Fully approve of what he's done. The progress made in education and healthcare especially, has been really great which really explains why he's constantly under attack by bjp and cong politicians. They're just eager to make his image go down, as he aint ready to do that himself (unlike most politicians)

Another thing about those mohalla clinics as i guess they acquire centre stage whenever discussing about progress in health, they're really something. The nearest hospital to me is apollo and 90% of the things that go for about 500-2k in their pharmacy, go for literally 10-14 rs in the *mohalla clinic just in front of that hospital.*
Like forget the price, just aesthetics or meaning of setting up shop just in the front (*hey fuck you, see my prices*) makes it godly xD

Edit: also, most MLAs are reachable by their phone numbers (lol actually) AAP has been great in Delhi. Amazing how they actually managed to deliver on their campaign promise of reducing electricity bills by 50% and providing 700 litres of free water to every house in Delhi. The improvement in education and healthcare has been phenomenal. Already knew that they weren't fucking around when the party announced that they would be allocating [a whopping 26% of their Budget](https://indianexpress.com/article/education/delhi-budget-2019-education-gets-highest-allocation-26-5601221/) to education. Delhi's government schools, in fact, [are now outperforming private schools](https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/delhi-government-schools-outperform-private-schools-in-academics/story-yDcSrRyaKcg1IKycdZ8jON.html) in academics and infra. A major reason for their success, IMO, has been the fact that they have competent and educated leaders at the top. The reforms in education, for example, were headed by Atishi, who herself is a an Oxford-grad and a Rhodes scholar. Good work The big thing about the AAP govt. is not the big picture rhetoric but their commitment to fixing basic things on the ground: education, electricity, water-supply, basic healthcare. And on all counts their work kind of speaks for itself. 

* Loadshedding has gone down vastly in the past 5-6 years, and electricity bills are quite manageable. On top of that you get 50% off on your bill if you keep consumption below 400 units, which is a pretty killer deal.

* They did the same thing with water, making it free below a certain threshold (20,000 ltrs) of use which not only keeps in free for low-income families, but also incentives middle and high-income families to use it conservatively. No sewer charges either.

* Their mohalla clinics were a big hit being an easy, cheap way to access healthcare. General community health has improved a lot because earlier people used to just carry their ailments, hoping they'd get better because they couldn't afford to sacrifice their very limited time and money to go to some place like AIIMS until it became very serious. I'm from a well off family and even I have visited a nearby clinic which was conveniently located. They are really good, and well managed, not the scam types set up by the BJP/Congress and their ilk right before elections to score some political points.

* Education has seen HUGE improvement. AAP systematically did a lot of overhaul work, tightened up the system, introduced remedial classes and pumped resources to strengthen the govt. schooling system. Delhi govt schools boast the highest pass percentage in the country (87%+ as of this year) and the Kendriya Vidyalayas are easily on-par with mid-level private schools in terms of quality of teachers and attention to academic development (KVs had a 98.5% passing rate this year). AAP has really walked the talk in this department.

--

All of this work has been done by AAP with the fraction of the power that state govts usually have, given the special NCT status of New Delhi, because of which they don't have any jurisdiction in matters related to police, law and order, municipal services and the jurisdiction of courts which are under the LG/Center. This special status has interfered a lot with their work. 
For instance when AAP had their landslide victory in the 2015, the Ministry of Home Affairs very conveniently removed jurisdiction of the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) from the Delhi government, as a result they haven't been able to tackle corruption, bribery, collusion etc among public officials as effectively as they promised. This reduced scope and arbitrary relocation of power in many instances has led to a lot of inefficiency and constant bickering with the Centre/LG which has hampered a lot of work. Overall still, I'm still a huge fan of whatever they have managed to accomplish so far. I don't deal much with government but a sarkari school near my house went from 1 story to a 3 storey building and has a new basketball court, so there's that Despite all the propaganda and vendetta against them, they have done a great job. 

I can see BJP and Congress getting annihilated if Delhi govt gets more constitutional powers. 

I hope people of Delhi give AAP 7/7 in this election. Pleased with his work. He does not have much power but uses little power he has to improve education, healthcare etc. Not a Delhiite, but mightily impressed with the amount of importance that they are giving  to education    ..

https://youtu.be/72kwFyLT8wI Right now my water bill is 0. It used to be around 250 per month which might not seem much but is 250 rupees saved every month. Not from Delhi, so wanted to ask a question. Pollution has been a major concern in Delhi. What plans has the government undertaken to keep pollution under control (I know about the odd even rule but is it still exercised?) He did a great job in education sector. 10/10 would want a leader like that in UP. Before the AAP water scheme my mum had to wake up 6 in the morning and fight to get our tanks filled with water. No more of that shit these days :) As usual, a mixed bag. People always miss the context in these things, and it all ends up being either hero worship, or blame game.

&#x200B;

AAP came to power in Jan 2015, but their 67/70 win was misleading. Delhi had elections in Dec. 2013, where BJP won 31 seats out of 70 with a vote share of 33%. AAP got 28 seats with 29.5% votes, and Congress got 8 seats. AAP formed a govt with Congress support, but it fell through after 49 days. President's rule was imposed in Feb 2014.

&#x200B;

After 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP came into power, and installed a puppet Governor. They quickly realized that if they ruled Delhi through proxy, they would not be answerable to the people. They enjoyed unelected power till Jan 2015, when they were forced to finally conduct elections again. (Sidenote: BJP is following the same strategy in J&K right now. There's Governor's rule, and opposition parties are clamoring for elections. However, BJP doesn't care.)

&#x200B;

I mentioned earlier that AAP's win in 2015 elections was misleading. It's because BJP got only 3 seats this time around, but they still had a vote share of 32.3%. That's right, a loss of vote share of 0.7% resulted in a loss of  29 seats.

&#x200B;

Now to the performance of AAP. First, the good things: Education and healthcare. Everyone on this thread has covered these 2 aspects amply, but I'll still commend AAP's work in these 2 areas. The Mohalla Clinics are a boon, and the rashtriya pratibha vidyalayas are top notch. Despite what some might say, I feel the electricity and water infrastructure has held up pretty well. The incentive on saving water is a great move.

&#x200B;

However, AAP has a number of issues as well, foremost of which is their leader. I'm sorry but Arvind Kejriwal comes across as a petulant child. His dharnas and dramas are tiring, and frankly, off-putting. His behavior has led to a number of good leaders parting ways with AAP, which is a shame. And I get it, Delhi is not a full-state. But there's a lot that can be done within the powers that they have right now. I'm slightly disappointed at their lack of focus on infrastructure in the city, and having worked with them for a while, leader worship in AAP is only slightly less than that in BJP.

&#x200B;

So yes, it's been a mixed bag. And yet they lost all the seats. The so claled nationalists who selected a bigoted cricketer with no administrative experience over an Oxford graduate don't deserve her. Thanks Bhakts. I am so a AAP supporter but let me tell you the truth, people who properly getting what Aap has done for them is very less because more then 70% simply don't care . Half of them will vote for money and rest of them are simply bhakt who think Modi will change the country. And the 30 % who know about right and wrong ,20% vill vote and rest will not. 

There was a time when main source of news was NDTV for my family now it's zee news and india tv. I still watch it online.


They are even ready to support Manoj Tiwari,that retard singer who didn't do a single thing for delhi and not even ask a single question in parliament . we need to put this question in the FAQ curious: from where is the Delhi govt managing money to meet the massive water & electricity bill subsidies ?   
or, are they just piling on debt hoping to dump it on a future govt's shoulders ? [deleted] I am a delhite, and i have been living in delhi from past 15 years. 

Kejriwal, in his initial days seemed to have quite a great potential, he made a lott of promises too which seemed realistic. 

But i believe, that the work done my his govt. has been mainly focused on incentivising the water and electricity and a bit of work in the field of education. Which was just enough that a common man in India expects a politician to do, whereas his duties and responsibilities are way more than that. There has been corruption in the VAT department, though there is GST regime now but the VAT department still exists to process the cases of past and refunds of past years, the department will ask for money for everything, else they will openly deny to work. So yes he has done the whitewashing to show to the common man who already has very low expectations from a minister but he has failed to do the repairing work altogether amidst his bigger political ambitions. [deleted] i think because of constitutional boundation  delhi suffers a lot ...it was not evident earlier coz the previous government were not like modi . Whether you are supporter or hater of modi you will admit that last five years any constitutional body(cbi,LG,SC) in India is behaving weirdly . they are behaving like we haven't seen it earlier . so delhi is ruled by an elected representative but final decision lies with center via LG.

i am living(voter) in Delhi for 15 years seen congress and aap both .one things i can say poor people  living in Delhi has benefited from aap but not the entire population.

they have done nothing on traffic , delhi government functioning , security(cctv), too many false promises were made too.

but if i have to name party in delhi BJP = gundagardi , congress = party for lutians and upper class , aap = party trying to woo lower class (juggi jhopri)

and also water+ electricity bill is so much less compared to congress [deleted] chutiya hai sala but the best option in delhi currently [deleted]",Political,2019-05-05 12:41:36

The Left massacre of migrant Hindus in Bengal that was bigger than 2002 & 1984,134,bocdw4,https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/the-left-massacre-of-migrant-hindus-in-bengal-that-was-bigger-than-2002-1984/233691/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app,96,,JaiJawanJaiKisaan," It's funny to see the how the massacre at Morichchanjhappi is being reframed, and re-contextualised as one of migrant 'Hindus.'

&#x200B;

Unlike the partition at the western border, which saw a very hastened, immediate and fast movement of peoples, the eastern border saw very slow, decades spanning migration patterns. This must be seen in historical context.

The Namasudra movement, a dalit political movement, kept the Hindu upper castes out of power by aligning with muslims. And so, the partition worked in the favour of Hindu upper-caste elites, who returned to power in the Hindu-dominated West Bengal, leaving the Dalits without political leverage in either parts. This meant that, the initial wave of migrants into West-Bengal were the landed elites, who took advantage of their connections and family to resettle in Kolkata and in around regions and the marginalised, landless migrants, came in waves, spanning over 2 decades to resettle in the peripheries. Specifically, the political machinations in post 1971 Bangladesh, saw large number of lower caste Hindus wanting to take refuge in their Bengal Homeland, who were then resettled in the Dandakaranya regions across Orissa, Chattisgarh and surrounding areas. The Left which was in the opposition, ran on the plank of ""Bengal for Bengalis"", promising to resettle the refugees in parts of Bengal, like the Islands of Sunderbans, only to renege on that promise after coming to power. All the refugees, who supported the left basically sold their wares to resettle in the islands of the Sunderbans, were suddenly infiltrators who were destroying the ecology, leading to a massacre at the Moricchanjhappi Islands.

[Here](http://sanhati.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/jalais-morichjhanpi.pdf) is an article, that beautifully covers this history, and also looks at the massacre from the perspective of tiger conservation.

***Dwelling on Morichjhanpi : When Tigers Became ‘Citizens’, Refugees ‘Tiger-Food'***

*In 1978, several hundred Bengali refugees in Morichjhanpi, one of the northern-most forested islands of the Sundarbans, were brutally evicted by the authorities for violating the Forest Acts. This paper looks at how the memory of Morichjhanpi was evoked by the islanders to reveal their resentment about the unequal distribution of resources between them and the Royal Bengal tigers of the Sundarbans reserve forest. The government’s primacy on ecology and its use of force in Morichjhanpi was seen by the Sundarbans islanders as a betrayal not only of refugees and of the poor and marginalised in general, but also of Bengali backward caste identity. At the same time, the reasons leading to the Morichjhanpi massacre have to be understood in relation to the long history which led to the partition of Bengal and the intricacies of caste, class and communal differences""*

&#x200B;

And so, by ignoring the inherent caste and class dynamics, including the upper-caste domination of the left parties, without understanding historical context - reframing this as a massacre of migrant Hindus is quite problematic. It is like calling the Afghani casualties under Taliban, as Massacre of Muslims.

&#x200B;

Edit: Grammar, and added the link It is extremely disturbing that in India the Left has been given the chance to dominate intellectual discourse and preach about violence, fascism, tyranny, bigotry etc.

Because if you look at the post-independence history of Kerala and West Bengal, no political force in India has ever been as violent, fascist, tyrannical and bigoted as the Left.

Educated 'intellectual' voices serving as a cover for thugs and goons. This is a problem with much of the opposition and why they and their fanboys look disingenuous when they cry about saving India's democratic values. [removed] > Around thirty police launches and two B.S.F. steamers


They had BSF assistance? This was a border issue then. It was definitely a tragic incident but this is being used a political tool by right wingers to further their ""Hindus are in danger"" narrative especially this being election season.

Just look at OP's post history and the comments in the article. I doubt the govt or the police massacred them because they were Hindus, its because they were refugees(which is still bad). There are definitely many instances of violence caused by the leftist govts but the way its worded, it reeks of bias.

[This](https://thewire.in/history/west-bengal-violence-marichjhapi-dandakaranya) article about the same incident is worded better. Anita Ghosh's 'The Hungry Tide' has this incident as one of the premises. It's shocking and unbelievable. This happened in 1979 (""31 January 1979""). We only know of this now. This is blood on Jyoti Basu's hands. This is disgusting and disturbing.  Every now and then, a new story comes up and reveals power abuse by political leaders you think were good people. This shows how important it is to have a media that reports everything. I doubt Basu or the Left would have enjoyed so many terms if news like this came out today (keep 2002 aside for a minute, these are Hindus). The article does not mention anything about court cases or human rights litigations (refugees are humans, though not citizens) after this event. 

There needs to be a serious modification to the Left ideology and an insistence on non-violence has to be introduced into the core ideology. Armed revolution does not work well in India and definitely not in this century, given that climate change is coming. It would lead to complete civil war. 

India's Left has to become pacifist from the ground up or end up becoming semi-fascist.

You may not agree with his political views, but he is fierce and straightforward. He has always been great on the mike, but his speeches during current election season are captivating, factual, and truly amazing.

He does not rely on Emotional Sentiments to win over the crowds and his new method of displaying video clips on large screens to back up his claims is great.",ati_hushaar," I would say Jayalalitha. Leaving aside the controversies on her, during her last few years of life her speeches had gained the hearts of many Tamilians. Without an iota of doubt ..
Raj Thackeray.
Doesn't talk rubbish.,even in interviews he is spontaneous and always talks to the point Vajpayee >and his new method of displaying video clips on large screens to back up his claims is great.

This is definitely something other national leaders should copy. 

Visual presentations can be quite successful. But you have to get the lighting and set up right so everyone can see. 

Non political presentators do adopt this in conferences already for this reason. karunanidhi I would say Narendra Modi is by far the best orator India has seen since Vajpayee ji left office and political life.

The opposition has failed miserably in being able to produce a counter to him. He certainly resonates with the people.

Raj Thackeray is good as well, but he is limited in his reach. Kanhaiya Kumar, Yogendra Yadav.. Kanhaiya Kumar. Even if I dont agree with his stance. Mamata Banerjee. People outside Bengal may laugh at her, but she cares zilch about them. She knows exactly what buttons to push in her speeches to get the public in Bengal eating out of her hands.",Political,2019-04-20 01:02:20

Modi targets the dead leaders!,296,bm5kes,https://i.redd.it/6hp040vjtzw21.jpg,81,,sudden_dust," colour of NoMo's chaddis is wrong. It should be khaki. What is dead may never die (again) . The black colour shown in photo is a reference to ink mentioned in the recently published Bal Narendra Comic where Kid Modi throws ink from behind on some mischievous boys who are bullying a kid so that he can complain about them with proof to the teachers. Modi is bad, really bad but that doesn't mean Rajiv Gandhi was good. Remember what he said during the Sikh riots ""when a giant tree falls the earth is bound to shake"". The moral dilemmas I am in is this just because someone is dead are we not allowed to criticize them. In the future when Modi is gone should we forget about Gujarat riots and his comments about feeling sad about running over a puppy? Bal Narendra never grew up.. Rajiv Gandhi won't be in heaven. He's a piece of shit like Modi. 

The problem is not attacking dead leaders. 

It's talking about ridiculous irrelevant bullshit in 2019 out of the blue in an election campaign. So if Modi dies after few years, should nobody criticize his actions because he would be dead?

Censoring criticism of dead people becomes a two way street People arguing one shouldn't criticize the dead,
Would you respect and not criticize Osama Bin Laden or Hitler?

I don't get it, this attitude of clearing a dead person of any mistakes he committed seems to happen a lot in India. What bullshit logic is this? So if a person is dead, one should not criticize them? Congress doesnt mind milking the udders of the dead for their political gains? What does the Gandhi generation have today to show for themselves if not their heritage? The people of Amethi and Raebareli have openly said they vote for Rahul and Sonia due their heritage. So now if someone questions this heritage he is wrong? Hardly ‘leaders’. More like manipulators. He still gonna win even with all this shit. People learn very slow Doesn't he understands that someday long after he also is dead some other asshole leader (not unlike him)  will spare no bone in slinging mud in his name too.  What goes around comes around I'm sorry but famous journalist Vinod Dua disagrees with you.

https://youtu.be/R_uTryBkUh4?t=10 I think the people who died should be given their respect. It doesn’t matter what they did. They’re dead. They can’t correct their mistakes.

‘Congress must die’: Yogendra Yadav’s pronouncement stirs debate,83,bqsetb,https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/congress-must-die-yogendra-yadav-s-pronouncement-stirs-debate-102076?amp&__twitter_impression=true,86,,hipporama," Even if Congress dies, if votes gets split across multiple alternatives, BJP will still win. In Bangalore south, there were 20+ alternatives to BJP when I went to vote. > Today, Congress represents the single biggest obstacle in the path of creating an alternative. 

The alternative is hundreds of 'secular' parties like his own Swaraj India which split each other's votes and help BJP. That or endless pre-poll alliance dramas. One big issue seems to be the first past the post system in elections. A party with 30% votes can win a lok sabha seat. 

Are there any statics on Lok Sabha seats vs Won-by-percentage? If we had a runoff system or a rank-your-choices system on the ballot (like in Iran elections) then the issue of vote splitting and gatbandhans wouldnt exist. Congress must live. But the dynasty rule must die. When nepotism takes precedence, quality and ethics decline. Get rid off non-performer raga and hold democratic voting on next leader. It astonishes me that a party that gave MMS, Tharoor, Pilot in recent times just can't have any of their great politicians rule it. The real problem is that country is an idiocracy. In the past we were lucky enough to elect relatively less harmful politicians. That luck has run out now.

Even if there was a politician that talked sense and wanted to do something useful for the country, who would vote for him? 70% of the country are far more interested in religion and caste than on economic issues. A huge majority is uneducated or educated but incapable of critical thinking and easy fodder for fake news that modern technology can generate effortlessly. The most populous states that are key in determining the next government are also the most illiterate. The odds are very low of such a population electing some politician that is interested in the real things. The only way to get people to vote for you is to talk about religion/caste or prey on their fears. Push pilot instead of raga. Pilot would even get votes from many right wingers when modi leaves politics I'd much rather have STV or some better voting system rather than FPTP to more accurately represent the voters. The difference in voting percentages isn't as drastic as the number of seats. Don't give a fuck about this fraud. Valar Morghulis! Why not RSS? What a crap this man is. One of the major reasons opposition is so fucking weak in India is because of Anna Hazare-Kejriwal gang's maligned so-called revolution against Congress in 2013-2014. They blamed Congress for EVERYTHING and virtually lynched congress in 2014 elections. Result? Congress faced one of the worst defeat in Indian history. They got so little seats they couldn't even provide a significant opposition in assembly. They laughed at congress's defeat saying 'they needed a tough lesson'. Today this same people are shitting their pants when Modi is on its way end democracy in India. 

Why should Rahul Gandhi be blamed for ANYTHING?  Is he the sole citizen of this nation? Is he the protector of 'the idea of India'. His only duty was to pose as an alternative and he did a good enough job. 

If Modi is so fucking bad, why don't you vote Modi out? If Indian people are so delusional, what can Rahul do? RaGa needs to step down. I saw him saying this live. His delivery was perfect.

Interesting dynamic. Rahul is leaning left and left and as of now, I dont see it as a bad thing. >“if you want RTI on political party so I also put in top 20 businessmen in the country” as “I want to understand what they are doing”

This shows that Rahul is just finding whatever excuses he can, for not bringing political parties under RTI.. These are good ideas of implemented properly. Given that congress/UPA managed to roll out RTI, and keep it functional despite immediate negative consequences to themselves (many cases of corruption being exposed), they deserve another chance at doing this.

While we're at it, we must demand that they reverse m modi's legalization of political party corruption: being them under fcra, make corporate donations public, and limit them.

Every one of these institutions needs increased transparency. E.g. judiciary in promotion, case application, and other administrative processes.  [deleted] Why the ""if"" No he won't and no he is not happy about it.",Political,2019-02-25 06:40:23
"Is it just me or do people, especially the youth, find it ""cool"" to be right wing these days?",154,bkgons,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bkgons/is_it_just_me_or_do_people_especially_the_youth/,149,"I have a lot of friends who I feel are right wing for the sake of it. They don't want to look at facts/data. They keep repeating nonsense talking points

They all come from some of the best schools/colleges and all of them keep complaining about Muslims, and Congress, and all of them see Modi as their Messiah.


Is this just me or is anyone else noticing this?

Maybe this ties into the trend of people uploading ""Libtard destroyed"" and ""Snowflake melted with facts and logic"" compilations on YT?",Ni7es," I actually believe there is something much deeper going on. My hypothesis is that as the world is becoming smaller, technology invades every aspect of our lives, jobs become harder to get, economic growth is becoming jobless etc.  there is a feeling of ""being adrift"", losing your identity and a more general malaise which is pervading the consciousness of our time. At times like these, people try to hold on to whatever they can to ""root"" themselves. Especially ideologies which promise people a return to the so called ""good old Glory days"" when all was well with the world appear very attractive and people get invested in them. I don't even think it's a conscious choice, it just calls out to them and they get swept up in it. Of course, those glory days never really existed the way people imagine but the fantasy is enough to give people something believe in. Hell yeah. These are the same people who blindly quote newspaper articles as ""facts"" and get pissed off when asked about govt data. Back in our days, youth used to smoke and drink to look cool Ehh in my circle i see more and more young people going full left wing. 

I am seeing more of my previously left wing uncles and aunts going right wing though. Some are even calling for a full alcohol ban and some such, they haven't gone of the deep end and blindly support modi and the like, still question everything but become more willing to criticize Muslims and Islam , general liberalism etc etc. Because people want simplistic solutions. The ordinary indian is a hypocrite. He, who doesn't want to pay taxes, will also be the first one to blame price rise. He, who says pvt sector all good, is often the one appearing for govt sector jobs and crying scam after failing. He, who doesn't pay wages to his maid on time, is bitchy against the company since it doesnt pay bonuses on time. He, who wants poor people to be ghettoized, is also the first to cry foul, if the sarkar does something to reduce his social protection.  And see, the average urban Indians is just a semi skilled labour. Some works in the IT industry. Some in PSUs, and some in govt. They aren't educated. Coz the education system in india always followed the victorian lines. Compartmentalized education only makes you as good as a ""half Moron"".  They want one thing. Socialism for me. Capitalism for everyone else. And it shows. 

They don't want solutions. They want such attempts at solutions that tell them, well, everything is good and fine, and you were never at fault. That's the biggest problem. No, you were never at fault. That's what they want to listen. That's why they want to find a common enemy. A common enemy keeps them UNITED. UNITED BY HATE. just think, these secluded, deluded beings in their homes, now all of a sudden, find social legitimacy of their deluded ideas from other deluded people. They need enemies. Muslim is an enemy. In other words its just a catchphrase, to classify you and maybe lynch you and take their frustration out. Frustration of what? Of them being LOSERS in their own lives. Leftist, another catchphrase.

See, a proper solution would need sacrifices from all sides. Questioning the poor is easy. He doesn't have the stick to beat your ass up and throw you in jail. Questioning the 0.01% is difficult. They might file defamation suits against you. People normally, prefer the path to least resistance. Further this is added up by the social syndrome of OBIDIENCE. 

Questioning is something that is banal in indian households. So, yes, they don't question the whatsapp forwards they get. 

You know what the 1% do? They justify and give legitimacy. See babri masjid. Show one rich baniya who was on spot. None. But rich gujaratis did help by money, did help by saying, hum kattar hindu hain, jo hua accha hua. Its like that.

So, at the end of the day, the ordinary indian doesn't see another indian as a brother or sister or compatriot. He sees the other as a competitor. Sharma ji ka beta zyada marks laya. So, u need to defeat him by hook or crook. If you dont, you don't know maths. The bonding between Indians thus needs a common passion. And such camaraderie can naturally happen, if the people just be compassionate towards others. Given the above thing hasn't, a common enemy has acted as the unifying agent. Pakistan, muslim, leftist, socialist, SJW, are all the symptoms of a failing society, that is clawing on the final straw of hate to unify itself.. and of Capitalism, that has only said ""invisible hand of self interest"" First let’s all raise our hands and say Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Yeah, I agree. 

Additionally, it is much easier to be on the extremity of the right or the left. It is much harder to be in the ideological center of politics. 

Being in the center requires brainwork, questioning everything the politicians say, cross checking ""facts"" against actual data and ground reality. 

To be on the extremities all one requires is emotions. Used to be the other way round not too long ago. When I joined reddit atheism posts would hog front page too. Being someone who's a former conservative, right wing and *bhakt*, I think it all boils down to upbringing.

I come from a slightly conservative Brahmin family, I was always raised to believe in my parent's opinions. Things like reservation isn't needed, Brahmins/Hindus are superior, love marriages are bad, rapes happen because of short skirts among other things.

It was only after I moved to another city for graduation, I faced reality and finally got an exposure to how wrong my parents were. Those four years completely changed my mindset. [How BJP-leaning youth differ from the rest](https://www.livemint.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/how-bjp-leaning-millennials-differ-from-the-rest-1556771219882.html)

*The YouGov-Mint Millennial Survey was conducted online, among 5,038 respondents from YouGov India’s panel of internet users spread across more than 180 cities—2,709 of the 5,038 respondents were millennials (including 1,489 younger millennials), 1,188 were from the Gen-Z (born after 1996). Among the rest 1,141, nearly three-fourths belonged to the Gen-X (born between 1965 and 1981), while the rest were even older. Overall, there is not much to tell the two groups apart when it comes to a host of social issues*.

*However, there are three key issues on which there is a stark divide between the BJP-supporting youth and the rest: Ram Mandir, the consumption of meat products (especially beef), and the consumption of alcohol. For a generation that reached adulthood after the demolition of the Babri Masjid, the support for a Ram Mandir at the disputed site appears most surprising* . Depends on the crowd. Honestly I  see most kids following whatever party their parents support I will give where the credit is due. Modi has been filling venom in their mind since last 5 years, non-stop, while others where trying hard to be an opposition. Modi has the young ones by the balls and they are convinced that there are no alternatives around. These guys are really great at brainwashing. They have they 18-25, 40plus crowd in their favor by constantly shitposting anti-nehru and anti-congress material. And, most of the posts are about how Modi is a victim in all of this as if Nehru personally molested his mother! Absolute Yes. It is also because misinformation being spread on social media and top media houses showing biased news. I saw people mindlessly Hating on Gandhi and Nehru based upon something they read on WhatsApp. But this too shall pass. Indian youth's political views are still in adolescence. We need unbiased news and fact based journalism to fix that. I don't know if this is controversial, but I'm gonna say it:

1. Its rebellion thing. This country, all every country, is headed towards a liberal future. the pace it is going at maybe slow, but it will reach there. So if the prevailing opinion is one of liberalism, it's cool to be on the opposite side. 

2. Some young people are just too inexperienced to understand the arbitrariness of patriotism. When the right-wing  
is getting all riled up 'my country, my culture'  the young people feel like they are tapping into a great spiritual well of wisdom and ape along.

Personal observation: This is also why some youths sing along with anthem in cinemas even when they know people are laughing at them. Right wing : aggresive, immediate and often extreme. Thats also the nature of a young adult. it was the plan and its the plan if you want to stay in Power fool the young voter. **India has** more than 50% of its **population** below the age of 25 and more than 65% below the age of 35.  

Modi/ BJP knows how to fool young people and in recent speech of modi you must have heard him saying ""I want to ask my first-time voters, can your first vote be dedicated to the soldiers who conducted the Balakot air strikes? Can your first vote  be in the name of the martyrs who lost their lives in Pulwama,""  [Modi got the young voters](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/lok-sabha-elections-2019-pm-narendra-modis-big-appeal-to-my-first-time-voters-in-rally-at-maharashtr-2020177)

There is a left-wing metal band in Germany called Rammstein. They released their new song called Deutschland. Now, just watch the video and try to infer what it means without lyrics. [https://youtu.be/NeQM1c-XCDc](https://youtu.be/NeQM1c-XCDc)  


Why am I sharing this in r/india? Because nationalism seems cool because of this kind of imagery without context.  


(I know rammstein is far left, and they make such videos for the sake of controversies, but you will get the point from indian context)

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------  
That aside, this is what I think:

&#x200B;

The youth is not actually attracted to Gaumutra and Sanskar stuff. It is attracted to respect, glamour, money and power (they don't care at whose expanse until they know it's ""one of their own"" \[1\] ); And right wing capitalism is the shortest and sure shot path to get there.   


To many of them (and us), left wing path means ""Waiting for the most unprivileged to get something before advancing further"". So if a youth dreams to be the next Elon Musk or Tony Stark, they don't want to wait for the poorest to come to parity with them. I know its wrong, but thats what most of them (and initially I and my circle) used to think. They don't want to wait. They want to get the world. Morals mean less to them.  


\[1\] There is also the tribal mentality of ""One of Us"" going on. But that's not the unique phenomenon to the youth. Every age group is infected with it. Thanks OP for  this question.  

The whole idea of boxing oneself in a set pattern of thought seems indicative of the lack of critical thinking among the Indian masses be it left leaning or right. And while this may be an unpopular opinion, no one in India or perhaps a select few are completely neutral of the bias(left or right). We don't have any more free spirits in the true sense of the word, we either have radical left sympathisers or their counterpart in the right. The media houses have been split into left and right as well, journalism isn't neutral anymore. No one is. If you're reading this there's a good chance that you yourself have some inherent biases that you are unaware of.  
But these are just my two cents. I may myself be biased and unaware of the same. I am constantly disappointed by who these people turn out to be. 

Yesterday I discovered that one of my best friends in office who I perceived to be a very balanced and composed guy turned out to be one of them.

He thinks that Sadhvi Pragya is being framed by media and Narendra Modi fought relentlessly to stop Gujarat 2002 riots. He also says that Babri Masjid demolition in Ayodhya was justified. 

I am concerned by how many people are turning into biased religious extremists under this government's watch. >Is it just me or do people, especially the youth, find it ""cool"" to be right wing these days? 

You can thank Ben Shapiro,Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson for that. Hero worship chutiyapa. DNA mein hai🤣 The upper middle class and above youth don't find it cool at all. Seen as low class. Everyone is liberal. Source: My whole social circle and myself 

It's more the frustrated youth with not enough opportunities that take up all this shit to find some purpose. Just you. People can have political opinions just because they are PEOPLE. [removed] It's the exact opposite imo. People pretend to be liberals just to look like intellwctuals. They will readily put the LGBT color as background in their profile picture without even knowing what that actually means. Worldwide rise of the right wing against their own neoliberal reforms making social safety nets necessary. Actual left wing parties like CPI(M) are incredibly successful tho throws a wrench in their anti-center left and center-right positions. Growing up in India where you get recognition being part of the religious sect or maybe just going to temples and mosques, people tend to identify themselves with the same agenda as the one right-wing peddles. They tend to believe some propaganda as the truth because they are led to believe the things since a long time. This happens in households, schools, with peers, overhearing your parents, etc. Indian society doesn't place much value on individual identity and when people get value at these right wing institutes they are overwhelmed by it and start to understand that institute as their family of sorts. Many youth also become right-wing supporters because it is a sort of fashion to do so among their circles while many don't realise because of lack of education that there is something like a 'right-wing' for that matter XD.  So yeah, it is cool in many places to be a right winger. But so is true in a different manner for the other side of the spectrum as well. I think a lot of it comes from everyday media we consume.

Economic right-wing philosophy is the overarching theme in almost all films and tv shows. The individualism it eulogizes is present even in cartoons. 


Think about it. The whole idea of a person changing their situation themselves, a person beating all odds to overcome hardships, become successful and win the american/indian dream. Everything from Matrix to the Avataar cartoons embody this idea. 

Children are raised not understand how much their caste and class has set their lives up and instead think they are special because they have earned their success. 

The very idea of a socialist approach to things is repulsive to them because they feel that people (that did not win the birth lottery) are lazy/undeserving and do not put in the effort to improve their financial/social condition. 

The intelligensia are usually leftwing. And the governments in India need to lean left because of our huge economically backward population. This additionally rankles them and the conservative ideals - which maintain their hegemony are what they default to. 

Its the norm the world over. I consider myself as leaning to the right, and I think the traditional right wing is a minority. It's mostly the BJP 'ModiKaChooso' personality cult that's been gaining traction. 

My explanation to why the young turn to this, is because of the identitarian nature of the internet age. Young Indians encounter mockery online for their race and blame through media within the country, and are constantly reminded of their lack of privilege. In a Hindu identitarian party like the BJP, you see the hope of gaining that privilege at least within the borders of the country and the bounds of the subcontinent. There's little more to it, than a heightened sense of inferiority. 

There are of course many good right wing thinkers (Rajiv Malhotra being none of them), who do see beyond this whole obsessive identitarianism. Here's a good example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnyAh7bLdIA I would say it has reduced. People have slowly realized that Modi is not all that good. And the inductions of Yogi and Pragya and the like have definitely put off some people. Most of them are taught to be extreme selfishness from childhood to be successful. The society and the parents tried their best to kill all empathy within them. So, they love extreme right wing agendas of torturing and killing innocents who are different from them. [deleted] Generally speaking the youth is stupid!

One simply likes to be a part of Sides which tend to win a lot!

Right wing has been on a rise for the past few years. Majority of the global economies including India are run by right wing political parties.

It makes sense to support those sides which will win, this is the same reason why in IPL CSK has most fans, they just win a lot so I would obviously look cool supporting the team which wins a lot. It is just you To me it's kinda opposite. It has become cool to be left wing and oppose current government for every other reason. Left wingers acts like they're 'woke' or something. Another factor that drives their support is the stupid SJW mentality. I don't know much about politics but if I'm sure about one thing, it is that politics always changes. Yesterday, it was left wing and tomorrow it will be right wing, right now we are in the middle of a flux.

Right now, the central govt. is ruled by a right wing party (which gives the false impression that they are ruling everywhere) but the establishment which consists of media, intelligentsia, bureaucracy, IAS/IPS, EC, SC, etc. is still dominated by left wing in India. It will still take many years for right wing to reach these areas.",Political,2019-05-04 10:45:23

Some of his past comments from Wikipedia

-- While addressing a rally in Sambhal, Azam Khan appealed to people to take revenge against the “murderers of Muzaffarnagar.”.  
-- Azam Khan insulted his political opponent Narendra Modi, saying: ""We don’t want your sympathy, elder brother of a dog’s son."".  
-- On 11 April 2014, Azam said that Sanjay Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi had been punished by Allah for their sins: the former for forcible sterilisation of men during the Emergency, and the latter for - what he said was an equal sin - the shilanyas (foundation stone-laying) of the Ramjanmabhoomi temple at Ayodhya.  
-- It has been alleged that he pressured the police to not arrest people from the Muslim community during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots.   
-- Shortly after the Muzaffarnagar riots, he was in the news when he tasked dozens of uniformed policemen, and their sniffer dogs, to locate and bring back some buffaloes that had gone missing from his dairy farm.

Sent a mail to Jio about not being able to access Reddit and they replied that its due orders from the government,956,b4ikov,https://i.imgur.com/gINV02T.jpg,255,,dominoanty," I use Airtel and Reddit works as it always used to.  Government orders should be public information. Ask them to share it. I'm using jio and Reddit works perfectly fine. You can use that to put a consumer court case. Where in they will have to produce the order by the government blocking Reddit.com

The only way to fight reliance is by due process.  Ask them for the official circular. If it has been indeed blocked there probably has been a notice/circular abt it. Govt. has not blocked Reddit.  I can access Reddit from Jio network. Circle:Jio Karnataka.  This looks edited to me. The sender is not Jio Care. That red lock near the sender's name means it was not encrypted.  u/internetfreedomIN My isp unblocked all sites including nsfw ones. Tell them to share the link to that government order. I'm on Jio right now. Must be from State government. Where do you live? Can someone file an rti with trai regarding the lost and reason for blocking sites? Bro I am using jio and Reddit is working for me ,also I am from delhi. Anyone can create a Gmail ID, give it the name JIO care and send this mail to one self. Share the details of the sender the mail once.  We have a government? Ask them for a copy of the order with list of blocked sites. I have observed that Jio blocks a lot more websites than it is supposed to. Or is it due to DNS errors? Can somebody shed some light on it? I'm a noob :3 Btw Reddit seems to work fine on Airtel. It works on Vodafone and my local ISP hasn't blocked it either tho (Mumbai) Well could you provide more proof of this actually being a legit mail sent by Jio, It doesn't take much to fabricate an email using photoshop  ,Since there are is no actual record of government banning Reddit Jio wouldn't make the mistake of claiming this and landing into legal trouble,All the bans carried out by the government are public info and the circulars can be found in public domain  I am currently using reddit on jio Working for me in Rajasthan and Delhi NCR So Jio customer care replied to you at 1:33 AM? Time to file RTI .Govt is should be held accountable . I can use it on Jio though... Browsing Reddit on Jio just fine.  It's working for me in app as well as in browser . Dunno what you're smoking. I opened Reddit.com on my Jio phone, and it loaded just fine. Here I am, using reddit on broadband. High time we fuck Jio. Too much power in one hand.  Tweet about this. Share on your social media. Tag jio, reliance and internet freedom foundation. Let people know they are being controlled and confined. Why government did't block whatsapp when lynching was going on. This asshole don't have balls. Using Jio in Calcutta now. Reddit works just fine. Jio is Jhumla company. Looks like RailWire (ISP in our PG in Bengaluru) is blocking reddit. I changed my DNS server to Cloudflare's [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) and reddit started working :) It looks to me that government has got its hands in everything now, they're invading our personal space and are making us feel uncomfortable, it's so distressing. Whom we should raise our voices against such kind of unfair treatment when government is being partial here? This looks like a template email with <sitename> replaced with reddit.com. Most likely the person (or script) writing the mail has no idea about reddit.com. Authoritarianism at its finest. Block all outlets where questions about your governance are being asked. This is a murder of democracy  Here i am using Reddit from my mobile device with jio as the isp  They want our tax money and will censor our internet (paid by us) too - wonderful. Reddit works just fine in Bengaluru both on Jio and Airtel I live in Tamil Nadu and reddit.com hasn't been working for past 2 weeks. I also use Jio If true, this is the most regressive thing a state can do. What are we now, North Korea?  Change your DNS to Cloudfare's free DNS 1.1.1.1. It has solved the problem of Reddit not loading on Jio for me. FYI there's also an app for it in case you're accessing Reddit from mobile.  It works on Idea, for now. However, this makes it even more worrying, because now it is not about why, now it is about for how long. It is working fine in airtel. But could not find anything related to banning of reddit in news anywhere. operator: the govt said so

govt: no such instructions from our side

redditors: dafuq is going on?

RTI activists swoop in to save the day and enlighten us all   I am on jio and Reddit works fine for me. When did it happen? ""Hello?""

""Yes Sir this is Airtel , we would just like to say we offer no restrictions on browsing including \*cough\* \*cough\* sites, so....... Well I can access 1337x torrent site and many porn sites on my Vodafone connection so don't know what they're on about. Surprisingly it is also blocked in Railway Station’s Wifi provided by Google  Reddit has never been blocked for me? Working fine on both Jio and my Fibre BB. This mail doesn't make sense.  Try HTTPS? Use [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) and [1.0.0.1](https://1.0.0.1) as DNS. What a previliged outrage to have, right? In a country where rape scenes show up in movies but female nipples or any nudity is not. We should keep RSS away from censoring the internet.  I m using Jio to use reddit app and it's working fine .  Reddit works fine and I'm using Jio! I use jio. Reddit works well here. I am from Tamil nadu. I am on jio and commenting in ur post. Works fine for me. Restart ur phone which is the best way according to some it guy to solve all your issue including ptsd. Have a good day saar. Now you write to government, to clarify about the order.  Fake Cause they can't spread news that modi is most hardworking pm on r/india... Reddit works on Airtel, Delhi This is exactly why we cant let Jio become a monopoly. They don't get to dictate what we say and do.  I do hate their blocking of porn, but reddit seems to be working just fine here.  There there I'm using Jio in Delhi NCR circle and reddit is working here and if such thing happens, I'm switching my network. 
Maybe if people switch their networks from one to other, maybe the companies will be forced to open jio again Just checked now. Jio has indeed blocked Reddit. This is in Kerala. Using Jio to peruse reddit app and post this comment My friend in Goa can't access either, jio Idk why they would block Reddit. Could be the DNS blocking the website. Try using Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 app from the play store.  WTF
..glad I'm on Vodafone and airtel Use VPN or proxy links dum dum I have jio and it works  But I get Reddit in my phone and I use jio I'm on Jio and it is working as usual. Download app.It works fine I'm using Jio and running Reddit App.  I'm using Reddit on my Jio Reddit is currently working fine for me,both app and desktop website. Today i tried to open ""reddit"" using railwire wifi but they also blocked this site in secundrabad File an RTI with the appropriate department. Then file PIL against reliance. Withdraw case taking bribe from reliance.  
Profit I use Jio and reddit is working fine. I live in Delhi, where do you live, OP? The company owned by the man who controls the government is using the government that he controls as an excuse for banning a website that acts against the interests of the government he controls.

Infinite loop detected. Cannot compute  Fake Ya!  What are the intention behind blocking?
Can't be take help from Reddit team to look into it?  It's time for a fucking crusade. Where is Ravi Shankar prasad and his die hard support to net neutrality Wow, the government can do that? 

They do care about the 200 Indian people who visit reddit and how their opinions influence elections. meh Reddit works perfectly for me. I use Jio too! I don't how does this work area wise or something else but I'm using Jio and Reddit app and website is working pretty fine for me Yeah this email is really fishy no details only shows the Jio care name, anyone can create an email called Jio care and send this mail to themselves I use jio and I am able to access it fine for some reason. 
 Works fine for me in Maharashtra The ""Hope this helps"" is like a slap on the face! video is the main source how indian consume 1.5gb per day data generally. So they never gonna block youtube or other video sites until mota bhai make a motatube for indians This is India’s article 13, but just for banning various websites  i use reddit app quite comfortably on jio network and can open site on laptop too, connected by jio hotspot. Hi, where exactly is this happin? Asking because I am able to access reddit over my jio connection. Which circle are you in?  I did the same thing with Airtel for blocking Streamable and they said it's a issue they are facing and they will let me know when they can resolve it.

The twats. Pls submit your comments to mota bhai. He will post on reddit on your behalf. It's working fine for me on JIO I think the censorship and blocking is coming from the state governments, that is why some people in different states are able to access reddit and some cannot.  Could it be the effect of chinese pumping the money in Reddit ?  Pakistani here, Why indian government ban reddit? What's the story? Pure fascism. Reddit works fine in my Jio. (Kerala).

Probably recommended by her therapist. No wonder people chose Modi over mamta banarjee.Because of things like jailing people just for chanting jai shree ram, She comes off as anti-hindu and dictatorial.

She was being considered as the PM for the mahagathbandan, No way people were gonna like her with such antics.There are tons of clips and news of her getting triggered and losing her cool if some one was critical of her.Her only card is get angry, cry victim, call people commie or BJP outsiders and jail the people who criticised her or satirized her.

In case of Modi,He knows value of PR and clean image. You cannot stick any shit on him.Someone make fun of Modi, gets jailed,It's because one of his bhakts filed the FIR, not because he told police to arrest someone. She could just say Jai maa Durga and end it with a mic drop. Props to bjp, when you can  trigger someone with 3 words. I wish I had that power. Coming up next on Google Maps... So basically  map of areas where she would lose , talk about political targeting Red areas, places to avoid. White areas are safe. Blue is water... The agencies should probably ask her to wear VR goggles and take a ride where ever she is going. Hahahahaha what This whole ""jai shri ram"" saga has the potential to create a friction between bengali and non-bengali population. BJP is doing what it does best. Exploiting existing fault lines and amplifying them further for electoral benefits. She is just playing in BJPs hand. How fucking dumb is she. BJP wanted ""Jai Shree Ram"" to be a political slogan and by reacting to the slogan everytime mamta is really doing BJP a favor. But why Jai Shri Ram and not Joy Durga Maa, after all most people worship durga there? kya chal rha hai, bolne do jisko jo bolna hai ya nahi bolna hai. pahle bjp ki bharat mata ki jai and now this. She is unwittingly handing over the advantage to BJP. BJP should use this as a rallying cry to consolidate the opinion against TMC.

1. A man has been made half bald, his moustache was half shaven off, coz he refused to chant some BJP slogan . This man is a fruit seller

2. Burst crackers near household windows. A splinter hit the maid. So the house owner came to protest. The rally broke all window panes by throwing stones

3. My kaamwali has been paid 7500 rupees for 3 votes, 2500 each, she, her husband and her daughter. I don't know how much goddamn money these fucks spend on an election

4. Motorcycles and cars have been randomly vandalised, in a lot of places using stones to scratch out BJP slogans on cars. 

All this happened in my town. 

Reportedly in hoogly a teenager has been killed by sanghis since he openly protested against them, and only local channels reported it for few minutes yesterday.

Another sportsman-turned-*chowkidaar.* I am not against sportsperson getting into politics but this is becoming like a BJP trend now. Have we run out of good intellectual political candidates?

updated: grammar spineless EC should disqualify Rathore since they cannot do that to Amit Shah, Yogi or Modi so that none can invoke Army for political reasons. 

Wish we had person like Seshan in EC now. BJP candidates are bringing army into politics as if we don't have any other issues in this country. So army has political affiliation now. Actually the Army is with the government *despite* BJP and PM Modi. I just hope that majority of voters use their brains before giving vote to the current ruling party. The way they are using every insitution of our country for their own personal campaigns, is really sickening. Honorable sir, Army belongs to nation as a whole and always ready to protect the nation from any danger. So, it is standing with nation that includes all political parties not only bjp. Why wasn't ex-Jawan given election ticket then? EC ban incoming? Imran Khan also stands by Modi

Hum bole to bole kya Is ECI in the mood to employe Model Code of Conduct on Rathore? Or will it be Modi Code of Conduct? 

I'm disappointed in this guy.I thought maybe he had some sense, but her turned out to be just like the rest fof RSS-BJP. Earlier: We stand with the army, we will support them
Now: Army is with us, they support Modi

Love how times have changed... He assumes he represents the army. On another news Maduro claims entire military stands with him. I guess Modi takes similar stance as Maduro. EC came up with the idea of Anticipatory Clean Chits, and gave it to all of BJP.

It may or may not be right. He could be a total coward and a traitor if we go by some of the things we know about him.

We do know that Savarkar wrote a book glorifying himself. https://thewire.in/history/veer-savarkar-the-staunchest-advocate-of-loyalty-to-the-english-government Read the part **Self-glorification of a defeated man**

Like in many of those movies and books where the villain turns out to be secretly the hero, Savarkar might be a hero. However, the proof that the author has put out and what his supporters have talked about is not convincing for me. It might be convincing for his supporters. by Vikram Sampath, lol!

The fact is that he kept his promise of being a British stooge after his release. So all the rigamarole this guy goes through to make savarkar veer comes to naught. \> Ironically, those who castigate Savarkar for the petitions advocate  human rights and mercy petitions of Ajmal Kasab, Yakub Memon, Afzal  Guru, and the Maoists and their intellectual fountainheads 

&#x200B;

No, you moron, people castigate Savarkar for sticking to the letter and the spirit of his mercy petitions after his release. I for one don't blame him for writing those letters. I don't blame him for retiring from the freedom struggle either. What I do blame him for is the active collaboration with the british; helping them divide and rule by spreading communal hatred and violence; for coming up with the two nation theory, where he envisioned muslims to be second class citizens; for actively opposing the quit india movement; for  forming coalition governments with the muslim league in 1939, when congress quit in protest; for advocating murder as a legitimate political tool in a democracy. If Savarkar was Veer then I am batman Why can't we Indians ever take historical figures to be grey characters? It's always 'woh madarchodh tha' or 'woh bhagwaan tha'.

 Game of thrones mein you want grey characters but not in real life? 

Be it Gandhi or savarkar.

How do everyone here cope with friends with different political ideology?,35,aw2qdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aw2qdy/how_do_everyone_here_cope_with_friends_with/,53,"Since past 2-3 months, there political interaction among friends has increased a lot, may be at cafe's or random meetings. I have lost quite a lot of good friends, which I think is purely due to political differences. Debates turn into heated arguments. Sometimes I am at fault, but many a time I do not understand how do you ignore the personal attacks?

&#x200B;

I am sure everyone of you has felt that, irrespective of your ideology. I have came to a realization that it is important to separate politics of a person from a person. I do that, but then how do you respond when you are personally attacked. Most of the debates generally turn into this rather than intellectual discussion.    


We all have biases, which is normal. But is it so hard to just go beyond that?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;",taplik_to_rehvani," Don’t respond. As soon as the debate gets personal the instigator has already lost, because you’re no longer targeting the ideology, but the person delivering the idea.

I would stop it there with a, let’s agree to disagree and leave it at that. Don’t push the topic any further and just talk about something else.  I *never* talk politics with my friends. If there's a political discussion going on, instead of giving an opinion I crack some jokes on the topic, which lightens up the mood for everyone. I suspect some of my friends think I'm ignorant about the world just because I crack a lot of jokes, but I'm okay with that. Actually because of that people are more open with me.

The best way to preserve relations is to simply not talk politics and religion. Try it. You'll be much happier. I just never talk about politics, like most other people here, with my friends. A friend of mine is a modi supporter, and I just choose not to respond or do a little ‘hmm’ any time he mentions him. He may be chutiya but he is a pal, and I don’t want this stuff to get in the way of our friendship. And I think he understands that now too.  One way to heal the political divide in our nation is through freindship, we need to emphasize people over ideology. Just tell the friends, you disagree with their political ideology and for the sake our friendship let's not discuss politics, if they don't want to be friends with you after hearing this, it's their loss. Just a general observation (relevant)

People with left leaning are willing to accept mistake and get corrected. They appreciate when right wing does something good.

However people with right wing leaning will never accept any mistake. They are the most stubborn types.  I have decided not to get into political discussion with them. You cannot fight emotions with reasons. Educate them about what is called critical thinking and logical fallacy You have friends? 😮 Yea my best friend is a Modi bhakt. Blocks me on WhatsApp every time some polarizing news takes place (Ind/Pak, Hindu/Muslim) and I show the hypocrisy. Then will unblock me after 2-3 days when bored and wants to talk again.


Rinse. Repeat.  Many other have said it I'd repeat it : NEVER discuss politics with people you want to have a healthy, close, and fun relationship with.

It's not a big deal, is it? Just steer away from the topic as soon as you see it on the horizon.  Simple: I've had a falling out with such friends Amongst friends it is an unwritten rule that politics and GPA are divisive and lead to strife and discord so we the to avoid discussing those topics. I hope I am not too late, but Id like to chime in. I have a friend who shares wildly different political opinions than me and it can be very tough to listen to him sometimes but I keep my calm and try to understand his opinion and why he has that opinion.
We usually don't have heated arguments but our case is an exception.

I get it that sometimes arguments can move away from hard facts and become fueled by raw emotions and when so happens people start throwing personal insults. As much as I hate to admit  it this case is especially true for  a lot of Indians, dunno why, maybe it's a cultural thing. 

But this friend of mine(mentioned above) was a pick in the litter, it just so happened that he and I both liked to have calm and fact associated discussions. I don't discuss politics with all my friends because I know it can get heated up and unnecessarily so.

*My point being only discuss political matters with those who think can engage in civil discussion and have normal conversations with your other friends.*

And if you get forced into discussing politics with someone who you know won't be calm or rational try to set ground rules, like tell them it's just discussion so let's try not bring any personal emotion into it (joke about how you can get heated up sometimes even though you actually don't, make sure they don't feel attack ed). Or like others have mentioned don't discuss it at all, just listen to them.

Sorry for the long read.  My neighbour came and started talking about how we did a magnificent job of destroying Pakistan's terror camps. I just said Modi is the best PM ever. That we should send all Muslims to Pakistan and then nuke Pakistan over and over. He was happy, jumped with joy and went back with a smile. Sometimes you have to consider therapy rather than truth.

EDIT: This is a good strategy where idiots are present. It does not work if a half-intelligent guy is present. He might call you out and then it backfires. I'm friends with a guy who thinks Seeman should be the PM of our country. I don't want to lose a friend. I have one friend who is madly in love with BJP, three who are support BJP but they do not defend BJP with their life and two who support Congress with everything they have got. I just go with the flow. Man why is it so tough to keep politics as a separate part of your life?  Political views are just that political.  Don't lose friends just because they support Modi or Rahul. Learn how to be accommodating. ",Political,2019-03-01 17:02:21

An anti-satellite weapon A-SAT, successfully targeted a live satellite on a low earth orbit.

-'Mission Shakti' operation was a difficult target to achieve which was completed successfully within three minutes of launch.

-India has registered herself as a space power today; till now only US, Russia and China have achieved this; now India is the 4th country to achieve this feat: PM 

-Today, we have enough satellites that are contributing in various segments such as agriculture, disaster management, communication, weather, navigation etc: PM 

-I assure the world community that our new prowess is not against anyone I'm confused, whose satellite was shot down? A non functional satellite or what? He is announcing to the world that we have the capability. A geopolitical announcement. Remember when China did the same and how the western powers reacted? This is actually a significant event. Needed the PM to announce it.  Better then our Australian space program. Which is nonexistent. Haven't even sent a jar of Vegemite up there yet 😂  Orgasmic material for BHAKTS!!

And for ME TOO! This is really huge!! Technologically this puts us into the super elite ranking especially with missile design. But that wasn't something we were really bad at. Kudos to the DRDO really. Now let us watch the BJP make it into something that they did when the reality is that ASAT development has been going on for a long time. Does this mean - we can shoot down Pakistani satellite when a terror attack happens as a deterrent ? ITT: Instead of being proud, I will portray my hatred for Modi. When i saw the announcement, i did not get the value the message had initially. But now i kind of get it. Kudos to the team.

But i have a small question. Not against anyone. So don't make judgements (Especially on political grounds) and try to give an answer. (If you know)

Why didn't the head of DRDO/ISRO make this announcement public ? Wont the nation/youth/kids get to the person/team who was actually behind this important feat ? [deleted] Now please to shoot down the satellites beaming our partisan news media. Khtanxbai!!! Sure the timing could be political but one cannot deny the fact that the test was performed during the present government. India's military might is definitely increasing and everyone should be proud of it. Kudos to our scientists ! This article from 2012 is doing the rounds on Twitter. https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/nation/story/20120507-agni-v-launch-india-takes-on-china-drdo-vijay-saraswat-758208-2012-04-28 Read this article in Reuter’s. What’s the need to say hindu nationalist party in this article ??  



https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-satellite-idUSKCN1R80IA The technology is really cool to have. But I doubt it can ever be used in a military context. Satellites(both launch and usage) are now commoditised to the extent that it can hardly be termed as a deterrent. Congratulations to DRDO and The Govt. Jai Hind! Next time someone asks ""what did Congress do in 70 years"" point them to DRDO When Modi did a press conference kinda thing for the announcement, I honestly thought there's another Demonetisation.  What about space debris?  bad fucking link Not sure how credible this video is (**if it's not, do let me know**) but you can take a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/XjOuXIC31sU) to get an overview. This news is getting too much hype. This is an okay achievement, we have one of the world's finest space program. Definitely the world's most effective one. Hitting a target in space is not a big deal when we have hit targets on the moon and sent missions to Mars. I would have been surprised if we couldn't launch a rocket accurate enough to hit a target in space considering we launched the most number of satellites in one rocket which requires a lot more precision.

Also if people start destroying even test satellites it will lead to Kessler syndrome eventually. Which is really really bad for all of humanity. Look it up. Is anyone doing anything about the space debris? https://twitter.com/ShivAroor/status/1110866464280465409 https://thewire.in/space/mission-shakti-india-likely-destroyed-microsat-r-satellite-in-first-asat-test

Here's a link that isn't shit. [removed] We had this technology since long back.  Thanks to DRDO for this 2010 started project ! Media is simply getting excited on this. We are not strong enough to attack the satellite of any country which can launch its own satellite(China, USA, Russia etc). We are then left with Pak. I am not sure Pak guys even have satellites(for any Defence related tasks), let alone India shooting them down.
Basically, this is good to have capability but wont deter Pak from doing another Pulwana or sending millitants to Kashmir. 
This is a jewel in the ornament we will not wear anytime soon. Cleaning up space junk would've been a better move to show power if you ask me Is this the third surgical strike that Sri. Rajnath Singhji was telling us about? Or is this the fourth? Good, now we need to build spacecraft that can take us to Mars. Because when the water in all major cities runs out in 2 years, and no other country will take us in, the only option is to go to Mars! India have had the capability to shoot down a satellite since last 10 years at least, so this move right now is more about making a political statement. Thinking about it, a lot of people won't even realize the significance of such power display. What's satellites smashing to a poor farmer?  >India is a space superpower now: PM Modi

Thank you, Mudi kaka. Without you we'd still be riding bullock carts, and hunting-gathering for food. [deleted] [deleted] and bjp takes credit I see nothing but more space junk contributed by us Soo.. what stops India from taking down Pak's satellite as a retaliation for sponsorin terrorism? 
 I'm wondering how this scenario would play out if Pak had any satellites at all .. Space is the one place that absolutely should not be weaponised. I unequivocally condemn every single nation, including my own country, which has developed technology and capabilities of this nature.

Space belongs to mankind at large, and not one or a few nations, and nothing should be done to impede a united mankind in space. Weaponising it does exactly that.

Besides, using weapons to destroy things in space results in the creation of additional space debris, which with time will only grow into a bigger problem and perhaps make it difficult to even enter or leave the planet. It's good to have the capability.  
But totally unnecessary to shoot down one in orbit.

Modi's Reign Is Proof India Will Be Better off Under a Coalition. Governments that are built around one leader and a single dominant political party often begin to show signs of arrogance and hubris.,222,agw5sk,https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-bjp-coalition,81,,ajfben," BJP supporters claim that coalition govt cannot take decisions quickly. But not taking a decision quickly is better than taking terrible decisions like DeMo, GST just because of the whims of a clueless uneducated attention-monger. Dont build government around people who aren't properly educated about the nuances of such a large country as ours. That's the bottom line. A proper education and empathy is needed.

The way these buggers have been steamrolling all other political and cultural identities using basic thuggery, contract killings, and rampant mob violence is not okay. Weak coalitions at Centre. Strong state governments. Our best bet.  Sure, just look at Karnataka right now. Yeah I don’t agree with him either but this is a pretty bold assumption to make. Coalition isn’t a check against decisions. It’s a roadblock. Because trust nobody’s there to ensure the beat laws go through they’re just there to get a piece of the cake. I mean did people forget about the pre-Vajpayee I days? We had like 3 PMs in a short span none of them could get anything done. Government’s built around a leader can do wonders depending on the leader. Which we know isn’t happening in this case. coalition is in no way better than complete majority I've been trying to explain this to people around me since 2014 What crap? Just because they 'often do' doesn't mean that they always will. This is such a harebrained article by The Wire. And they have conveniently explained away the Nehru era without even mentioning him. 1999-2014: PVNR, NDA1, UPA1, UPA2  Government s- all are coalitions and this the period most of the development we see around us has taken place.

India is heterogeneous and has widely varying interests. An overall beneficial policy would come about through a game-theoretic competition of opposing interests and coalitions are best at achieving this, by design. However, a one leader setting will lead to lot of one sided decisions in questions such as corporate vs adivasi interests, corporate vs common man's interests, state vs center's issues, rural vs urban issues etc.  [removed] Of course Mr. TheWire editor, sir. Because India was in a Golden Age from 2004-2014 under the coalition government. I think that government only looted around 10 lac crore from exchequer through their various scams. Huh, what is 10 lac crore, hardly worth mentioning, isn't it? And rapes, casteism, corruption etc. was unheard of during that time, right?

The problem, you paid news piece of bullshitting crap, is not single party or coalition party. The problem is cultural, whereby the general attitude of Indians is ""how can I scam the person next to me"" - right down from the local kaka who runs the genes shop all the way to the highest political office. Unless this culture changes, no single/coalition/divine government can change anything.

But you get paid to write stupidly biased articles without any evidence, so yes, please keep doing your job. That's just rubbish. It's logical fallacy. Because Modi has been bad , it doesn't mean India will be better under a coalition government. I'm not a big fan of the current government, but I'll take it over a coalition any day. It will be collusion not coalition  Lot of absurd comments here. Read about capabilities of Rafale first on Prime Videos and why 36 and not 100+ such aircrafts are needed. The issue is few libertards here who know zilch about Airforce & Aircrafts make imbecile comments. They fume since they got burnt due to reduced corruption, DeMo which ripped black money they stored at home instead of bank, GST - since it brought more efficiency.  I am an honest tax payer and I am happy what this govt. did. 

We are appalled that deceitful parties like Congress, BSP, SP, TMC, TRS, TDP who have a history of deep routed criminal & corruption record and often run by principle of nepotism framework is what forms a coalition is what you all want? Seriously?

If this somehow reaches our famous OTT's like Hotstar or MX Player or even Netflix I hope they create an Indian satire show that would keep us updated of the issues and events around us.

P.S. - Comedy Nights with Kapil and many more are satirical shows but the post is not about that.

**Tl;Dr We need to get our OTT players to create shows for their Indian audience that would be satirical at the same time keep us updated with the headlines of the news.**

**Edit:- Guys this post is totally non-political so please avoid getting political and talking about which party is better than the other in the comments please!**",anjan18," Comedy shows about Indian politics are not easy because most people won’t accept critique of the party they support. There is a reason why the shows you’ve mentioned are on online platforms because the intended audience is young, educated people. TV pe sirf Kapil Sharma ke ghatiya jokes chalte hai. But yes, it’s a genre that is missing in India... If you want a political comedy then you can watch Consti-tution by NewsLaundry on YouTube. 

There's also Soch on YouTube. It's not a comedy but they've recently analysed electoral prospects of parties  in different states. Plenty of videos on social issues too.

Both of these are hosted by one guy talking at the camera.

Spooksandooks on Facebook is also brilliant. Animated videos about various Indian issues - like our geopolitical strategies, our economy etc

If you want shows where political personalities are interviewed then Akash Banerjee and Kunal Kamra are both good. We want Movers and Shakers back on tv. There was a political comedy show by a radio dj babua on zee tv. Don't know if it's still on. Watch it to fill your political satire needs. Or actually don't because it was fucking terrible. To be fair, we need more Tonight show hosts like Jimmy Fallon, or Jimmy Kimmel. They aren't just about interviewing Celebs, but also about providing info to the public about various things, and, of course, Political Satire.

I'd prefer someone like John Oliver, whose jokes are on the thin line that separates ""going too far"" and ""being too safe"", where if you're the person being joked about, you just have to sit down, clap your hands, and say, ""Bravo"".

I have no idea which Indian Personality has the merit/charisma to take on the Indian World on Live TV, though. Any person you know who could do wonders on such a stage? Give Kunal Kamra and Ramit Verma a show.! ""Nation knows what's up"" Check out 'Bharat Ek Mauj' hosted by Sanjay Rajoura on youtube.  
Also, check out 'Aisi taisi democracy', which is a live comedy satire show done by Rahul Ram, Varun grover and Sanjay Rajoura  
If you want little more comedy and memes, checkout 'Yeh sab kya ho raha hai!"" on SnG Comdedy's youtube channel. Not happening in this country... People are very volatile here, I don't think anyone will openly criticize a politician, it's risky for themselves.

Edit: Hasan criticizes trump and Hilary openly, just imagine him in India... Don't think he will call out names, and if he did he will shipped to Pakistan since he is Muslim... India is like a quasi-theocracy today. Modi is a god to tens of millions of retards. Creating a good quality satirical show like Patriot Act or Last Week Tonight or Full Frontal With Samantha Bee isn't the challenge. There's an ocean of creative talent in India. The challenge is the kind of response such a show would elicit from a very easily offended audience. 

Donald Trump is the world's most powerful man, but not a day goes by without a comedian or even members of the general public casually using the worst possible abuses for him on national television and other media platforms.

That, as screwed up as it may be at the moment, is a true democratic country. 

Try doing that in India and the countdown to your inevitable lynching (at worst) or your public demonization with potentially scary fallout on your personal/professional life (at best) begins immediately. I read research on that most comedy satire based shows are left wing and the reasoning for that is, well, something along the lines of left wing people are more open to criticism in general etc. That is probably why we see so many satirical shows based in USA, like last week tonight, patriot act, stephen colbert and so many more and all of them are left wing.

Maybe the reason why India doesnt have a show like that is because India is more right wing? On a side note: I feel like Indian reality shows need a major revamp. Majority of them(especially the singing and dancing ones) look very fake that’s it’s almost hard to watch them Rajeev Nigam, Kunal Kamra, Dhruv Rathee, StudyIQ analysis videos, NDTV primetime, DD News. And a bit of Twitter trends is what you need. i watch kunal kamra's "" shut up ya kunal"" episodes on YouTube. among ask the garbage that Indian YouTube has become- his us one if the sane voices giving a fair v platform for opinions on political matter There are many such political satire shows in almost all of the Malayalam News channels. I think the National channels can take cue from their Malayali counterparts. There was the hilarious Jay Hind on Youtube but they went on hiatus indefinitely. Aib will be back within few month (6 may be idk) If bjp comes to power then RIP media. 'Ye Sab Kya Ho Raha Hai' by SNG Comedy on Youtube is brilliant! Check it out! Check out newslaundry podcasts. Calling Kapil Sharma satirical is like.... Calling shit diamonds. I loved "" on air with AIB"" and loved tanmay bhat. There were better shows before but now all the comedies are dumbed down into major dad jokes with no edge. Even though i often find Kapil sharma funny fun it is just the same old jokes in new packaging. I loved "" sarabhai vs sarabhai"" though it doesnt fit the kind of show you are mentioning but it was a good show at least far better than this "" tarak mehta ka ulta chasma"" stuff. I like the cyrus broacha show right now. No channels in India will allow open criticism of ruling parties. If any journalists goes against them, they will lose job and importance(Sardesai and the NDTV gang). The problem is people in India will watch whatever you show them(like shitty Kapil sharma or alien attack of Arnab barking). AIB did good things but messed with really powerful people and the sentiments of common people. They lost everything. 

 

Another thing is that those who criticize the ruling party, the contents are not good. They sometimes they ignore the obvious facts which makes them not worthy. They stick to some ideologies(in India, common people don't give a fuck about ideologies).

Dude is an honorary army man, supports the army... What's wrong with that? It's just gloves. Trivial bullshit is trivial. I don't mind them asking Dhoni to remove the insignia as long as they don't entertain any other political gestures from anyone else. But the problem is far too many have gotten away with it. Enforce the rule strictly and consistently. Otherwise, their request carries no weight. How does it hurt ? Wtf ? Tributes are done everywhere , I get rules are rules. 
How does cosmetic change affect the game ? 

Can somebody enlighten me ? Yeah they have a point. Dhoni should instead go at the border and fight instead of playing sports if he can't part with indian armies even while playing. Good. request ? he should be fined. whats with request ? if he violated the rules..he should be fined. Social Media is making this matter more highlighted.

From the time we had free and fair elections in Kashmir, normalcy had returned. Most of you do not remember the 90s when the region was tumultuous and insurgent attacks were a daily/weekly event. Mr Vajpayee delivered on his promise to hold free and fair elections and put Kashmir on the path towards normalcy. Having a dialogue helps build bridges and tourism was  trickling back into the region. 

By leaving out all elected leaders from this decision pushes us back decades. This is nothing but a political move by the current central government, just like Demonetization was (just before state elections). They have not thought through this and we as a country will bear the weight of these decisions. I understand that people want better than status quo but when did that become a license to try out any half-baked idea? Correlation does not imply causation.

One can use the same body count stats to 'prove' that Indian counter insurgency operations have reduced terrorism.

Yes, elections were held, but what % voted after open militant threats & what did these parties actually achieve ? Abdullah family & PDP both were allegedly complicit / tacit support for separatists.

I saw this happening once and crossed the road and gave the bus driver a piece of my mind. It was only when I started screaming that others joined in. Be the guy to break the bystander effect.

Lol but also be able to physically fight if you do this. Let me guess, Bengaluru? You have a better chance of survival if you walk to the hospital rather than going by an ambulance. People do all this on the road, and when the patient comes in too late  and couldn't be saved, beat the doctor to a pulp. Today I moved out of the way for an ambulance, a biker who got stuck behind me, screamed at me for being a decent person.

Third front could also be the next one to form the next government with no BJP or Congress at the helm.

 [deleted] Rahul over Modi... anytime I would gladly take Prime Minister Rahul Gandhi over mudi. Mmmmmmm nahhhhh Rahul Gandhi of late has started to 'take decisions' and has backed that with some serious criss-crossing of the country. In short, there's been some serious work and lesser fuck ups (recent incidents like his apparent challenge to all Indian womanhood notwithstanding.) The snub by the BSP-SP alliance underscores his and the Congress' lack of penetration in the Hindi heartland. Up there, Rahul Gandhi's presence is almost seen as a strengthening of BJP because Congress vote share increase can seemingly *only* come at the cost of weakening the BSP-SP vote share. Stories like these (popularity in Kerala) will be heartening to hear for RaGa and INC, but might translate to little in the general elections - the key will still be alliances and victories north of the Vindhyas.


Modi is on a stickier wicket as recent assembly results were a clear message of disapproval. The BJP and Modi know this - so we have open season in the brainstorming room these days. Mandir, Mandal, Gau Chintan, anything and everything is thrown and remarkably sticks on that sanskari whiteboard.


Mayawati will have her one year and five months as Prime Minister, it seems. Rahul Gandhi is an approachable person. He is the kind of dude with whom you can crack open a few cold ones. He has the chance to prove himself now. In my opinion, he should embrace his 'Pappuness' and emerge from the shadows of his ancestors. Better to be a pappu than a feku anyday.

Well, i mean, DUH Doesn't the title mean all Hindus? Don't these groups make up like 80-90% of Hindus anyway? Hindus as we've seen in last couple of elections have become a vote bank for the BJP. Savarnas largely vote for them. OBCs, SCs and STs too vote massively vote for the BJP. Which tells us about the consolidation of Hindu vote bank, that has evolved in last 5 years through highly deplorable measures of projecting Muslims as outsiders and barbaric by the BJP.  And projecting the Congress as a party that appeases muslims which is laughable coz it's completely untrue. But we Muslims understand that narrative, When such a vast majority is radicalised to the extent of electing terrorists and mass murderers you need to understand that in the minds of these genocidal zombies your dignified survival amounts to ""appeasement"".

Muslims are by and large not a vote bank as it is projected out to be. They'll vote for a party capable of beating BJP. If a party other than Congress is in contention which has a better chance of beating BJP. Muslims happily abandon the congress for it isn't much different from the BJP.

                                     -Master Zafar.
I was reading an [article](https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/features/elections-2019-the-ordinary-world-of-kanhaiya-kumar-1556255953373.html) about Kanhiya Kumar and this quote above resonated in me alot. I am the same age as Kanhiya working in a Corporate company, and i feel that what Kanhiya has done is to set an example on how to fight the MAN. He was accused, jailed, beaten, harassed, and humiliated. But all he did was keep standing up after being beaten to the ground with false accusation and intimidation. What was happening to Kanhiya is what happens to anyone who questions authority, and when I say authority i mean in bosses, government, police, RWA members, some old guy in your neighborhood. These people abuse their powers and try every trick in the book to attack you. I have faced these type of people myself and I can guarantee you this that if you stand up and fight you will win, but only if you hold that person responsible. 

Kanhiya Kumar is not only a resistance movement symbol but a symbol of how to respond to authorities. I have seen many leaders but this one stands out. Because he stood against such injustice and attack by the current government and started to rally the masses against the injustice of the government. 

 He not only is able to condense the most complex political issue into a beautiful explanation that everyone understands but is also able to connect with the people listening to him. He says the right things at the right time but can't say if he will be able to survive in that cesspool of hyenas in parliament. But, I am excited to see if he is going to make waves in the parliament or not.

Was it because he was the organiser of the event or was it because the police thought that he was the one with the Bharat tere tukde honge type of sloganeering?

3. Nehru gave himself Bharat Ratna 

4. Gandhi was murdered for creating Pakistan but one of the co-accused Narayan Apte was also involved in 1934 in an attempt to kill Gandhi. There was no Pakistan then. They wanted to kill Gandhi because he wanted to eliminate cast and his ideology of quality

This guy is manufacturing sociopaths. He needs to spend time in a room thinking about what he did. 

On an unrelated note, India desperately needs prison reforms. That’s terrible.

When I don’t do my home work my teacher used to slam me. But it only make sound and no pain,to make other terrifying.

This is abuse.

I am confused though ,who did count the slaps. Badi khali teacher thi I am amazed that the girls took the beating for 6 days. Hats off to her courage. Shame on the classmates who did this to her, they should have protested. My math teacher made other classmates hold me while a classmate slaps me. I was stronger, I freed myself and punched that guy so hard that his right molar fell out. Parents were called, principal saw the footage and told the teacher to not to do it again. The students who held me get 2 days suspension and I get 5 days and detention after school hours. The next year I change classes. My classmates tried to apologize but I just didn't care. the teacher was teaching sadism and brutality, not maths. [deleted] What the fuck. It's like teaching kids to unlearn 'empathy'! At least the kid learnt Math

/s 24\*7 = Jail. My teacher called me bhangi once. Smh What will it take to make them understand than corporal punishment is illegal and it doesn't do shit. 168 is oddly specific My teacher ( who I am sure hated me for no apparent reason) made me bend and touch my heels for the duration of the whole period ( 50 mins). Needless to say I had severe back problems for weeks to come Wtf! Indian teachers are the worst people, 90% of them.

Prakash Raj interview: Mr Modi or Mr Rahul Gandhi is not going to run your constituency,198,bdqhfm,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/prakash-raj-interview-rahul-gandhi-narendra-modi-is-not-going-to-run-your-constituency-5676688/,131,,Dumma1729," He is right to some extent. But most of the times, MPs have to do lobbying for the State and constituency which means currying favours, etc. MPLADS funds is hardly anything to achieve any kind of meaningful progress. >""The responsibility of a citizen is to elect a parliamentarian of a constituency… whichever party he belongs to is not important to the electorate. There are 500+ parliamentarians, it is their job to elect the leader and opposition leader. Just because you want Modi to be elected you will end up aiding a criminal? Or someone who does not work? Mr Modi or Mr Rahul Gandhi is not going to run your constituency.""

>""Your candidate needs to have an idea of the reasons we are at this brink and then a vision with a solution.""

>""The Constitution is so clear. There is no political party in the Constitution. This country is democratic but the solutions should be federal in nature, federal in spirit. We have different languages, different cultures, different geographies. The right people who are elected will definitely elect the right leader."" Wish I was in Bengaluru Central so I could vote for him. Unfortunately my choices in Bangalore South are all shit. We had a interactive session with Prakash Raj last weekend when he visited our apartment. 

When people asked about the infrastructure  issues Mahadevapura is facing and what's his resolution plans are? he didn't even answer any of them. We specifically asked about ""Panathur Bridge traffic situation"" (Google for more info) and resolution, he said - It comes under BBMP and he can't do much there as a MP.

He kept talking about decisive politics being played by Modi and nothing about his plans for Bangalore Central. Most of the people were disappointed by his response. 

At the end of the day people just wanted to know if he will help resolve the traffic deadlock which every residence is facing due to the poor infrastructure in Varthur, Panathur area. Absolutely nothing from his side on those topics. This guy is far too naive. His election pamphlet talks about how there are so many new flats lying vacant and many families are homeless. That's it. Doesn't make a connection, doesn't say how it'll be paid for, nothing. And idealist in a world of cutthroats, social engineers and electoral realists. Will most probably lose his deposit. Will my MP also decide whether we should fight or make peace with Pakistan, or whether we should increase or decrease taxes? The anti-defection law overrides an MP's constituency which means that an MP regardless of his/her personal views has to vote along party lines. 

The only way we can experience true democracy like what Prakash Raj suggests is if there are no parties and everybody everywhere is an independent candidate. Soemtimes I think we should just get rid of the britishsystem and replace it with the presidential system from the USA - they had a 2-faced contest between Trump and Clinton and we're having a 2-faced contest between Modi and Gandhi.

And who is this guy anyways? Some actor? What are HIS qualifacations? I have a choice between 3 time MP  from BJP  vs a weak contestant  from Congress. Other parties don't even stand anywhere. BJP Candidate is a good choice but in a wrong party. I still feel like voting for Congress just to ensure these idiots dont get a majority and do whatever they want to. My vote to Congress wont make Rahul a PM but still BJP needs to be harnessed by the NDA. They were just brutal in last 5 years. They could have done wonders but they misused their majority. I feel, maybe you people might have better views. >whichever party he belongs to is not important to the electorate. There are 500+ parliamentarians, it is their job to elect the leader and opposition leader


In other words, ""Don't want to vote for INC/BJP cuz you don't like Rahul/Modi? Well, guess what, you can instead vote for the people who'd, in turn, choose them as their leader and follow their orders anyway"".

> I think people are making a mistake distinguishing between Pinarayi's ideals and his attitude.

> Pinarayi's supposed ideals may not be liked by everyone - but everyone except actual BJP supporters can respect that. Pinarayi's personality is another matter.

> What is wrong with his personality? Well, if you are not already a fan, he is not a likeable person. He is a leader who came up motivating and organising the party, not in dealing with general population. That may not matter when everyone agrees with him, like in the case of floods. It was the same Pinarayi, but that was a case where there was little controversy, and a strong leader was welcome.

> Sabarimala issue was a controversy no one wanted other than BJP. This issue called for a more humble, gentler kind of leadership. A gentle face is not something people can easily wear, especially people who came up the agitational track.

> I personally liked the strong, confrontational stance that Pinarayi took. Guess what. It did not work. More Obama and less of Bush / Raegan, perhaps? Bomb them all but do it with humility and a smile. And some sadness. Perhaps too much to ask from Pinarayi. This guy should apply same rule for all religions. He is not ready to even implement a High court order against one church faction. Um...no. women were turned back from the shrine during the election season and the only cpm candidate who won, arif, used a picture of the lord for campaigning. I don't see any other narrative that the far left or the left centrist parties can put forward, in order to strongly counter BJP's ideology. Left has been wiped out in the country, except for Kerala, and this kind of makes me wonder if the communist party in Bengal and Tripura will follow the same deterioration that happened to the communist parties in Andhra Pradesh, back in the  70s. Now Communist parties are nowhere to be seen in the state. They just organize a rally once a year and when elections come, they pair up with either of the regional parties and that's it. Once the dominant party in the land, is now secondary to even NOTA.

While it was the caste segregation in AP that eroded its cadre in the late 70s, now it's religious division (primarily) that reduced their vote share in the Bengal and Tripura, partly in Kerala as well. Its been three decades here in AP, since the "" left erosion"" took place and I'm afraid the same will probably repeat elsewhere for them. Kerala is a different region altogether, from both the hindi belt and the influence of populist ideologies but one has to wait and see what approach the right centrist party will adapt for the region.

Unless the communists find a way to integrate both the nationalist approach to the issues at hand, while not compromising on their core philosophy, I don't see them bouncing back anytime soon. Current global scenario ain't any different and they have to realise that the political ground isn't the same as it was in the 50s where the poverty and class division(among many other divisions) were abrupt. Things changed a lot and migration on large scales occurred these last few decades and so the narrative needs to be suited for the same. Of course, there are still marginalized populations, but one should accept the fact that, regardless of which coalition led the governments in the past, they were successful in bringing out large sections into the modern society. Lots can be said about how much more should've been done but there's nothing to gain there. We're in these critical times where, it will probably be more favorable for the ruling coalition to gain more popularity, as we move forward into the future, as the parameters which the populations base their decision of vote are heavily inclined to favor the ruling party. Additionally there's nationalist ideology that is playing a significant role in the process.


 Democracy perhaps was the way forward when the founding fathers drafted the constitution. It was very much the case with all democratic nations around the world. But I think he present global économies need some modified, more appropriate form of democracy that is valid and reasonable to at least our current times. I hope political philosophers here, if there are any in this sub, throw some light here.

Edit : last para is unrelated to the points I made above. Its just a reflection on the political systems in our present world. The same thing that's happening in Bengal will happen in Kerala. CPM will loose next assembly elections. It's cadres will flock to BJP and in time dethrone the Congress too. Commies are done. I like this guy The influx of RSS if not resisted will tear apart the communal fabric in a plural society like Kerala's. In Kerala,there is a lot more comfort between people of different faiths than in many other places, and people dont let their religion get in the way of friendship. This harmony would be at threat from RSS. Dude didn't gave in during Sabrimala row. Massive respect. Probably the best CM in the country today. But it shouldn't.

The state of freedom of expression, 

the anti-national declaration if you criticize, 

the fact that even well educated folks from premiere colleges in this country have turned bhakts, 

the whatsapp and social media propaganda which is destroying the minds of the uneducated and undiscerning once and for all,  (Congress has fast joined this bandwagon, but is still lazy as fuck)

the constant and blatant lies, 

the constant ridicule and demonization of  historical stalwarts like Nehru,

We're not the US where things are decided by the electoral college and popular vote means jack shit. If people of a state want a particular party let them have it. No need to start questioning our democracy just because a party you don't like will win.

People are very angry with this government but are quite and that anger will turn into vote. According to some journalists the BJP is worried that they are going to fall short and its the reason why they have changed their stance from Pulwama to Hindu Muslim but its still not working for them whatever they try its just going against them. So there is still hope we all need to go out and cast our vote to throw this fascist regime out. On one side I fear religious extremism and on the other, Rahul Gandhi becoming prime minister.
