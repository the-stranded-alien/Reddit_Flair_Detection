[Reddiquette] I'm feeling delusional. Am I mentally sick?,33,ak3tt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ak3tt5/reddiquette_im_feeling_delusional_am_i_mentally/,15,"The delusions are telling me that there's a completely different form of reality that I am suppressing. An alternate way of living. And it is saying that it's my current way of living which is delusional instead. To make things clear, I'm referring to illusion by the word delusional. 
I should give you a perspective. I feel I should run away from the current way of life because it is a lot of words and symbols. Like job, future, girlfriend, career, love from other people, wanting to become a writer, wanting to buy latest and most advanced mobile phone and TV etc. I feel like starting from the scratch and rejecting everything world has to offer. I know a few places where even food and living won't be problem. There's therefore this conflict I'm going through therefore.",HarHarGange," Buddy it's that phase of life where you gotta sit and revisit some recent decisions that may have led you to this situation, there is nothing more to it unless you let it get to you. Thanks for checking on yourself and talking about it.

Firstly **forgive** yourself if you think you have done something wrong and in case your social environment has led you to this situation then try and **forget** it. 

The forgive and forget part is crucial, after this just spend a day or two like you usually do and see if it still makes you feel delusional. 

Finally if you still feel delusional then the you gotta consult doctor which is for the best. Absolutely nothing wrong with taking care of your mental health, we often seem to ignore it and make it worse. This is called depression.  Yes, go visit a psychiatrist before it turns into full fledged psychosis. Please visit a psychiatrist and talk about this. That's the best way to get a professional opinion on whether there are any underlying issues.

Also remove any taboo that you may have associated with mental sickness. The mind, like the body can also get sick and there is nothing wrong with it. Dude, this is completely normal! I get these thoughts every morning... But things go normal after breakfast, and when I have to take public transport to office! You mean you’re going through adolescence? Let me get this straight.You realised that the world you live in is revolving around a few words and symbols.You feel that the performances are meaningless or Do you feel that the whole  thing is overwhelming?

I think there's more to it than you've presented. In any case, running away is usually a sub-optimal solution.Think critically, or get somebody who is an expert in critical thinking to help you unpack your idea - possibly a counselling psychologist. Fyki , being a sadhu is not a solution . Its a big scam. Just wondering you username Where is such a place? Like an ashram or some such?  What if you change your mind in the future? There will be no going back. I'd suggest being a part of this world while not consuming all of it if you so wish. Just collect enough resources to live comfortably.",Reddiquette,2019-01-27 03:01:08
"[serious] [reddiquette] [askindia] March End woes, questions regarding rent receipt submission and taxation and legalities.",6,b6uzbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b6uzbt/serious_reddiquette_askindia_march_end_woes/,0,"Hello r/india! I have been living in a non-metro city for past few years and recently shifted jobs (Company A and B) and houses (House H1 and H2) both.

**Backstory:**

Concerned apartment (and other unknown businesses) is/are owned by a lady ""F"", whose husband ""M"" holds an ""Irrevocable Power of Attorney"" for all things owned/operated/etc by F. Account provided to me to transfer rent every month belongs to daughter ""D"" (no idea if it is joint account). M had sent me his HUF PAN card photo before the agreement was done.

Due to some issues, broker who showed the flat was out of picture during actual registration of agreement - which happened at sub-registrar's office and not online. M was never asked to submit his individual PAN or even present F's PAN.

All rent transfers were always online (IMPS or NEFT) from the my same account to the provided D's account.

**Actual Issue:**

From April 2017 to March 2019, I have been staying at the H1. The rent was initially little less than 14k and then after 11 months, me and my owner mutually agreed to extend the agreement (over a phone call), in which he also proposed an increase in rent of rupees 1000/-. Later, in a next call few days later, he asked me to 'pay rounded amount' as the rent which was exact 15k. I obliged to his terms all the times.

Now, when in January 2018, I had asked him for PAN, he said he'll talk to his lawyer and decide. Later, he declined giving it to me. Because I was not in any taxable slab, CA at company A only showed <1 lacs as rent paid and it was fine. This CA was not fine with M's HUF PAN as owner's PAN.

Coming to January 2019, I was confident owner would not provide PAN but still gave a call and to my surprise he said yes. He kept on prolonging actually giving it to me citing ""TDS would be cut"". I told him he's a Self Employed person, so no one is going to cut TDS from him. He still never gave it. LOL. So even for FY18-19, CA at company A used 8000/- as rent paid every month as I was still out of tax slabs (submitted original agreement copy and bank statement - was never asked to submit rent receipts, and no PAN was submitted here).

End on Jan, I switched jobs. Company B CA did not have a problem with HUF PAN and asked me to submit rent receipts with HUF PAN mentioned. Also, when I explained him the scenario, he asked me to address rent receipts to ""M"" instead of ""F"" as I had previously done.

Rent for H1 has been paid until March 2019, but I shifted to H2 (rent 22k) around mid March and paid equivalent rent there too. H2 has a registered agreement from March 2019 which allowed me to shift mid month because of an emergency.

**Important Note:**

I don't care how M or F move their money around (may be in millions, has political family and is from rural west MH).
All I care is saving my money and not paying his taxes - now that I am taxable. And not legally implicated.

**Questions:**

1. Whose PAN should actually have been provided/asked by me during registration of agreement?
2. Submitting rent receipts for first time: Legal issues for forging M's signature (for actual rent paid as he would never give signature voluntarily)?
3. Given that actual registered agreement period was over after 11 months but I was actually staying there for 13 months more and paying electricity bills and rents (all online) prove I was still a resident at the flat?

Question 3 assumes that I get IT query after owner declares signatures forged, declines I was resident or paid rent for period after agreement.

Thanks to all for your time and help.

TLDR: Verbally extended rental agreement has no PAN as owner/attorney does not wish to provide it. Forging signature on receipts for actual rent paid online every time. Implications?",rakhsup92,,Reddiquette,2019-03-29 17:11:37
[Reddiquette] Stop honking Indian's !!,28,87zfur,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/87zfur/reddiquette_stop_honking_indians/,17,"I don't understand why,we Indian's love honking for example I have seen a guy honking at 11 pm at night on a empty road on top of that his Royal Enfield bike had its exhaust blown off.


Government of India should do something about the honking issue man this is lot of noise pollution.",xenomorph2010," I swear. There was this one retard today in an Innova driving behind me. He kept honking the moment traffic slowed down even a little bit. Was stuck behind me for 10  minutes. He kept honking again and again. Seriously wanted to flip him off. Pointless noise pollution.  Even I hate honking, but there have been so many instances where I have seen motorcyclists, bicyclists etc make sudden left or right turns that I feel the need to honk, just to make them aware I am overtaking, while passing them. Once the signal turns green people will start moving , there is literally no need to start honking when the countdown hits 5.. When honking can widen the road then why not It's an overpopulated dystopia, honk hard or drown in the sound. Sad truth. Not just the honking! Fiddling with the dipper during rush hour as if the cars ahead will suddenly dissolve into thin air is beyond irritating. 

 I always give slight honks when making a turn or overtaking or changing lanes and i don't mid other people doing this, what i do mind though is retards honking in heavy traffic as if that's gonna solve anything especially hate those modified loud horns which people add by themselves.

[Reddiquette] Rant about quora,72,7h2uhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7h2uhv/reddiquette_rant_about_quora/,28,"Let me begin by clearing why I use quora. While reddit is great for asking question on various communities, quora is the only place where I can get unironic answers for my questions related to various exams conducted in India. 


But what is up with these Indian quora users? Do they really think that giving a really long answer would make up for the lack of attention they received from the opposite gender in their school college. What is inhibiting them from giving a straight and concise answer to simple straight forward question. 


Now I know that there are quorans who wave around their degrees from IITs and IIMs, but truth be told, rarely I have seen an IIM grad irl who gives such long and lofty answer to anything. They keep it short and simple. The same cannot be said about IITians. Yes I know you worked hard to get where you are, but you don't have to rub it in on someone who doesn't care about your degree and is just here for clearing something up.

Coming back to the rant, does every answer need to be an essay on your life? Also, if I am asking an insightful/technical question of which I happen to know somethings  I am really interested in what I asked. I don't want the googled textbook definition  that you ripped off from a website to sound smart and I certainly don't need all the background information on the topic. For example, I recently came across a question asking if Arnab Goswami is a liberal or conservative. Now this randi quoran gave a 200 word explanation on what it means to be a liberal and a conservative. And then went on to the function of the government. In the final sentence was his answer. THE  ANSWER NEEDED WAS JUST ONE SENTENCE and he wrote 500 word essay. 


Also, the whole of quora is the r/askreddit sub. All the question that get answered are the questions which have nothing insightful.  I remember asking a question about the Rakhine situation, and ended up getting answers from an extremely xenophobic dude, who ranted how all bangladeshis should be killed who come to India. I mean dude, can you even read. I just asked why Myanmar refused to accept Rohingya as it's residents.


Also, what is up with these teenagers giving out life lessons?  They are 18 ffs. They have barely even experienced it. 

Tl:dr; Rants of a madman on quora users. I know there are subreddits such as r/indianpeoplequora and r/rant , however I chose this subreddit since the people at r/rant won't get what I am on about and it isn't exacty r/indianpeoplequora material.",reallyneedafriend," Just use it for your competitive exam related queries and don't use it for anything else. I have facebook just to send some messages or attachments incase whatsapp does not work, don't use it otherwise. 

Edit: Adding to what I said, no site is 100% useful, reddit has lots of shit floating around (in fact I would say majority of reddit is absolute shithole) but we only visit the good parts. Its true for most things in life, use the parts which are useful to you, don't use the rest.  Here's how I use quora, if I have a question I google it. If a quora link comes up as a search result then read answers otherwise don't go to quora.  Mate you have to block like, every single Indian author on Quora along with “India” topic. This is the only way to reduce shit from coming up on your news feed. It took me few hours but it was worth the effort.  on quora, you will notice young people are giving life lessons, advices, experiences.......(which you normally expect from elders)

I' be like ""itna experience laatein kahaan se yeh bachhe""
 Not to mention when indian sapios try to write sarcastic answers when somebody    asks questions about how they are in depression and feeling suicidal. Ah. Nice rant. Let me tell you a story of when I was in IIT Kharagpur 2 years back. ..... r/indianpeoplequora [deleted] a girl once told me that she is cheif on some topic on quora . i have stoppedtalking to her since The psyche of Indians is very limited and this is the fault of our education. I left Quora because of these sapiosexual types increasing in number. I get that you can be sometimes proud of your college or whatever, but to make it as an identity throughout your life is limiting yourself as getting into IITs becomes your sole highest achievement of your life.

This is exactly reflected in Quora and other sites.

Although, I don't want to stereotype every Quora Indian. There are some people who have lived their substantial adult working life in the USA or some other country and still give biased answers against Muslims or minorities of the country they live in etc. This is what is really disheartening. 1.) Qualifications are the only thing most Indians can boast about to compensate for small penis/ovaries or a lack of a non-curated life brought to you by their parents. 

2.) Check the answer, if it has too many links. Then it's just someone trying to get the tiny link juice their SEO achieves from Quora. If that's the case Harsh Agarwal's ShoutMeLoud army at work.
 I found it similar to what you describe however it takes time to correct your feed.

1. Downvote or report every answer you dont think is good enough. Give reasons for reporting. I found out after a few days of downvoting my content changed dramatically.
Indians overtake your feed if you dont downvote or mute them.

2. Follow different authors or accounts. Most Indian authors write similar and it gets boring very quickly.

3. Its changing to a author-centric site as someone mentioned to a collection of people's experiences. If you like reading about them give it a try. I recently followed a guy who used to work in Russian propoganda ministry. Its fascinating to see his writing.

Quora is now mostly a site for people to share their experiences. Factual answers pop up very less. If you like such content, give it a try. Horny saapio virgins trying hard to get into someone's pants. [deleted] Use the mute button liberally.  Isn't your rant a long essay? ",Reddiquette,2017-12-02 22:18:53

After a lot of submission removals for flair abuse, we have merged the ''Entertainment'' and ''Non-political'' flairs to ""Casual"" flair. It will help users to keep it a bit simple when choosing the correct flair. Please use the flair 'Casual' for all links and posts that are of a non-political nature, including images, memes, entertainment related posts and others which do not fall under the other categories.

[NP] tag in the title will automatically assign the new ""Casual"" flair as well. If you have any questions please feel free to post.
",doc_two_thirty," ""Casual"" would look bad for issues with serious matter. just saying Hmm... so... a natural-disaster news will automatically become casual? NO MORE FLAIRS! Why not just stop removing submissions for flair abuse for those two flairs? ""Casual"" isn't any kind of tag. A tag is supposed to be specific, not vague/ generic. Think about the utility of such a tag - why would I ever want to filter r/india for ""casual"" tagged posts? I wouldn't know what outcome to expect.   

Come up with better (highly-specific and filtering-relevant) tags please; take suggestions from members.  it also needs an education/exam related flair or something https://i.imgur.com/XI6gzNH.jpg

""Filthy Casual."" ""Casual discrimination."" ""Perhaps she should have dressed up in Casuals instead."" 

See?

I think this new [Casual] flair is a bit problematic, and may seem insensitive and inappropriate in plenty of situations. Needs a more serious re-think, in my opinion.

Creating more problems than its solving, really. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6jrvsf/filthy_casual_causal_discrimination_perhaps_she Can't we have a drama flair for posts where drama is the norm regardless of whether it's political or non-political. Eg sachin vs Dravid, missal pav vs  vada pav.

Also a shitpost flair for the aunty buys mangoes type posts. Guys, don't remove Non-Political flair. Let it be there. Use Casual only for really casual posts.  One suggestion: For posts that are not tagged, why not auto tag them to something like 'Casual', rather than deleting them?

Sometimes it becomes difficult to flair, while posting from mobile. Can we have a ""History"" flair? Need another flair - Casual Sax Does anybody use flairs?",Reddiquette,2017-06-27 16:17:24
[Np] Reddiquette. You Should Know : The largest combined arms operation after WW2 that resulted in the largest number of prisoners gained after WW2. India's brilliant victory in the 1971 war.,158,2dbsis,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2dbsis/np_reddiquette_you_should_know_the_largest/,107,"The Indian victory against Pakistan in 1971 was one of the greatest examples of operational art and the largest combined arms operation after World War 2. It was a masterpiece of Political objective, Strategic vision, operational planning and tactical execution.


It is important to understand why it was seen as such a great victory. Warfare is usually divided into Positional attrition warfare (think World War 1, Iran-Iraq war or even the India-China war / India-Pakistan war of 1965) or maneuver driven situational warfare. The concept of maneuver warfare was propounded (at around the same time) by various European warfare experts, B.H.Liddel Hart (England) and Mikail Tucahavesky (shot dead by Stalin, and one of THE finest military minds the world has ever seen) was it’s greatest exponent. His theory was, 


Attack on a broad front > use air superiority and arty to make holes in the enemy line > Use this penetration to feed in highly mobile troops who would use maneuver to keep the enemy off balance. The Positional warfare suggests that you can win a war only by crushing the enemies main point of defense (mostly frontally – the British were a firm believer in this theory) while indirect / maneuver warfare suggests that you avoid the strong points, and hit the vulnerable rear of the enemy, keep him off balance, deny him his CCI structure and win the war by using terrain and encirclement (read up on Cannae or Kharkov / Smolensk for examples of encirclement warfare) .


India which had favoured the first theory in all it’s wars till then used the second theory to great effect.


**The Planning:**


In March 1971, Indira Gandhi came back to power with a resounding mandate, and was faced with an immediate crisis! The Bangladeshi refugee problem. A genocide in East Pakistan (estimated deaths vary from 3 million to 4 million) was pushing a massive amount of refugees into India. Her cabinet (especially Defence minister Jagjivan Ram) favoured immediate invasion to settle this crisis and to discuss this, she summoned the CoAS – Sam ‘Bahadur’ Manekshaw. In a very interesting and stormy meeting, she told him to prepare for an invasion of East Pakistan.  Sam Bahadur point blank refused to entertain this and offered to resign straight away. Indira who was used to getting her way, did not like this resistance but asked her advisors to leave the room and had Manekshaw speak his mind freely. He laid down three reasons why he preferred an invasion in the closing months of the year. In this he was going against both Jagjivan Ram and Indira Gandhi  and he was aware of this, but he refused to be a party to a botched up invasion.


•	The Passes with China would be closed because of snow, making it difficult for the Chinese to intervene. In June (when Indira was asking him to invade) the passes would be clear and would need a diversion of efforts to defend these.

•	Monsoon (in this he was proven very right) and the resulting quagmire. The Russian word for it was called “Raptistuta” and means a sea of mud! Mud is the worst enemy for movement (even hard snow can be managed) as it stalls movement to a very low speed. Monsoon would also mean rivers would be in spate so bridging & fording them would be eminently more challenging. August that year saw the worst tropical storm on record till date. It inundated whole parts of Bangladesh and killed half a million Bangladeshi’s.

•	The last was building up a strong and valid cassus belli (cause for war). If India was seen as the aggressor, sanctions would cripple an already crippled economy. It needed to make a case for itself. In the mean time it could use the Bangladeshi govt in exile (based in Calcutta) and the newly created Mutki Bahini to drum up support for itself.

Indira Gandhi agreed to his conditions and set about on a whirlwind tour of diplomacy. She went to Moscow, US, UK & France. She told the governments there that the situation was untenable, but Pakistan was a strong member of the SEATO and CENTO so the western democracies (in a blatant case of hypocrisy) stood by idly while a massive genocide was being perpetrated. Only the USSR recognized the problem, and shipped arms & ammunitions to India to build up her stockpile. India also signed a 20 year treaty of friendship and mutual assistance (this was to prevent any actions by the NATO / US / China)


Mankeshaw then went to work. He created a JIC (IB+RAW+Military intelligence) and a Joint Planning Command (India did not and still does not have a Combined Chief of Staffs like other nations do) to bring the civilians, army, navy and airforce together in the planning. Overall command was given to Lt Gen J.S.Arora who was CiC of the Eastern Command.


**Order Of Battle**


The OOB was as follows, Eastern Command > 3 Army Corps (2nd, 33rd and 4th) > 5 Infantry divisions + 2 Mountain that were on defensive mode. Attached to the infantry divs we had the equivalent of 1 armored division (broken up into regiments). 
Pakistan had roughly 3 Infantry divs and 2 divisions worth of paramilitary and a brigade of armour.


The odds were roughly 2:1 favouring India (conventionally 4:1 was recommended, 3:1 was the bare minimum). In the air India had total supremacy in the east(which was vital) and marginal superiority in the west.


The Mukti Bahini had roughly 60,000 numbers of irregulars. They played the exact same role the French partisans played in WW2 after Normandy. During the war, the Mukti Bahini contributed to the speed of advance of the Indians by providing ready labor and intelligence on the deployment of Pakistani forces. The MB sabotaged Pakistani lines of communication, they struck at weak points (in the rear) with brigade sized forces and caused the Pakistani defence to spread itself thin.


**The Indian Plan**

It was multi layered in it’s approach. Attack in depth to force the Pakistanis to thin themselves out, Cutoff river crossings (to prevent reinforcements and retreat from reaching the Pakistani troops) and finally capture the two key ports in Bangladesh. 

There was one major element of genius provided by J.S.Arora. He changed the Schwerpunkt from the logical south to the more difficult east. The South had it’s base in Bengal, had access to major railway lines and depots and Lt Gen Niazi (Pakistani commander) anticipated the main focus (Schwerpunkt) to be in this sector and aligned his defences accordingly. The East had everything going against it. The main base was inn Tripura, supply / logistics chains had immense difficulties but it was also the closest route to Dhaka. 

J.S Arora allocated the strongest force to the East and the weakest force to the South (the exact opposite of the Pakistani defensive alignment). This has it’s roots in classical warfare including WW2 and the battle of Cannae (which was positional warfare for it’s time). Operation Barbarossa focused it’s Schwerpunkt in the Centre and North while Stavka (Soviet high command aka Stalin) anticipated the key thrust in the South. The German approach to indirect warfare surprised the Russians and caused them a massive loss in men, space and equipment.


**The Pakistani Plan**

Counter offensive in the West and a tiered defense in the East using river lines and cities as strong points (very similar in concept to the Russian defense in WW2 – use river lines and force attritional warfare on the invader. Retreat to city holdfasts and engage troops in urban warfare. Hold out and delay the offensive till such time the UN forced a cease fire (like it had done in the Israeli wars). 

In Bangladesh, Niazi proposed retreating to just outside Dhaka and holding a region around Dhaka (using river lines and Dhaka as a central pivot). The Pakistani establishment rejected this. Once again we have parallels in World War 2. Poland had the option to withdraw it’s forces to the Vistula line, use Warsaw as a pivot and defend a limited area, both these sound ideas were rejected because…”Nationalism”! Not one inch of land would be surrendered etc etc. Niazi went for (as the Indian side had hoped) the WW2 Russian strategy of defending some fortified towns (or as Hitler called them – Festungs) and river lines (bridges). 

The idea was to cut down on the Indian freedom of movement by forcing them to engage in urban warfare. They did make a fatal flaw in their planning. They assumed that India would fight 10 different “Stalingrads”, and never reach Dhaka so they never allocated troops to defend Dhaka (the same mistake Hitler made in WW2 with respect to the defence of Berlin)


**The War**

•	3rd December, Operation Chingis goes in. Pakistan launches a preemptive strike on Indian airfields (in the West). The IAF fights a holding campaign before launching a massive bombardment operation the next morning. In the East, elements of 33 Corps go into action, their objective is to take a vital railway junction. Hilli however was one of the first echelons of Pakistan’s defenses and was very well prepared and supplied. The battle quickly became a battle of attritional warfare, however 340 Brigade spotted an opening in the flank and in a very German Blitzkrieg type of operation, formed combat groups (on the spot) of tanks and infantry and exploited the gap, and these combat groups raced to the river lines that Pakistan had intended to use as defensive strongpoints. Faced with Indians in the rear and forward of them, the resistance quickly collapsed.


•	In the South, using maneuver warfare (as against to positional warfare used by 33 Corp) 2 Corps makes rapid progress, 2 Corps launches a pincer attack using two infantry divisions to envelop Pakistani defences. They keep pushing on towards their target without giving the defenders time to rest and redraw their defensive lines. 2 Corps used the classic maneuver tactics used by Germany in WW2, Israel in the Sinai. They ignored strong points while rushing the rear of the enemy lines (the OMG of Russian doctrine came into play). The infantry pushed on into Pakistani frontline positions who attempted to withdraw to prepared lines only to find them occupied by Indian troops. Defense spectacularly collapsed in this sector. 

•	In the East, 4 Corps (the largest Indian grouping with 3 divisions) and a bold leader pretty much repeated what 2 Corps did. The CO (Lt Gen Sagat Singh) used the Russian concept of Maskirovka and set up a feint attack towards Chittagong, this drew Pakistani defenders (already facing 3:1 odds) to Chittagong weakening their centre. Here we come across a massive feat of arms – Airlifting of 2 entire combat equipped brigades. Rather than contest the Meghna river bridges, Singh sidestepped the exceedingly strong Pakistani defences by getting 2 brigades airlifted and dropped across the river (right into Pakistani lines). The eastern sector was decided as the Schwerpunkt (the focus point of the offensive) and it showed. The Indian troops rapidly outflanked prepared Pakistani positions, artillery was used to bombard these pockets into submission, the IAF flew CAS (Combat Air Support) / Interdiction missions all of which freed the infantry and armour to keep moving. This was classic Blitzkrieg minus only the Stuka sirens. 


The Pakistani forces were in headlong retreat towards Dhaka and this posed a big problem. If they gained the Dhaka region, they could organize a very stubborn defense which would cost 1000’s of Indian lives to capture. To prevent this, 2 Para was dropped BEHIND enemy lines into the region of Tangail. They were very less in number, and if the Pakistanis had grouped up and attempted to fight their way through, 4 Para could have been decimated, but thanks to the Indian Blitzkrieg tactic, the Pakistani C&C set up was decimated and they could not mount a cohesive response. After the drop, the demoralization (and destruction) of organized resistance was complete.


**Psycops**


The Pakistani resistance still numbered in the 1,00,000 and pockets could take a lot of Indian lives to break, so India went on a pysop campaign. Pakistani wirless networks were spammed with “surrender and live” messages (India had cracked the cipher used in East Pakistan before the war itself), Sam Bahadur himself went on air and told Pakistanis that if they surrendered they would be treated honourably, and this cracked any vestige of resistance. Pakistani soldiers began surrendering to the Indian army in droves. Niazi signed the instrument of surrender (a bitter man) on 16th December and went into captivity, along with him 91,000 Pakistani troops also went into captivity.

Even back then, we were spammers.

Great read, though. /r/depthhub Thanks for this awesome post!. I want to know more about Warfare, can you suggest me some books that i can read ? 
  Don't 4get the brilliant operations Trident and Python of the Navy. V crippled the enemy and took no casualties in both operation.  Excellent post! Sam Manekshaw, JFR Jacob, PC Lal... the armed forces were exceptionally well led in that war!

You should start a blog. Reach a wider audience.  Pakistan got spanked in this war, no other way to put it. But aside from the loss of life, I'm glad we lost. Bangladesh should never have been part of Pakistan in the first place, and our leaders were doing them no favors. I don't know how true it is, but a lot of people say that during the war, General Yahya Khan was busy drinking and womanizing.  Thanks for the post. I was really looking forward to read this post once I reach home after work. Why the hell is this stuff not taught in schools. According to our text books we have absolutely no history after gaining independence.

You could have made this post on Independence day. Now you must post another one.  What? No reference to Heinz Guderian in maneuver warfare?! Poda!

But great post though! Interesting read, thanks for this. You should add some sources for further reading.

I read about [Sam Manekshaw](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Manekshaw) yesterday, extraordinary individual with a very decorated history. He even served against imperial Japan in WW2. The Soviet Union was also critical to this victory.  Nixon had sent the 7th Fleet into the Bay of Bengal on day 2 to shut down the Indian offensive via aerial and naval bombardment, but the USSR sent a nuclear sub to tail them, implicitly threatening nuclear war should Nixon do so. Gee thnx OP , not only did you mesmerize me with your narration, you have now I have all these books I want to read !

but seriously, thank you , this was brilliant. I saw a brilliant movie 1971, damn the ending still tears me up. What a brilliant actor Manoj Bajpayee is. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKHd6eZ4TLQ Since a number of people over here are asking for further reads, I would recommend this excellent book - ['The Blood Telegram'](http://www.amazon.com/The-Blood-Telegram-Kissinger-Forgotten/dp/0307700208), less from the Indian perspective, and more of Nixon's phobia towards India, and the resulting policies. I have somewhere read that one of the long term mistakes India made during the war was not capturing Pak/ Kashmir territory when they had the chance (as spoils of war) and instead retreating back to pre war positions, this squandered our effort and gains in the long term Okay I have a mildly irrelevant question: weren't Sam Manekshaw and Cariappa Field Marshals at the same time?  Thank you for this excellent analysis. [A life lived such - Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmPmm7QeIE) While I knew that the 71 war had created one of the largest number of PoWs, the detailed post really gave a lot of insights about the actions on ground. Thanks! Thanks a lot for this. I am very poor when it comes to history like this. Could you hyper link your sources? That way I can find related stuff on the internet. Thanks again. This is the kind of post I want to see in r/India. I love you guys. You should read Col. [David Glantz](http://www.great-victory1945.ru/glantz_3.htm) books/articles on WW2 conflict between USSR and German/Axis powers.

More recently [air cavalry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_assault) concept from Vietnam War and [Air-Land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirLand_Battle) and [Air-Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirSea_Battle) battle doctrine of US 

Some of your analogies to WW2 Germany and USSR could be more nuanced. While principles of maneuver warfare have been around and employed, there is a sea change between nazi doctrine (which was an amorphous collections of principles, often aiming to create a Kesselschlact (battle cauldron) and identifying the SchwerPunkt (focal point of attack) and Soviet combined arms doctrine. These also evolved over time, example [the first battle of smolensk was a disaster for Soviets, as Stalin insisted that they not retreat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Smolensk_\(1941\)) 

1971 Also saw one place in the east where the Indian army had a heavy slog of it with a more or less direct assault against a tenacious Pakistani commander who had taken advantage of local terrain (ditches etc)  . Will try to locate the reference from Bharat Rakshak or wiki. 

Pakistan strategy that defence of the east ""lies in the west"" and reliance on foreign support was shattered by the speed and preparedness of the Indian assault in the east, able diplomacy by India, local support by Mukti Bahini, and sufficient counterblow in the west to create a stalemate there. You might want to make more of a point of it.

One very minor mistake in a good post is the reference to Hitler's mistake in not manning the city of Berlin. This is an underappreciation of the situation at the end of the war and the local geography/times. The battle of berlin was conducted at natural fortification just outside and was one of the bloodiest and desperate battles of WW2. 

Also of note - The Burma campaign that turned back the japanese army has been cited as one of the largest defeats of the Japanese army ever. (guadalacanal was comparable, but viewed as less strategic and including japanese navy). The battle of Imphal and Kohima are under-rated, as is the achievement of the Chindits. Truly, this is the forgotten war. Perhaps partly because it was a British Indian army with british commanders, partly because the Japanese were at the end of their supply lines, partly because Bose was on the other side.  

The battle of [Keren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Keren) (a predecessor of Monte Cassino and Tiger Hill) , and other british indian exploits too warrant mentioning.

Neverthless the 1971 war was extremely notable, for all the reasons you mention and more. Great research but couple of points:

* The Maneckshaw offering to resign thing seems blown out of proportion. No one would seriously suggest attacking rainy flood-prone land in the monsoon. Since time immemorial monsoon has been off season for wars in India.

* All your references are by Indian writers who were actors in the war. ""Major element of genius provided by J.S. Arora"" and written about by J.S. Arora, am I right. Every decision victors make in a war becomes one of genius especially when victors write it. You should read some neutral reports. 

* I believe ""Slender was the Thread"" is about the 47-48 war and does not count here. INDIA IS DA BEST. SO PROUD OF MY CUNTRY.",Reddiquette,2014-08-12 19:48:57
Serious Question to AAP supporters. [Reddiquette],51,2chvdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2chvdi/serious_question_to_aap_supporters_reddiquette/,223,"Do you folks support AK or AAP and what it stands for? If tomorrow in a hypothetical world, the top 4 in AAP get removed in an intra party coup, would you still support AAP?

Or do you support AK, and AAP is incidental? 

",DaManmohansingh," I was a big AAP supporter and supported the idea behind it. Almost everything AK did pre-Delhi elections was in line with the idea. He then tried to become a politician. Something he is not good at. Congress dragged him to their level and beat him at it.

The coalition with Congress was his political hara-kiri. I support AAP in general, although I think AK is the main driving force in the party. I would still support them if the top 4 get removed, because I think they believe in something, and if they follow the same policies, I am fine with it. Although, I think AK is the reason they draw such crowds, he is pretty good at what he does.

Although I may disagree with some of their policies such as the anti-nuclear power stand. Also the unnecessary support for Gaza.

I still think they are the best thing to have happened to Indian politics. Being clean and corruption free is the most important thing, in my opinion.

Unfortunately, that is not the case in India. The corrupt and the thugs are rewarded, while the nice guys are sidelined. AAP is really necessary in Indian politics, more to keep the main parties in check.

AAP is the only party in support of bringing accountability for political parties. Both BJP and congress will never support RTI for political parties.

AAP is the only party which seriously opposes criminality in politics. You can see the hypocrisy in both BJP and congress where they provide lip service but when its their turn to implement it, they'll say its just ""politics"".

So as long as AK/AAP stand for cleaning up politics and jail the corrupt politicians, I will support them. We need AAP.

This is how electoral discourse happens in India now :

> INC: Hey BJP, You did X. That is bad.

> BJP: But INC, you did Y. Which is worse.

At the end, nothing gets done about X or Y. The two parties replace talking about the issues & instead talk about which 1 is holier.

AAP, with small history, can break this cycle. I will support anyone which brings the bill of swaraj.  As for Ak and just modi..  I some how trust them both to take a decision for the nation.  I didn't have that feeling for Congress or shiv sena or any other party. 

Some how after modi is done,  I don't trust anyone.. 

Ak has had for long been against the government and now he is trying to be the government to change it.  

If the 49 days was any indication then I will for a thousand times donate and trust them with my vote  [deleted] >Or do you support AK, and AAP is incidental?

It's the other way around. If AAP had some other leader I would still support. However, AK turns out to be quite an able administrator, apart from a few things like showbaazi and stuff. Having known his history and achievements, I can assuredly put my faith in him to do what he believes in. 

Transparency in functioning, anti-corruption stance, RTI, right to recall are all the principles that I strongly subscribe to and there I am not aware of a single political party that stands for them other than AAP. It's really the lack (or even the presence) of a non-shady political party that makes my support for AAP stronger.  

And as long as the core principles of AAP remain the same, any fallouts in the leadership is not gonna affect my support. I personally support the founding principles of AAP, to be a force to end corruption and bring accountability to government functioning.  I also think that both BJP and Congress are corrupt (to varying degrees), and don't have any incentive to end corruption.

I think a party like AAP even if they don't win a majority can be a voice of reason within the parliament.

So regarding your first query, I will keep supporting AAP through donations because they are my only source of hope in this muddled democracy.

As far as AK is concerned, I don't think he is a power-hungry maniac as some people tend to believe. They did make some mistakes like resigning from the Delhi government and trying to fight across India in general elections.

He basically tried to expand too fast, without having a robust fundamental structure in place. He failed. Many people saw this as an excellent opportunity to hit him when he is down. Obviously, pissing off the media and industrialists like Mukesh Ambani did little good. They went after him when they saw the opportunity post-elections.

I strongly believe he has the best interests of the country in mind. I also believe is a man of high integrity. He is interlinked with the AAP movement, and there is no separating the two.

So yes, I will keep supporting AK as well.
 yes i will still support AAP if it is lead by a person of clean image.I see only changing the current political scenario as respite from my troubles.the JLB,swaraj and their transparency regarding funds is good. TBH I don't support AAP. I just don't think they deserve much of the hate they get based on no facts. So to clear a few things:

1. AAP is no more a Congress B-Team than BJP
2. AAP is not full of Kashmir separatists
3. AAP is not a Maoist party

I have no idea how people believe all this crap. [deleted] [deleted] I support Both AAP and AK. both go hand in hand. Question is asked to create a distinction between AK and AAP. I hope you are not Arnab Goswami. 
 [Reddiquette] does nothing, it should be [R]

And with the Politics tag, you cannot have a [R] enforced thread, unless something changed I will always support AK.

I request all to **plzzzz** read this http://www.rmaf.org.ph/newrmaf/main/awardees/awardee/biography/141 So, is the person bigger or the idea? I support both (and I can't digest the fact that people are sticking to the traditional corrupt, communal parties). AK is not extremely intelligent (and may say stupid things from time to time), but his heart is at right place and he did things consistent with the principles of AAP (except the Delhi house thingy, which is a minor infraction). AAP does not matter . Its the idea they bring that matters. 

THe IDEA is integrity , accountability and 0 tolerance to corruption.  

I see humility to accept their mistake publicly and change. 

I see their stand for the community. 

And I also see all the behind the door strategies to subdue them. 

India could be a golden bird again and people would line up to migrate to india rather that other way around THIS IDEA came into existence. 
 I loved the idea, the movement and the support. I joined rallies, shouted slogans and actually celebrated when they won Delhi.

Then congress happened. And then 49 days. 

Lost faith.  To be honest, i don't know what they stand for anymore. They messed up big time after forming the government in Delhi. Some of their decisions regarding power and water supply were good but the weird agitation and antics (of Somnath Bharti and few others) seemed like they were trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator.
Before the Delhi elections, my dad was invited to one of their meetings. He said most of the people there were former BJP and Congress members. I just think AAP and AK both are not mature enough to rule. I can be wrong, but this was my personal feeling while voting in 2014 Lok Sabha.  I imagine if anything removal of Kejriwal, Salim Yadav, Bhushan, Sisodia, Ashutosh etc. would be a bonus.

But seriously speaking, even with these faces gone, what exactly does AAP represent? Anti-corruption? Okay, but what are their policies. A repeated subject of criticism is that their members come from all idealogical backgrounds from left to right(or, from Medha Patkar to Meera Sanyal) and as a party they have very few clearly defined policies and viewpoints.

Also their frequent Muslim appeasement, sometimes going to ridiculous levels(eg. Holding concerts and candlelight vigils for Gaza when the public is more concerned with Saharanpur and other domestic issues) really gets on many voters' nerves. Similarly the fuss they made over Batla House and 'open letter to Muslims' last year was a turn-off for many voters. I'd be more willing to support them if the top 4 got removed. There are probably a lot of decent people who are working for AAP and they are ones who should be running the party, not attention whores like AK. ",Reddiquette,2014-08-03 19:50:19
"Not a hater, but what happened to Swacch Bharat? (Reddiquette)",59,3zkjpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3zkjpo/not_a_hater_but_what_happened_to_swacch_bharat/,46,"I'm genuinely curious, because IIRC the government invested a LOT of money towards the program. Maybe they're doing work, but its not the media anymore.

Again, not a hater - I support Modi's economic vision.",ramukakaforever," The fact that you had to preface a statement with ""Not a hater"".... It is ongoing but at a very slow pace. I see a few public toilets in the Mumbai Hyderabad high way within 2km stretch which was surprising. But it's not happening as fast as it should. The UPA had a similar Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan program, which was a failure. [CAG even found alarming discrepancies in fund allocation and its misuse and also a clear failure in the implementation of the sanitation program.] (http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-nirmal-bharat-abhiyan-total-failure-cag-2153561)

Swachh Bharat, in all likelihood, is going the same way. Atleast to me, there is no visible outcome or change.

PS: Why do you have to keep justifying that you are not a hater, (not once but twice)? Ask your question boldly. If someone accuses you of something you are not, just ignore. No need to be this defensive that too upfront. What happened? 
People still blaming government for not doing thier job and continue to litter. 

One time, one of my uncle was driving me around in Delhi NCR. He was surprised to see that I kept my trash in my hand for hours until I found a trash can to throw it. When I asked the reason, he said I would have thrown it out from the window long time ago. He even told other people about it. 

 http://swachhbharatapp.tumblr.com/

http://www.dnaindia.com/topic/swachh-bharat-mission

There are other updates too, just Google it. You are paying another tax now, that's what happened :) what else were you expecting :) In my town Belgaum Karnataka 

All pan shops have been given a dustbin to put outside their shop. 

Bus stand got cleaned. Railway station is clean. But the city is still dirty as usual. But I don't blame that on govt they clean dustbins and open dustbins daily. But a lot of opeople who still open gutka packet put it in mouth and throw the cover on the floor while standing next to a dustbin. They have also started a new drive for smokers they are giving metal pots for cigarette buds and told pan shops to enforce it some have some havnt Did you not see advertisements with Anupam Kher today? I don't have a clear idea about the cess. How does it work?

The funds from the cess go to Swacch Bharat Abhiyan; that much is clear.

So, how does a central government program seek to influence the efficiency of waste disposal and management at panchayat level and municipality level?

Is Swacch Bharat a cleanliness program or an awareness program about cleanliness? Swacch Bharat Cess is still there, I think. The campaigning is there no more, I think. Imho large ambitious culture changing government programs always fail. From 'big leap' to Jimmy Carter's attempt to reduce fossil fuel dependence they havr always always failed. 

Swachh Bharat can work as a branding exercise for several different infra improvement projects but I can't see how it will really bring any changes beyond that.  They are working not talking.  I don't know about anyone else, but where I live, this ""Swacch Bharat"" thing has failed miserably, completely.

The only thing that has been cleaned is the mayor's house, that retarded goon likes to litter his own place and then take photos of himself holding a mop. And then once his home is cleaned, the retard keeps claiming it as a remarkable achievement and first step to Swacch Bharat. Checking on this thread after 15 hours: the consensus seems that we should not litter. 
--
I still can't figure out the point of allocating crores when there's no unique problem solving for India's trash problem / our tendency to litter. more tax & seasonal topic for selfies/tweets.

Did you expect more than that ? Still people are loitering the spaces as before. Though Modi did a good job of bringing swacch bharat campaign he should have stopped the campaign with educating people to be clean and aware of cleanliness of their surroundings. Instead he started to impose swacch bharat cess which is not a good thing to do. Publicity should be given for swach bharat no doubt in that, but taxing people in name of swach bharat not good.

Reddiquette : On Israel,4,25ussa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25ussa/reddiquette_on_israel/,35,"I made some obviously controversial statements that set many a knicker ablaze, didn't want to go about responding to each and every one of these individually, and also thought it would be good to have fresh thread talking from the non Israeli Pov.

Before I start - seriously, I now understand how it feels to be at the receiving end of my right wing brethren, I have been called an anti-Semite (how, questioning a country's policies and it's government makes me an anti anything is beyond me), weed smoking hippie, delusional Palestinian apologist amongst other stuff, my question to you folks who insist on needless ad-hominem is this, 

Can't one have a view which is contrarian to yours? Must everybody see the world only from your prism? Why needless ad-hominem? Everybody can indulge in it, but what would be the outcome? We would only be slinging insults at each other which mean nothing in real life and civil discourse is given the go by.

Once more onto the breech!!! but before I substantiate the claims I had made, some commonly repeated lines of reasoning need to be rebutted.

**Israel is surrounded by enemies & it's very survival is in question, so it has the right to do whatever it feels like doing**

* This was true in 47, this was true in 67 (which is where the seeds of the current conflicts were sown), but it is absolutely not true in 2014 (or not for the past 25-30 years at the least).

* It's major opposition has been completely neutralised - Egypt? It has a peace accord which both have respected, likewise Jordan, Iraq is out of the equation, Iran's nuclear plans have been neutralised and while on paper it remains a credible threat, the reality is that the whole world knows, if Iran even makes a hint of a hostile move in this region against any country, let alone Israel, it will feel the full impact of the US military (and maybe NATO as a whole)...so Iran is clearly not a threat. That leaves us states like Lebanon (which has it's own problems, largely caused by Israeli policies, and has shown that left to it's own tends to gravitate towards a fairly tolerant model).

* In terms of defence budgets, in terms of quality of manpower, training, equipment (all Uncle Sam's blessings mostly) the IDF is far and away miles ahead of it's closest competitors, so this whole ""Israel under siege"" nonsense needs to be put to rest.

**Israel is this utopia for Israeli Arabs**

* At the outset, one cannot but be blind to the fact that Israeli arabs have far more rights in Israel than in any other major Islamic country, only a fool will deny it, but it still has some serious questions raised on how Israeli arabs are treated as second class citizens with serious cries of even an almost apartheid like state in many areas and there are moves to constitutionalise this in the form of the [Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_proposal:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People), [some more on this](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/04/binyamin-netanyahu-israel-jewish-state).

Historically this goes against what it's founder David Ben Gurion wanted - he wanted (and had his way when the constitution of Israel was framed) Arabs to be treated equally, and no discrimination at all to be practiced. At the time Israel was formed, he went all out to assure Arabs that they will be treated well in Israel and requested Arab's to stay back in their villages and homes. Now in a classic case of fear mongering (similar to the one in India), Muslim leaders warned of a genocide of Arab's & Muslims and succeeded in winning over their people and thus began a massive exodus.

This hawkish stance of Israel in recent times is what I as an observer of that region deride - if when truly surrounded by enemies, Israel could afford to be magnanimous, what is the need now to disenfranchise Arabs? How different (in spirit if not in actual themes) is this different from the [Nuremberg laws?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws)

How can, *Arabs are second class citizens in Israel, but are better off than in other Arab countries ever be an excuse for this discrimination*? Is Tu quoque ever a solution? When a country like Israel with it's history of treating Muslims, Arabs well (Israeli) over time becomes exceedingly hawkish and discriminatory, does it not require wide condemnation? 


Now, to address the points I had made.

**Israel consistently violates agreement's it has signed or agreed to sign in negotiations with the PLO / Palestinian Arabs**

A couple of Wiki links on stuff like this alone will not suffice, they barely even scratch the surface of the reality that is Israel's duplicituous and perfidious stance when it comes to dealing with the Palestinians.

Let me as an example address Madrid. /u/pbdirigible says no agreement was signed in Madrid as that is what Wiki will tell you.

Reality went like this,

* As a precondition to Madrid, Israel wanted a UN resolution - resolution # 3379 struck off it's books (revoked), the US and the Arabs agreed to this and it was done.

* Yizhtak Shamir then wanted an unconditional loan guarantee of $ 10 billion from the US (which was later given without any fuss to the next Israeli regime to form the government), but the Bush proposal of wanting specific guarantees from Israel on troop reduction from the occupied territories was outright rejected. Bush stood firm on this, and Shamir had to back down.

* Then came the new effort at stalling the process - Shamir and Israel outright rejected PLO negotiators (though PLO was as per the previous resolution 3379 granted observer status and was the defacto political entity representing the Palestinians), he got his way.

* Then Israel played it's final trump card - Madrid won't see any Israeli negotiation, but it will broadly agree on the items to be negotiated (troop withdrawals, and Israeli withdrawal from the illegally occupied territories). These two items had been a condition of the ceasefire after the Yom Kippur war - [Resolution 242](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242) and [Resolution 338](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242), the Palestinians (secretly operating on behalf of the PLO) agreed. By this time Shamir had lost the elections (he was seen as too hawkish even by the Israeli's) and Rabin had come to power - he said **Israel WILL HONOUR it's commitments, and slowly start phased troop withdrawals and got the $ 10 BN loan**...and then promptly Israel went back on it's words. It did hold 5 other parleys, in which they stalled the entire process (Palestinian demands were simple, do what Israel has repeatedly promised to do) till it collapsed without anything emerging from it.

This level of duplicity was then seen in Oslo, to go into that at length would mean too much of a digression, but suffice to say that Israel played the same game of making promises (This time in an accord, so no disputing it) and then promptly going back on them. From the previous parleys and UN resolutions, Israel forced Arafat to something called three tier zones - in which Palestinian self governance was recognised ONLY in Zone A which was a very truncated area, this buried all Israeli promises, UN resolutions, Security council resolutions finally - of course, now, they are encroaching onto even zone A.

I will keep adding to this post as it is taking me time to draft these. I hope that my rabid right winger bretheren cool down on the ad-hominem, don't call me a pot smoking hippie who pulls stuff from his arse and respond with facts, figures and opinions formed out of those.

Interestingly enough, I was also a hard core Israel supporter till 5-6 years ago, when a lot of reading from the Palestinian perspective gave me a whole lot to think about.

Some must read to get a balanced perspective (if you are interested in a balanced perspective that is)

* [The Great War for Civilisation by Robert Fisk](http://www.amazon.in/The-Great-War-Civilisation-Conquest/dp/1400075173) - This is a MUST READ for anybody interested in understanding the politics in the Middle East

* [Lords of the Land](http://www.amazon.in/Lords-Land-Settlements-Occupied-Territories/dp/1568584148/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400410129&sr=1-1&keywords=Lords+of+the+Land%3A+The+War+Over+Israel%27s+Settlements+in+the+Occupied+..) - the paperback is atrociously expensive, but most uni libraries stock it, or the Kindle version is only Rs 500 or so.

* The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A History by Ian Bickerton - provides some solid insight into the roots of the conflict. I paired this with some fictional work by Leon Uris, gave me a good flavour for the period.

* Fictional works by Leon Uris (just for the flavour, he does some solid research)

* Israel the West Bank and International Law - The definitive work on the legal aspects (various UN resolutions, the whole legality of the Israeli occupation etc), a little dry, but interesting if you can break through the whole dry style.

Note - I have referenced Wiki as a starting point, but my main citations would be from the books I have referred, though please don't expect me to start quoting page numbers - I am not quoting directly from these (and other books I have not mentioned here), but my ideas and opinions were framed by these.

It might be a sweeping generalisation, but in my opinion, the right wing support for Israel is only because of the fact that the oppressed people are Muslims. If they were Hindus, the situation would have been completely different. 

I fail to see how a state which routinely razes down Palestinian homes and has brazenly driven out people from their own country can be considered anything but inhumane.  [deleted] One of the major issues with understanding the actions of the israeli gov't is that people try to make a general sense of the conflict and sometimes even try to find patterns in the rhetorics used by both sides.

The sad truth is that in the middle east trying to generalize and find patterns doesnt work. israelis and arabs from in and around the region (and im talking specifically about the [Mashriq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashriq) region)
are divided in most cases. arabs who live in ramallah come from different hamula(family) then arabs who live in jenin or jericho and some cities are basically shared by 2-3 families that have conflict with other families from other cities and using assault rifles to solve those conflict is pretty common.

most arab villages have 1-2 families in them and in some cases they wont even let their girls marry with people from other villages.

Different arab families immigrated to israel in different times and their social and financial status reflect that.

israelis are divided by countries of origin and the year they immigrated to israel. jewish-israeli citizens who experience the tensions can even spot them in political decisions and economic trends.

Those issues make it almost impossible to have an unbiased academic research on culture or history within the region.
the amount of information you need to understand the region is too big and without living in israel and experiencing day to day life in different parts of israel i dont see how anyone could understand whats happening here.

 >Before I start - seriously, I now understand how it feels to be at the receiving end of my right wing brethren, I have been called an anti-Semite (how, questioning a country's policies and it's government makes me an anti anything is beyond me), weed smoking hippie, delusional Palestinian apologist amongst other stuff, my question to you folks who insist on needless ad-hominem is this

 
That's because a good part of all deeply anti-Zionist people are most of those things. Not all of them, not even the majority, but a good non-token part of them, they are antisemites embarrassed of their antisemitism using zionists as their to-go word for everything wrong in the world. Same thing with everything else, basically, nowadays being a racist is not ""cool""  so people hide their racism in ways that are socially acceptable (misogynists don't hate women anymore, they hate feminists; xenophobes don't hate brown people anymore, they hate Islam, and so on. Not all the people who hate feminists and Islam are misogynists or xenophobes, but a good part of them are). 

You, on the other hand, seem like a smart person who simply but respectfully disagrees with me and my worldview. Which is why I upvoted you, even if I'm one of the most right-wing Israelis on reddit as a whole; good debate can and should be had, but good debate is not spamming a YouTube video of definitive proof of a Rothschild Zionist conspiracy to control the world. 

Or to give you another example, somebody like yourself would be very welcome to post in r/Israel and debate about whatever you want, as you are a rational person with a different mindview. Somebody like this person http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25rnou/israels_prime_minister_netanyahu_congratulates/chk7jhf would not be, as he is most certainly an antisemitic asshole hiding behind good old Zionism to post his shit.  > receiving end of my right wing brethren..Please point me to the specific thread. I'd like to know about what the views of this ""right wing brethren"" are. 1. You referenced ""Israel's Constitution"".  In fact, Israel does not have a constitution.

2. Why did Arafat walk away from the Clinton Parameters in 2000-01?  Read what Bill Clinton wrote on the subject.

3. Without Palestinian recognition of Israel, as a Jewish State, in whatever borders are agreed to, the conflict will not truly be over.  Only an agreement that ends all present and future claims on both sides will be worth the paper it is written on.

4. Discrimination--it exists in Israel and in many other places, and is extensive in India. So long as Israel and the Palestinians are in a state of conflict, you should not be surprised that it exists.  To compare it to the Nuremberg Laws indicates you may not know too much about them.  Sorry if I am being honest.  Bear in mind, as well, the rhetoric about Jews and Israel used in Palestinian media?  Also, did it ever occur to you to ask the Palestinians what they want and are willing to accept?    You might find that it is not at all what you ASSUME they would agree to.  

BTW, have you ever had a look at the PEW global attitudes survey?  

Full disclosure--I support the Clinton Parameters and the likely Kerry Plan, and don't at all like the current Netanyahu regime.  I also think if an agreement based on the Clinton Parameters is not possible, Israel should unilaterally withdraw to the security wall.  I agree, mostly, with the basic spirit of what you write and am sure you are well meaning. I can only suggest you think more about what the Palestinians really want and are willing to accept, not what you imagine they want and also, whether the current situation is not a consequence of the failure of the Camp David/Clinton Parameters talks?    
 Don't know much about the subject,  except that I like Israel,  and I support it's political decisions

Depending on the technology the max amount of bandwidth available for ""Public use"" is a fixed amount. Let's for sake of discussion, equate Bandwidth = Money. India has already shown that Socialism is a failed concept. i.e equal money to all is foolishness and gives rise to corruption and is basically, a disaster  that would take years to be recovered from. So why would it be better in case of internet? Wouldn't it be much better if more bandwidth is allocated to services that is necessary for public rather than services that are entertainment for public. Like say, wouldn't it be more beneficial if more bandwidth is provided for Hospitals, Defense, Emergency services etc, rather than say, Netflix or porn sites? Lets talk about future, suppose a service like Netflix is started in India, which becomes so famous, that almost, 50-60% of population is on Netflix on sunday, using more than 50-60% of total bandwidth available with that technology, wouldn't it decrease the bandwidth of an emergency service, or Hospital, or research lab, or defense services.

",hoodunnit," Gary Bass' Blood Telegram. It points out how Nixon and Kissinger basically closed their eyes, allowing Yahya Khan have his men run amok through Dhaka. There was an overflowing refugee crisis (larger than the Syrian refugee crisis) we are talking about, and India was facing the brunt.

The book has excellent transcripts of conversations between Nixon and Kissinger. Nixon basically calls Indira Gandhi a bitch at one point, and hated her because she never much treated him with reverence when he visited India and met her a decade or so before he became the president.

Cong Men shut down the eatery opposite KEM Hospital over bill note,172,1iuxg0,http://www.mid-day.com/news/2013/jul/230713-congress-men-shut-down-eatery-over-bill-note.htm,135,,estranged_gnrs," So apparently Congress party members could not handle some criticism. Well no surprises here

- they expect news anchors to remain mum when their party members justify terrorism, 
- they expect opposition and media to turn the other way when being called soft on Chinese incursions, 
- they expect media not to raise questions about their party members's complicity in scams because matter is sub-judice and calling things a media-trial, 
- they expect people to not call out their hypocrisy when lokpal needs ""all-party-concensus"", but food security bill that can put tremendous pressure on the already bad inflation can be put thru an ordinance because ""bribe to people"" is the only way to win elections now, 
- they expect us to believe that only others are communal, but they, the most communal of all are ""self appointed"" certificate authority of the secularism in the country

Edit: 
Just for [comparison sake](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-01/mumbai/37372247_1_ac-restaurants-service-tax-restaurant-owner) the service tax (luxury tax) is approximately 5% of the entire bill. In a country like India with not-very-great tipping culture, even the tip to a working class waiter will be less than 5% of the bill amount. But, approximately 5% of the entire food bill goes to the coffers of a corrupt government who will eventually end up making a multi-crore scam out of it and make the money vanish instead of using it for public good.  This was a harmless expression of social protest. He wasn't hurting anyone high up in the Congress, no thousands of people were queuing up and chanting slogans here, not even another political party was interested in what was happening here.

It's a really sad day that Congress felt the need to go and snuff this out. The insecurity, the arrogance ... its mindboggling. The guy so calmly said that this was all done by non-legal channels and he should express himself through legal ways, WHILE using his political clout to get his shop closed. Over a goddamn two line statement at the end of a fucking bill. >Youth Congress leaders expressed surprise that **despite all the work they put in for the greater good of the people, some failed to notice it.** “We are doing such good work in our areas as part of the Youth Congress and such comments de-motivate people from joining the party.

Oh boo-hoo, let me play you a sad song on the world's smallest violin. Wow! Taking on a small business for some harmless fun is the way to go. And they talk about moral policing of the BJP all the time. Can't blame the owner removing those lines, he's got a business to run. NSUI, eh?

Let me just leave this news article about the NSUI Mumbai wing president from last month :

http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/1831516/report-nsui-mumbai-president-suraj-thakur-suspended-for-dirty-dancing This reminds me of an incident in the 80s. A ""talent show"" on All India Radio was hosting some children, and the host asked a child to recite a poem. The child went ""Gali Gali me shor hai, Rajiv Gandhi chor hai"" (Roughly translated, every one knows, Rajiv Gandhi is a thief).

Congress workers beat up the host, and had him fired from his job. Didnt save Rajiv's govt in the next elections though. Fuck, Never in a million years would  I have thought my post in reddit would have such undesirable consequences. I guess I have to blur out the name of a person or institution who insults congress next time I post.  NUSI goons are worse the VHP goons. Fuck them  Literally no hope for the nation when you have a ""youth"" party doing this. At least when it comes to the old guys, there is the hope for change when they die off.

Ah who am I kidding, mera bharath mahan!

EDIT - How in the bloody hell is this defamation??  >The owner might have his issues but he should fight them in a legal way rather than defaming the party for some people’s corruption,” said Sandeep Pansade, general secretary, south-central region of Youth Congress. 

Yes, why, of course Mr. Pansade. Because freedom of speech is superseded by the archaic IPC! And you guys wouldn't love to change it.

And good for you Congress, that a large section of the Indian population still believe you will be the last ones to encroach upon their freedoms! An **anonymous** site owner complained that **alleged** NaMo fans threatened him to shut down a satire site (a copied one at that). No proof was given for that and still all hell broke loose. Commentaries were being passed, editorials were being written, TV-debates were being organized ,verdicts were being passed -- all in all the outrage industry was in full flow..

Now **Congress goons**, **IN REAL LIFE**, force a restaurant to be shut down because the hotel had the gumption to print certain **bitter truths** in their bill footer. The livelihoods of many people have been directly affected. Now will the outrage industry please put up its hands ? 

I guess not. Because as loyal dogs, you are expected to bark only when the master tells you to. Congress the haat aam aadmi ke saath. 

Criticize congress and then their haat is in your gaand.  Liberal towards whom? Certainly not this eatery owner.. Fuck! I feel so powerless. 

I wonder what *we* can do about this. Oh, for THIS they act immediately. When shit that actually matters happens, the reaction time difference is astonishing. Does Amartya Sen have an opinion on this now?  Congress pet pooches already [swinging into action](https://twitter.com/waglenikhil/status/359553362158555138) It's pouring in Bombay, there is apathy on the road in the form of traffic, train delays etc and yet these Congress workers chose to focus their energies on pulling down this restaurant than help commuters stranded everywhere.

Speaks volumes on the governance system in Maharashtra right now. When you get shut down for speaking about criminals, you are being ruled by criminals welcome to democracy ! why the downvotes? Pakis at it again? I am pretty sure the eatery will be back - but these guys are super assholes for not having the balls to take criticism. Can't blame them, its in the party's genes. Congress, Shiv Sena...they're all the same. There is no true protection for freedom of speech in India, unfortunately.  Jusy came to comment I fapped to many a Mid Day girls in days past. Carry on **Congress is secular** *^only ^when ^it ^comes ^to ^destroying ^the ^country ^and ^betraying ^the ^citizens. Ask help of sena. We are so used to this shit now that we don't even question how they could legally do this and whether a court will support them. All we ask is why they did it. now can we start the revolution?  i mean we the people are becoming a joke.  we will take anything from anybody.

we should stop trying to influence others and debate endlessly and just find like minded people and start our revolution. Freedom of Speech in India is just a concept, not reality.

http://www.bbc.com/news/business-20590169



This lead me to a link from Infosys, 
http://www.infosys.com/finacle/solutions/thought-papers/Documents/why-India-needs-islamic-banking.pdf


Here is why we actually need it:

1.  Interest free loans to all, No bank fees
2.  Could ethically be appealing to the Poorest Sections of India -         Muslim

Please Do read the Infosys report before commenting, the two reasons above are primary reasons why it would make sense

About me: brahmin hindu, born  and living in Mumbai since 1994. 
 

I want to know what, R/india thinks about this,

These may also lead to communal violence  which makes me wonder that if these banks will be target if there are problems in the city. ",dinonia," From all that I have read about the implementation, there is no functional difference except for terminology by calling interest as profit. 

Edit:

The infosys report cites twocircles.net as a reference. Also here is a report, [Islamic Banking is a Myth](http://www.dawn.com/news/881273/islamic-banking-is-a-mere-myth) on it from Dawn.
Also this by the tribune, [Is Islamic banking as exploitative as conventional banking?](http://tribune.com.pk/story/538577/is-islamic-banking-as-exploitative-as-conventional-banking/). Pakistan has these banks already that is why I am citing their papers. Though i don't support it. There is already one Muslim bank. It runs with support of Hdfc bank. People have a large misconception about Islamic Banking. This is due to the fact that everybody tries to provide opinions without understanding what Islamic Banking is. 

No, it does not provide any advantage to Muslims. All it does is provide a loophole to muslims because interests are forbidden in Islam.

Let me give a small example of how it works.

Say, you are buying a car for 6 Lakhs and you decide to take a normal loan. He might put around 15% interest rate over 4 years and the EMI would come to around 15,000 per month. You end up paying 8 lakhs over the course of 4 years. In this case, you are buying the car directly from the dealer.

Now, in Islamic Banking, you don't buy the car directly from the dealer but through the bank. What this means is that the bank buys the car from the dealer and then sell it to you. The banks doesn't sell you the car for 6 lakhs but they would sell it to you for a higher, fixed amount - say 8 lakhs. This 8 lakhs would be split into monthly installment. So, in effect you are not paying any interest technically. 

Both normal banking and islamic banking would more or less cost the same to the customer. It just makes the process legal under Islam How do they make profit?, to the OP: would encourage you to not shout or whisper about your caste .... the sooner we get rid of our caste tags (branded on us by birth) the better the country will progress !   

how does it sound if you declare yourself as ""caste-less"" ?   <apologies for deviating from the topic !> Yes, interest free loans are sure to help keep inflation down. (sic)
Also, why do you have to state you are a Brahmin?

We believe we had already invented, eons ago, all things that modern science purports to have recently discovered, thus proving our superiority, hence we do not have to answer to anyone or to bow to discipline.

[Reddiquette] Why is Modi the only one being accused by his detractors of being dictatorial?,2,23urs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/23urs1/reddiquette_why_is_modi_the_only_one_being/,7,"I hear this often, that he is dictatorial, that he allows no dissent etc [one such example](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140322/jsp/opinion/story_18095590.jsp#.Uz00e_mSxF-)

As I have bias towards him, would love to read why his detractors feel that way.

That being said, aren't all of India's politicians solo leaders who brook ZERO intra party dissension? At least Modi had to fight his own party to stake the claim of first among equals, whereas people like a Sonia, Rahul or Jaya or Mulayam are uncontested leaders of their parties.

Take the rise of Sonia, she quelled all dissent, ruthlessly shut down eminent people like Narashima Rao, chose to operate the PM via remote control, thereby denigrating the role of the PM as the head of state who constitutionally has only the President above him, has her ""eyes & ears"" in all aspects of governance, who has despite holding all the reins of power been a reculse and has given maybe 2,3 interviews at best in 10 years. Whose son has the gumption to tear up a Cabinet ordinance and proclaim it as nonsense...how is any of this not fascist or dictatorial?

We need not even go down to the regional parties where people like Mulayam, Maya or Jaya lord it up like kings & queens.

Modi on the other hand, has had to fight his claim to be CM of Guj, has had to fight his way to be the face of the BJP, he still has his powerful detractors within the BJP. He has despite his detractors saying otherwise, given many many interviews over the past 10 odd years, and who has no family that will follow his footsteps as though it is some divine right.

I truly would like to understand why he is feared as being a potential despot.",NotaManMohanSingh," The truth of the matter seems to be that many people cannot get over 2002 and the BJP's communal reputation. However that is seen as a tired, redundant argument today so they instead attack the BJP on everything else that other parties and leaders are usually given a pass on.

That is the impression I have gotten. The Congress is run by a single family and most of the regional parties are run by 1-2 prominent leaders, yet it is only Modi's dictatorial style that is focused on by critics. Most parties in UP had some involvement in Muzzafarnagar riots but the BJP is singled out. And so on. Which of the accusation made on Modi,let alone being a dictator is logical? They (haters) want to belittle him one way or other by calling him divisive,polariser,fundamentalist and whatnot.As if their opinions matter to him. He is the only one who has said that he want to be the Prime Minister.",Reddiquette,2014-04-24 20:43:57

The only way is upward now. I m feeling miserable I've been waiting around to literally ""announce"" it for people to hear me out, so here it goes;

**I've FINALLY graduated!**

Taking hold of the Provisional Certificate & the Transfer-cum-Migration Certificate was probable one of the happiest moment of life till now. It took me six and half years coupled with 13 backlogs but I endured, I did it. Saying almost brings tears to my eyes but regardless I did it. Looking back at it now, I only realize the lessons I picked up on the way and the way they've changed my outlook towards life.

Anyway, I've been worried a bit about being unemployed due to my fucked up academics and the missteps but I think I'll need a short break. I'm going over to my cousin's place in a couple of days, can't wait to meet my niece and then head home after 2 long years!

So if you're reading this line then I assume you probably have read the whole thing. If you did thank you for hearing me out. It's embarrassing and TBH I doubt if there's anyone interested in listening to me nag about something that doesn't bother him/her. 

Lastly, if you're depressed and feel shitty about yourself, all I can say is to hold on man, it'll pass, it's just a matter of time.

And for those of you having a hard time at college, agreed college and academics can be quite stressful and depressing at times. There are times when you mess up royally even when you're not at fault, if that's your case, I hope you make it through the other end. Don't give up, it's just a phase, make it through and you will be a completely different person towards the end of it. You will be proud of your achievement and will not shy away from giving yourself a pat.

Good luck. Father : Kya kar raha hai aj kal
Mother : Kya kar raha hai aj kal
Brother : Kya karra hai aj kal
Friends : Kya karra hai aj kal
Relatives : Kya Karra hai aj kal
Strangers : Tum karte kya ho

Even if I do something small like taking a water bottle to the movies when it was not allowed to, it makes me nervous and it feels like I am about to puke. So, please bear this post of mine. It's me being a little mischievous in the internet. How do you know if something is wrong with yourself? Psychologist?

I try to study but eventually the thoughts of having my life wasted overwhelm me. I want this to end. I want to be happy again. I was alaways the adarsh guy alaways listened to parents, never smoked, drank but still this happens to me.. All of that is an illusion.
God help me. I think the scary part of being in a poor mental state is not being able to pinpoint the root cause. Of course, there are multiple points in life which add up to the situation we are in, but to find out that one particular incident which initiated the snowball effect - very tough. Need to see a phycologist or psychiatrist.. can't deal with all this alone.. any recommendations? Am in Delhi.. Frequent comparison with others is probably the cause of all the depression nowadays. It is getting harder to fix the comparison behavior because media and social media are thriving only because of that characteristic of human beings My mood is shifting from life of party to i want to push every one away with a voice you need to .......

I'm at a loss for words. I don't know what to do. It's taking a toll on my mental health.  Felt like sharing this with someone. There comes a day once in a while I think of ending this life but couldn't do it when in very last moment I begin to ponder that my mother couldn't bear my death and probably die. I have to put a strong fight with myself each time on that particular day. This country is just plain bullshit. I'm outraged at the fact that something like the Unnao rape & murder happens in our country. I'm saddened that the bureaucracy and politia support it indirectly. 

I'm sad that our leaders don't give a fuck abt this news, and yet they're gonna appear on Man vs Wild series. 

I'm sad that doctors, once the equivalent of gods and for thr right reasons too, are soft targets for the general public now.

Trees are being cut down. Floods happening almost everywhere. I guess tropical countries like ours are gonna be the worst hit by climate changes. early 30s. lost job a year+ ago. large layoff at employer.  

was super pissed off at the timing, coz major personal stuff got screwed thanks to me not handling this layoff situation properly.  
  
&nbsp;  

was angry + needed a break , and financially was not urgent to get a next job asap.  
so didn't search for jobs immediately.   
  
&nbsp;  
didn't have the balls to go around traveling, road tripping, chilling, etc.   
became idle. wasting time online.  and totally lifeless.   
met psychiatrist. prescribed meds. that helped.  
Dr said ""get a job asap. else it'll be bad again. meds can't help infinitely"".  
the Dr is a bit blunt. doesn't talk much.    
  
&nbsp;  

however, not yet begun to job search.  
not even updated linkedin profile  nor made CV.    

have big fear of facing interview.   was at previous job for 9yrs.   
fear of interview, fear of failure. haven't even tried.   :(       

&nbsp;  

strange & bad: i am not even thinking of this situation, nor thinking of anything else.   
mind is just blanked out.  mindlessly sitting on reddit, netflix, news sites, etc.   

&nbsp;  

parents are super pissed off. almost everyday phone calls are getting very blunt, harsh. certainly not depending on them for money, coz I have savings. yet, their concern is their concern.  don't want to go deeper into that part.     
&nbsp;  

I do not like this version of myself.  
I want to be back being productive again.   
it's been a 10-12L loss of income. that is HUGE for me. i don't dwell on that. but I want to stop that losses asap now.   
i want to see money coming to my account every month.  
  
&nbsp;  


need to restart my life: prepare CV, update linkedin, post on job sites,contact people, face interviews , keep aside fear of failure, etc.   

**and** thinking of this , i get another fear ""how do I explain the massive gap in employment?""

any advice / suggestions /help shall be super helpful. [deleted] I feel like I am on the verge of a mental breakdown. I am 31 years old and work in a digital advertising. My current workplace is full of young kids with the average between 25-27. I was initially happy to switch here as I was stuck in a dead-end job in a company where nobody valued me but looking at these kids makes me realise how much time I have wasted my life to end.

I also started taking my marriage discussions seriously with my parents after which things got worse. My salary and my age are just too shameful when other people with their engineering degrees are earning easily in lakhs or are settled abroad.

This sent me further down the memory lane to my school days on how I could've ended up as an engineer but got carried away to end up getting 43% in my XII and then settling for BMM. Maybe, had I flunked the test, it would've been better.

After mustering up some zeal, I have taken up to study coding on my own and see if I can use to further my career or change streams but I know time is not on my side and without an engineering degree or experience, I will never match up to others. I feel all the doors in my life are now closed and I am just going where the stream takes me, hopeless and directionless :( :'( I had been feeling pretty depressed over the past couple of weeks and   things had been getting better, but I had a panic attack on [friday night](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cicr3n/random_daily_discussion_thread_july_27_2019_at/ev4pd50/). It was long and intense and I did manage to calm down and go to sleep eventually. Was feeling pretty fatigued yesterday but looks alright now.  
  
I'm convinced and motivated to get some professional help. Who should I look for? A psychologist or a psychiatrist?  Any reccos for Bangalore? (preferably north/east bangalore) @mods: Great weekly initiative. May I suggest adding this list of crowdsourced therapists to the weekly post or as a pinned response to the weekly thread. Was compiled by folks all over the Indian internet and might be useful for someone seeking professional help. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pzckT6ns2H1IlmwYwJa8EnBh_1u3gRA9cEOoA4zfilc/edit?usp=drivesdk I feel bad looking at the rape cases and killings. And police cooperates with the person who has more money.

This makes me sad, recently there has been a lot of similar news in this sub.

I sometimes also read news articles that shows complete stupid investigation and police don't know about technology and all.

I feel bad about it.

I recently read a article : https://www.newkerala.com/news/read/183352/pune-bodies-of-mother-her-3-children-found-hanging-in-house.html

There are many problems like, why will someone call police to break the door? And so on. I hate putting in effort to improve myself. [deleted] 28 M, Engineering Grad. I'm in a situation that isn't the worst but its driving me mad. Working a job ion the startup ecosystem that doesn't really make use of my brain all that much. It also happens to be a generalist role which makes it harder for me to go into a specialised role. Money is just survival amounts. 

I know I shouldn't compare myself to others my age but I can't help it when its staring me in the face. I want to start my own business because I know I'm good at it(have started one before) and obviously I don't like my earnings capped by what my employer pays me. Problem is, I don't know what kind of business to start. I have decent land resources courtesy family and might be able to put up a small amount to start-up. 

All of these frustrations have been playing on loop and I am considering quitting my job and taking a month off to travel, get some space and clear my head. The question is, what awaits me when I get back? Will I find another job? Will I gain any clarity? All of these questions are giving me anxiety.

You might have 1-2 friends whom you talk once in a while. I am not even talking about close friends.

I am talking about just casual friends. Is there anyone? I have zero casual (or close) friends Money makes many things and one thing for sure is hatred between relatives! This thread is just in time for what I had on my mind the whole day. 

**How do you deal with the reality of your parents getting older?**

Yesterday evening I saw my father come back home and just wind down as he usually does. And for the first time, seeing him made me feel this dread in the air... He's growing old... No... He IS old. I could see the toll time has taken on him. Wish I had better words to describe my thoughts. 

Now I know this didn't happen overnight and yesterday wasn't any different than any other day in past few months/years. But I felt this helpless fear seeing this man who carried the weight of a family so well for decades, now labouring to push through another day. 

Folks, how do/did you deal with this? Is there anyone belonging to no-hugs family here? i.e. one where no one ever hugs someone else in the family. I wish my folks just got divorced. I know, life would have been very different (maybe worse) if that happened, but at least I wouldn't be so socially fucked up as a grown adult. From age 10, all I can remember is my parents not even talking to each other. My dad is a piece of shit, fine. My mom struggled a lot to give me and my brother a better life, which I really appreciate. But honestly, in retrospect, I feel a divorce would have been better than all of us just living in one house like a bunch of roommates who just talk to each other about things like dinner is ready, should I switch off the lights, etc.

Even today, I cannot understand how a normal family functions. I mean, I cannot process it. When my friends say they are just going to the park with their parents or going on a holiday with their family, I cannot understand it. I cannot process a bunch of people in a family sitting around a table and just talking about their day and shit.

If I ever have kids, I am going to make sure they don't suffer as I did. Seriously. Would-be parents who are reading this, if you start hating each other, just get a divorce and move on. It has lasting effects on the child. How many of you have lost perfectly normal loving uncles , aunts , parents , cousins due to radicalisation by hate messages , fake news on WhatsApp , Shit news ? 

How do you handle them ? How to handle family occasion ? Is there a hope ? Your thoughts on arranged marriages? I dread the prospect of marrying a stranger, someone whom I'll never be able to love. I am a 34 year old man and all of a sudden missing friendship with my guy friends. All my friends have gotten married, moved abroad or just decided not to be my friend for religious reasons. I do not have a guy friend who I can talk to one on one or just ask out for a movie or a drink. 

I am still in touch with my female friends and speak to them once in a while but when it comes to guys, I don't have anyone in India I could call a friend. [deleted] any stories of overprotective/helicopter parents?  

Hi all, Did not think my first post in 8 years will be for relationship support. I will try to keep it as short as possible. 

  
I  am 29 year old male who joined a bank 2 yrs ago after completing MBA.  When i joined my father had passed away just 3 months back and i being  the eldest sibling wanted to marry and settle down as soon as possible  to  take over responsibilities of my family. Among other people another  girl aged 25 right now also joined with me at Delhi location. I liked  her from the beginning and after being friends with her and pursuing  relationship with her for 2-4 months, she finally said yes to me in last  may. Although she said yes i always felt that she was not really sure  about me(she sometimes also said it outright) and i thought with time  she will like me more and this feeling will go away.

  
In  Sep last year, she moved to Hyderabad to work for an FMCG company and  we decided to try long distance. Till Jan this everything was okay. I  would visit her and then she visited me as well. We sometimes had fights  over communication problems but then would talk sense into each other  and moved forward. Jan was the last time i visited her. Once i got back i  got stressed out due to multiple family problems which i wont get into  and in addition that nagging feeling that she was not really sure, i  decided to end it and called her. We discussed it a lot and then decided  to end our relationship in Feb end... As soon as i did it, i realized i  made a mistake but i didnot call her back because i was the one  proposed to end it but lo and behold after 20 days she says she is in  delhi and wants to meet me... We met and decided to give it one more  try. 

  
Now from March to May end we had good moments  and bad moments but according to me these were normal communication  issues of long distance...i told her to come to Hyderabad but she would  make excuses and all. On May 28 i called her and she was not showing a  lot of interest for last 3-4 days, so i told her to call when she wanted  to talk and hung up. 15 days passed and no call. Ultimately i called  her and asked she was behaving like we were done with each other and she  said yes we are done and hung up...it was so shocking that i got so  angry that i also decided to end it...however after 15 more days i  called her and told her if we are going to end it, we should end it on a  good note and wished her best of luck for her future and she did the  same.  
At this point of  time, it was july 1 and i thought we were not made for each other. But i  started missing her a lot and atlast messaged her on july 20 that i  wanted to meet to discuss and wanted to get back together. She remained  very adamant she had 0 interest in me now, had moved on and i should  also do so. But i kept poking her and atlast she told me that she had  gone on trip with her MBA friends in Jan this year and had started  developing feeling for another guy who was in 2017 batch of her MBA  college. She tried to supress those feelings and tried to be with me but  couldn't do so and when we stopped talking on may 28, decided that we  were done and now wanted to move forward. This guy from her college is  in same company in chandigarh, earns better, has good career prospects  than me and they ofcourse have more common friends.  
Now  i did some more digging and found that she had come to delhi to go to  mcloedganj with this guy on may 31 without telling me...just 3 days  after she stopped talking to me... ofcourse they would have planned it  while while she was all lovey dovey with me( she says they went in a  group although i dont trust her since there were no pics on any social  media). I confronted her and now she has blocked me on fb, insta,  whatsapp everywhere. Also all this confrontation happened only on  messaged and she never picked my call and refused to meet me.  
2.5  years have passed since i joined my company...my career is going  nowhere...i sidelined my family responsibilities for her....i am now a  grey haired balding fat slob who still has strong feelings for a girl  and still wants to be with her after getting cheated on. All my friends  say i should have seen it coming or i should have committed more time to  her. Cherry on the cake was she asked to tell about us to noone...so  none of our common friends knew about us till last week ....and now she is telling  everyone that she always told me that she was not sure about me and  tried with me but it did not work out  
I dont really know where to go from here. I miss her and still pathetically in love with her r/IndianRelationships is a good place for this. [deleted]",Reddiquette,2019-07-29 00:09:45

I lived in a hostel till I was 12 so I never really got to spend much time with my dad. I haven't talked to him for the last 6 years. A lot of people say that they don't feel anything bad about not having a father. That their mom is their father and mother at the same time. I love my mom. There can be no doubt about that. I'm.also aware of how my much she loves me and all the sacrifices she has made for me.

But still I miss my dad. Or I should say a father figure. I can't say this to my mom because she is really sensitive and can start crying over literally anything.

Last Wednesday I went to one of my mom's friends home. Her son is 5 years old. When his father came back home (he is a doctor) he started playing with him. It kind of hurt so bad seeing them, remembering that I never got to play with my dad when I was 5, or in any age. My parents are forcing me to leave my job and get married. Why do parents behave like this.  
All my life, they told me to work hard and aim to achieve great things. But now since I am 24 they want me forget all about that and get married. 
They even had the audacity to tell me they made a mistake letting me study. I am really disappointed in them. I always thought my parents were better than that. So tomorrow is my Mom's birthday and my ""father"" already gave her a birthday present two days ago. 

He said he wishes her birthday becomes her deathday and it would be nice if she gets her head cut off in a train track. 

This is one the worst thing he has ever done and that includes him trying to murder her 2 years ago with a scissor.  

Hopefully by end of next year i can get my chamber running well enough so that i can get a loan for half the money i need for me and mom's new flat [she will pay the other half directly].

Problem is, the motherfucker is pretty well politically connected to the ruling party [was a big student leader and is a big enough name in his academic line]. My question is pretty common. How to move on? 
I dated a 4 years girl ago and it lasted for 2 years. It was a long distance relationship. She was unhappy so she wanted to brake up due to constant fights. I also thought it was better to leave her back then but after a month of breakup I started feeling miserable. This continued till a year. Even after 2.5 years of breakup I still miss her. But let's leave that part.

Now coming to main point, due to my miserable life after breakup I many times decided to never to talk to her. Initially in the first year after breakup, she messaged me rarely but after that the frequency increased and now it's like every 3 days. I tried telling her many times, that her messaging me is not healthy for me, I don't feel mentally stable because the thought of her causes intense mood swings in me. But she replies each time that she just wants to be my friend and help me through this phase. 

I even shouted and screamed at her multiple times, just to tell her to stay away from me and not contact me due to my mental issues. I tried blocking her many times, deleted her number but she reaches me anyway and since I always has a soft spot for her, I unblocked her every time and had to talk to her.

She just asks general questions- how are you, how's college going etc. It's not like she manipulates me, she just doesn't understand that we cannot be friends because I will always have feelings for her but she would never. What should I do? 

Also She is dating her 1st bf again (I was her 2nd) and the thought of it also makes me mad. [deleted] I am 28 (male) and my mother died(suicide) when I was 8 moths old. My father remarried with my aunt's sister. I stayed with my maternal grand parents(nana-nani) till 17. I came back to my father and started living with him. It's been 11 years since then only he cares about money. 2 years back I stopped giving him money, He told me to live separately and Now I live in a different state. He never calls or ask how I am. I recently visited him on a festival and he just again did the same thing, talked with me in anger and said me to never go to him and he will give everything to his daughters. I was only child from my mothers and I have three step sisters from this mom. and This mom is a villainous woman for me. I don't know what should I do? I will net get married as Indian society looks for groom's background and family, and my family has abandoned me I'm in a really sticky situation. 
***
I'm 20M and currently an Engineering student. I'm in a sordid state of affairs because of my strict parents. As surprising it might be, I've zero social life(my daily routine consists of going from Home to College),and even in that process I need to inform my parents about my whereabouts. Any delay in informing,and they'll ring up my Profs,my HoD & my friends!

No partying with friends,no dine-outs and a strict curfew time(as if I've ventured out someday!).

Compounding this situation,is that... I'm in a relationship. Because of my parents,even taking my girlfriend out on a date becomes stressful for me, I've to create alibis for myself.

Couple of months ago, they guessed I was in a relationship,and I had to spill the beans. As expected,they turned from ""liberal"" parents to completely Super Saiyan mode, telling me to break-off the relationship with this 'random girl'. Of course, I didn't.

Now,even talking to her on phone gets tough,because my mother is forever snooping. Earlier,my grades weren't really good,but I'm getting better now. Yet they blame the relationship and the subsequent lack of grades,lack of good behaviour,lack of respect for them,lack of familial values.

While I see my friends partying,getting on get-togethers,taking their gals on a date, I'm not even able to convince my parents for a movie with my friends (they suspect, there'll be girls- susheel Sanskari beta bigad jayega )

Even my expenses are limited,spend more than 100/- per week on anything other than conveyance,and they'll say-""stop taking random girls on dates, they'll yield nothing.""

I'm tired and I'm sick of fighting this battle in my head. Sometimes,me and my girlfriend fight due to these issues(her family is quite liberal,tho) and then, I feel like an absolute piece of ... you know what.

Yesterday,my Mom caught me talking with her and raised an issue. She said that we're persuing a ""faltu""(worthless) relationship. My girlfriend heard it and was furious. I can understand it,anyone will be. Her ego and honour was hurt. 

She was aghast that I didn't do much, except for giving my Mom the silent treatment. We're nearly on the verge of breakup as she says,her emotional needs aren't met. Yet, I don't want to break up with her. I just can't.

Now, I'm living off my Dad's money,and I can't even rebel and stand up for myself.

Any advice?

TL;DR: 20M, Parents controlling every aspect of my life. Feeling messed up from within.

Edit1: Thanks everybody for your advice. it really matters to me a lot. Relationship advice

Hi I am 23 year old Mechanical engineer working in software MNC. All my life I never have been in relationships. I would be lying if I say I am not craving for relationship, sex and other stuff.

Recently, I started dating a girl. I really like her. But after some free lunches, she has started behaving weird. She said she could not be in relationship with me coz of her parents. She says she loves me but she can't be with me. Over a period of time she has become dry, absolute dry. No emotions at all.
I am still pursuing her. Part of me thinks that I really love her and other part of thinks that I only want physical relationship from her and that's why I want to be with her. 

What should I do now?

P.S.- sorry for any grammatical mistakes Using a throwaway for this.

I (35M) was in a relationship with this girl about 2.5 years ago. I loved her with all my heart. Like she was the one and all that jazz.

&#x200B;

She claimed that her ex was abusive and used to beat her and force himself on her, and that she broke it off with him just before she her marriage. They had been together for 7 years before she met me. Listening to that made my blood boil, but I didn't care. She was with me and I would never do anything to hurt her.

&#x200B;

About 3-4 months before she broke up with me, her ex started calling her continuously, and in spite of me requesting her to block him, she continued talking to him. She would always compare me to him, and keep reminiscing about the time when she was with him. It hurt like sin listening to it, but I loved her and I never said a word.

&#x200B;

Eventually, she broke up with me to be with him. I sent that bastard a ""congratulations"" text, telling him about how she had broken up with me.

&#x200B;

He dumped her.

&#x200B;

She blamed me for him dumping her. Railed on me about how I wasn't a man. That he was the love of her life, and how I destroyed her life.

&#x200B;

It's been 2.5 years now. I still don't have the confidence to commit to anyone. Whenever any girl I start talking to on dating apps starts getting close to me, I push them away by acting like a jerk or ghosting them.

&#x200B;

I really want to hold someone close to me, to feel the warmth of her skin close to mine. But I can't. I'm a Software Engineer living in Bangalore, originally from a tier 3 City of Gujarat.

  


**Sometimes** I badly miss my family (3 kids (niece, nephew) + mummy mainly). **Not always.** I **loved** livingBangalore most of the time (Nice city, people, places, culture, etc).

  


I'm a little confused professionally. I want at least one big known software company on my resume.

  


I want to know other people's opinion on what are benefits and disadvantage of

1. Getting a job in a big known software company and living in Bangalore.

2. Getting a remote job and living back to my native place. My family forced me to go for MS of all places - australia and leave my job in Bangalore. I am not at all comfortable with the decision and not very comfortable living in a new place. Dear counselors,

I need advice on a case of acquitenance. 

One of my cousin brother committed Suicide due to the mental torture from  wife.

He was married from past 4 years and had 2-3 year old baby boy.

His wife was staying with their own parents most of the time.

These two brothers were married to two real sisters and another sister is also having same issue and having a baby boy and she had given full support to her younger sister in this whole case.

Could you please suggest me what can we do here. Both legally and logically.

I'm just thinking aloud here if this girl did this, entire family of this boy would have been put in jail and their life would have been hell.

Thanks. Thank you folks for this. I tried to post about my problems in the relationship_advice and stopped after realizing that it will take a hell lot of time to explain the Indian family structure before I could actually ask something. My date didn't yet to talk me about second date. What to do? Should I call her? i don't know if it's off the topic but any group online where inter-religion couples can exchange views",Reddiquette,2019-07-21 14:26:22

Looks like the next elections will deliver a Congress mukt bharat. Wasn't the social media manager of Congress going to do 1 more ama after the results? Things opposition has to improve :

1. They need to get rid of nepotism, at least at the top. Most of parties in MGB are dynastic and have history of corruption. Do away with old guard and bring in some fresh blood and ideas. To do that these parties will have to adopt an internal constitution and processes to ensure rise of meritorious candidates. Currently, it seems impossible. 

 

2. Embrace true secularism i.e. stop pandering to a community for votebank. Support secular Uniform civil code and be adamant at separation of governance and religion.  

 

3. Do good work at the states where they are in power. Stop fighting elections on the failures of Modi, fight elections on your merits. 
 


4. Opposition also needs to identify the rotten apples and distance itself from them. Mamata has shown dictatorial tendencies and her party is famed for its use of violence. No need to establish ties with her. She will bring you down with her. Enemy of enemy is my friend doesn't apply in politics. Aligning with someone who has contrasting vision and aspirations sends mixed signals to the voter. 


5. Have a vision paper based on development, progress, true secularism, equality , national security and climate. Fighting elections purely on caste equations and quota promises will only get this far. Room for Caste politics is diminishing and in next 20 years, may start to become irrelevant. 


I can see opposition embracing 3 and 4, but not 1 and 2, therefore the opposition loses might keep on piling.


Edit : Added point 5


Edit 2: I voted for BJP because to me the alternative was a coalition of dynastic regional parties with history of corruption such as RJD, SP, BSP, DMK, CBN's party, TMC and that would have been catastrophic for our nation. 

If political parties implement the amendments that I have stated, then we have an excellent opportunity to elevate the political discourse and improve the governance. I don't favour any party. But this is bad for India, not because BJP got elected. But because there is a non-existent opposition party. Too much power at one party didn't always bode well for India.

Well, fuck. I believe Congress, SP, BSP etc all need fresh faces at the top. Rahul and Akhilesh bhaiyya are memes. Notice how the final results are yet to be formally declared - as of 12pm , 24th May. This is because of verifying of VVPAT slips from 5 random EVMs from each constituency. No reports of any discrepancy yet. I hope this ends the EVM discussion. Why BJP Won:   
(Numbers from BJP President's press conference)

\- 3 Years of preparation (From January 2016)  
\- 3000 full time on ground workers focusing on Lok Sabha & Vidhan Sabha constituencies for the last two years  
\- 18 National level committees headed by senior ministers  
\- 29 State level committees involving 435 senior leaders.  
\- 482 Constituency level committees having 7,230 karyakartas in positions of responsibility  
\- 11 crore registered karyakartas (expanded from 2.5 crores in 2014)  
\- 161 Call Centers providing backup support for the last 6 months to karyakartas engaged in a campaign to reach 24 crores 81 lakh people

Ideology is important.   
Social media reach is important.   
Arguments and rants are important.   
But nothing can substitute the impact of pure hard work done meticulously. I have a question. Why do people of Punjab vote for Congress and not BJP unlike other North Indian states? One thing is clear from the comments in this post: quite a few people misinterpret democracy as ""whatever I think good"" and intelligence as ""agreeing with me"". Daenerys Targaryens are abundant. I dont wana jump anybody. Just curious.

Rajasthan has ruling party Congress, still how did they not win even one seat?? This is the best result that could have happened. UPA sucks real bad, plus they don't bring anything to the table. Voting for UPA  just means voting for one family with only a vision to get re elected, nothing for the nation. The congress should ditch the Gandhis if it wants to have any future. My generation has no place in our hearts for them quite simply.  

As for a strong opposition,  AAP made that space, credible with decent faces and leaders. If Kejriwal had not made stopping the BJP his only agenda and concentrated on expanding only his party, probably made a 20 year roadmap, We could have a good left face to BJPs right. A two party system which would have the complete range of ideological offerings. Non-Indian leftist here, I heard from a friend that a big part of Modi's win was his successful electrification/running water projects in poorer areas, which made up for the weaker macroeconomic factors. How much truth is there to this? I am kind of surprised that why some people (read opposition) was not able to gauge the scale of the expected win.I mean Modi may not be an autocrat but he seems to get some shit done. Ujjwala Yojna ,Mudra Yojna and PM-KISAN were delivered to people in much more efficient way than the past precedence. In India, people want to give second chance to the one who seems to do things. [removed] [**Not more than 250 for NDA, was my secret wish: Jagan**](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/not-more-than-250-for-nda-was-my-secret-wish-jagan-736218.html)

Lol. I like that he's so open about it. I suspect there were several other regional leaders that were hoping for a similar outcome for an entry into the NDA. KCR, Naveen Patnaik, maybe even MK Stalin and Mayawati.  PM-Kisan for farmers and Ujjwala scheme  were two main schemes which created a strong under current for BJP even in those states which the party recently lost and also Ayushman bharat is also popular among lower income group people ,Modi not only able to kick off these schemes but also able to take them to people directly  like in our house maid was happy and in village women were happy by getting gas cylinders instead of daily cow-dung cakes process.Same goes with PM-Kisan farmers received their 1st installment directly in their accounts before elections. This is what happens when you have no credible opposition and a bunch of corrupt to the core and greedy regional parties. Hoping for Piyush Goyal as Finance Minister Congress gained at the expense of non-aligned forces. So, the *mahagathbandhan* was a massive failure. NDA has one seat less as compared to 2014. BJP won 303 seats this time. What was their tally in 2014? Was it 336 or 352 in 2014 ? I think Ayushman Bharat pushed a lot of votes in Tier-II and Tier-III cities towards BJP. Any opinions ? Only person who could have taken on Modi was probably Amarinder Singh. 

You want to use nationalism? Well, Amarinder served in the armed forces. 

You want use the Sikh killings? Amarinder is a sikh. 

You want to use Modi's experience? Well, Amarinder is a CM of a border state. 

But ofcourse, the Gandhis would rather keep power to themselves than do something good for the party. According to India Today - Axis:

&#x200B;

The most important issue for people when deciding who to vote for was 

&#x200B;

Unemployment (33%)

&#x200B;

National Security was at 9%. 

&#x200B;

I think this is should be a clear message to to INC that people just don't see Rahul Gandhi as a capable leader who can solve India's problems. [removed] BTW it looks like the NDA will finally get a majority in the Rajya Sabha by 2020.

Aside from overblown fears about Emergency and changing the Constitution, it'll enable them to pass long-stalled bills like the Land Acquisition Reforms and Triple Talaq Bill. If you consider politicians as entrepreneurs like I do , we can see that BJP is a party (organisation) of first generation entrepreneurs who got their big break (funding) during the Emergency or the Ram Mandir movement. 

While the opposition seems like a tepid slow organisation of third , fourth or in case of the congress, fifth generation entrepreneurs. This manifests in the energy levels we see in the two organisations. While one is all about hustling and getting things done (some of which may be wrong), the second is plagued with unnecessary overhead costs that have no marginal utility whatsoever. 

Either the promoters step back and let a professional handle the organisation or this will not end up well for them. Lastly , this is a new India. We do not dream about government jobs. We dream about startups. We dream about doing things (which may be wrong ). We sure as hell hate the status quo. So regional parties lost the most?

I've always felt we need more diversity in the Parliament, but it seems that thats not what the most of the country feels.

I think the politics of appealing to the weakest and the backward is over. Maybe we've really moved on from being a primarily poor country and moving towards being a middle income country. In which case politicians will need to change their tactics.


In this regard, Modi is the only one speaking to people's aspirations. Everyone else is still stuck at hand outs and government programs. I guess that isnt enough anymore. And its as if RG and all the other party heads have missed the memo.


TLDR: BijliSadakPani is not enough anymore Sambit Patra lost or Won. Can't trust the media these days. Riding the ""Me first"" wagon they have stopped verifying sources.

Edit:

He Lost. Imagine instead of working on policies Sambit Patra shouting in Parliament ""Mandir Yahi Banega"" [removed] Modi won election massively not just because of his work and performance but also because of the failure of Congress and especially Rahul Gandhi .hopefully they stop blaming the EVM and find out the real reason behind their biggest defeat and serve the country. This might be the time for BJP to start delivering their worth. The nation has shown trust, and its not something complicated that is needed, although it is hard. 

This election also shows a massive gap in the absence of a reasonable 3rd front. I hope the next election gives us some semblance of it at a national level, that people who connect can hopefully get behind. For eg, TN has no clue what they're doing. It all points to the fact that we don't have a good 3rd alternative. 

Democracy wins only when there is a ruling party and a non-senile opposition party working towards development with a north-star focus. Approach might be different, but things will be thought through. 

I'm not discounting what BJP is capable of doing, but their momentum is very high now. An influential opposition will ensure they don't derail. We can't say the same now. Rahul must resign Any ideas on how many for NOTA? AAP who? ...I’d say with finality that this is the end of “Muslim appeasement” in India.

If those of you that maybe have a better clue than myself could please chime in on what this means for Islamic populations in India and whether there would be a more dramatic mass emigration of these populations to more Islam-friendly countries? [deleted] What I disliked the most was the opposition leaders claiming voter fraud when exit polls showed things look grim for them. Just be gracious and don't let the efforts of EC, the security forces and thousands of people who worked to keep this election free and fair be clouded like this. Our EC gives training and seminars around the world to newer democracies on how to conduct elections. They must be doing something right The bad thing in all this is the opposition does not know how to oppose. Congress, Tmc,Sp-Bsp are people who have been in power for quite a while.(That is also a problem with modi). But the difference here is we see is the process in which was able to acquire such leadership is through hardwork. Do not get me wrong,the guy is shrewd and conniving and will do anything to crush. The unique factor is that he knows it is not his job to crush. It is ours. We have the ability to take power out. He knows that and now it is proven that having money and connections dont matter. Other parties lost because of one thing,they continuously forgot about our power. BJP has fault in many way and right now in my opinion the majority voted for BJP is because of modi and his potential. The way the centre has been working now is astounding. Due to the 2014 election I wished to become an ias officer. 
And one more thing you should understand. People are not stupid anymore. Lok sabha is a different beast and assembly is a different beast. I live in Maharashtra and I a way I can imagine Maharashtrans not voting for BJP. What people are scared about now is the uncertainty. BJP knew they will win but not by this margin. This chat reminded me why I came on reddit. To stay away from Indian keyboard warriors. Thanks for reminding me :) Fucking delhi people. Atishi worked so hard for them and they voted for some cricketer(50%+). I dont care if this wasn't state election. 

I hope AAP loses in next election and they shut down AAP. These people don't deserve true politicians. Its not worth fighting for such people at all. Let them have actors and cricketers. How is NDA -1 I thought they did better than before? The land of self-respect movement, Tamil Nadu, sends two Ambedkarites, four communists (one of whom is a Sahitya Academy award winning writer), and three women writers to the parliament. Left politics should have been almost decimated with just one member in the parliament, but Stalin saves Marx in TN and sends four communists to the parliament. Can anyone give an insight into why TDP lost in Andhra Pradesh? [This](https://imgur.com/a/TugSAjS) is the Official Assembly wise result tabulation for Moradabad Lok Sabha Constituency. NRC had a significant role in propelling NDA in Assam. Opinions ? Would've been good for the nation if Congress didn't lose by such a large margin. I was expecting a 40% majority votes for Congress and 60% for BJP. This crushing defeat is bad. A party shouldn't have this much power. It'll only raise their arrogance to the peaks. That little fear of 'people might not vote for me next time if I don't try to do be a good leader' is what kept them in check. I think congress is dead. Like this year they hunt people to stand for Election and next election there will br free seat to contest under their party banner. Really what break trust at exterme level rather than courrption for an    Indian people Just want to ask a question. Modi took advantage of polarization. That's definitely one of the major reasons behind his landslide victory ( apart from presence of an worthy opponent etc). But polarization means presence of at least two poles. Who created these poles? Modi? Or were these poles always present in the common mind and Modi just added fuel to it? If it was present before, who actually created this pole? And accepted Hindutva is one of these poles, but from where the other pole is coming? As far as I know, Modi is promoting (or taking advantage of) the Hindutva pole, but from where this other pole is getting formed (or has already formed)? I can't speak for everyone in TN but the folks i know in my area of TN (Trichy) voted against BJP because of increase in communal tensions and demonetization, all the BJP supporters i know in TN are upper class brahmins This election is a watershed moment in Indian history. Welcome to the New India™. Just to put this into perspective, this win makes Modi a democratically elected leader voted in by almost a half a billion people; a genuine and credible mandate. Let that sink in for the moment. Just from the backing perspective, he is bigger than Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Akbar, Prithviraj Chauhan or any other historical figure in Indian history. India has not seen such a leader.

For good or bad, India is going to change dramatically over the next few decades. It will be a far cry from the India that we grew up in, part Socialist part Capitalistic, looking for an identity, a place in the world. Our children will grow up in a completely different India which is for all intents and purposes already a Hindu Rashtra. No constitution change is needed. As Modi pointed it out in his speech yesterday, secularism is now a dirty word and no politician can use (or abuse) it anymore.  

Bit by bit, Modi will consolidate power, just as Xi, Putin, Ergodan and all other authoritarians before him. With no credible opposition, he will do everything to keep himself in power, including destroying the very institution which brought him into power, the RSS. Although I do believe Modi has the right interests at heart and wants the best for India, he's a politician and self-preservation is going to trump national interest in the end. A credible opposition will eventually emerge and will most probably be from within the Sangh Pariwar itself. 

I personally am looking forward to this New India. I think it's going to be exciting. I expect a lot of changes, both good and bad in equal measure which I'm fine with. Just for keepsakes, I have saved today's newspaper. Whichever side of history Modi ends up in, we will look back to this day and recount it to our children and grandchildren.  [removed] Hope opposition asks good questions in parliament. Unchecked power is dangerous! Now that I have had some time to ponder on the result, I think that this government will not drastically change our country even with the majority seats. This will be more or less similar to other 2nd term governments. 

India will not really transform as much as we think it should under Modi's reign. The development will continue in the same rate, the system will be cleansed but in a glacial pace, the saffronisation will also be done relatively slowly. 

India will become a strong country with global importance in the future but it will never become a superpower. Indian people will have more money to spend but we will not be a rich country. 

Modi was right in his speech in a way, there will be no poor people in the country because they will be extinguished. Only a large middle class and a substantial upper class will remain. Because this was a mandate by the money, for the money, of the money.

All in all, India will become a bit more right-leaning country than before but it will still remain India. I will still be spat upon, riding my cycle, from a passing by vehicle. Some of us will be a uncomfortable at first but we will learn to adjust over the years. After all, we are Indians. Personally, I don't think it was a good idea to give so much power to a person like Modi.

But I guess, a significant percent of my countrymen disagree with me..... and I respect their decision.

Lets hope power does not ""corrupt"" him. Wonder why Nota never won smh Congress should abandon their type Communist advisors from JN uni  and socialists and be bold in their economic ideas. Manmohan Singh had good ideas but he was hobbled by the socialists in NAC Can someone find out the data on how many women and non-Hindu candidates were elected as MPs? Or is there a list, official or unofficial, of the winning candidates? Kerala and TN mi amigos! Quick question from an Indian American. How did IUML win the Ramanathapuram election in Tamil Nadu? The district is 70%+ Hindu, so I was surprised to see a pro-Muslim interests party win? Was there just really low turnout for Hindu's, or was there another reason? [deleted] As a South Indian I am concerned about both the polar ends of the political spectrum.

The separatist dravidian movement is reflexively projecting the BJP as a Northern invader. 

The BJP's ham-handed approach has really alienated large sections of these states that are extremely concerned about their linguistic and regional identity. 

Both sides need to moderate their stands. [deleted] [removed] The NDA got 352 in the last election I am waiting for the Pulwama conspiracy theories This sub is swarming with the pro-modi supporters since the election. So many posts are downvoted to oblivion if it is anti-bjp or talking about anything related to the muslims.  Probably my own post is gonna be heavily downvoted because it is related.

&#x200B;

The recent elections are going to make the minorities feel nervous about their future. They might not get killed by the gau rakshaks on the open but they can face more open or subtle discrimination on areas like housing,jobs,education and even government services since the racist supporters are getting a validation this time. It already happened in modi's gujrat, the same can happen in the entire north. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minorities-made-to-live-in-fear-we-must-end-this-pm-to-party/articleshow/69500818.cms Am a Tamil guy who spent first 18 years of his life in Delhi and now 8 years and counting in Chennai. Was never really a guy who would take a side when everyone around me would fight about north India vs South India. Always thought all are equal Indians and this is just a silly childish fight. 
And Delhi being the home where I spent my teenage and adolescence, one day I do wanted to come back and live there. But after seeing the overwhelming majority of such an organisation (don't wanna go into what is wrong with them, save it) yesterday, I am done with the people of North. 2014 was understandable, people wanted change. But after all that happened in 5 years, why would such a majority want them back. I wouldn't be able to live with that mentality. Perhaps TN is the right place.

<Just needed a place to rant. I don't have any political inclinations to any other party as well. All are useless. But the ruling one is worse in more than one humanitarian grounds> can anyone tell when will elections happen on Vellore seat You can't fight a cult of personality with ideas and rhetoric. 

Godi media TV channels successfully brainwashed the electorate that Modi is Mhysa, a savior who ""sacrificed"" everything for ""Bharat Mata"", a ""strong"" leader, a person who works ""18 hours a day"" serving the nation. The ""300 killed in balakot"" bullshit was flashed non stop and was swallowed by the people. Ask anyone and they won't say they voted for BJP, they would say they voted for Modi. They might not even know who their local candidate was.

All the justifications we give like - maybe Jan dhan worked, maybe Ayushman worked - are hollow. Nobody cared about these schemes. BJP had the weakest, emptiest manifesto and no messaging on real issues. People voted for the superhero named Modi. A fictional character carefully crafted with a backstory, unrealistic achievements in his childhood and youth and reinforced with ""a day in the life of"" narratives with questions like mango eating and wallet keeping.

Modi occupies the same space in the psyche of the electorate which a godman or a ""chamatkari baba"" does. 

The southern states patting their backs for not voting for this charlatan shouldn't forget how they too have similarly worshipped leaders like MGR & Jayalalithaa in the past. Modi image building was from the same playbook in fact, creating a larger than life persona. Education has nothing to do with this. This is solely a lack of critical thinking and failure to question the narrative set by the mainstream media which comes from the ""accept what you're told"" mindset Indians are brought up with. The World Leader.......@ModiJi Yogendra Yadav fears that Bengal would become a battlefield for 2021 elections given the results in Lok Sabha.

It looks quite funny when Modi talked of inclusivity yesterday when his entire campaign lacked all those things. His twists and turns are lapped up quite easily and everything he said is forgotten conveniently.

The perpetual campaign machine while has reaped benefits for the party will probably leave our nation in a bad shape. BJP reminds me of the left in bengal. I can see it ruling on hate and this right wing vibe till economic numbers catch up and they fail altogether. If they really had some solution, they would have done something useful and not shitty demonetisation. But all that is fluff. We will see raw wisdom again. We will bitch again. They will use ram mandir and pakistan again in 2023. We will forget kathua and vote back again in 2024. This will continue, till the day, it actually won't. And that day, will be very bad. The sangh, just like CPIM will become a non existent entity, an entity whose ideas would be trashed. Unemployment has reached record numbers at a time when demographic dividend has peaked. It's a sorry state. The right wingers are fapping hire and fire as a solution. But that isn't even close to a solution. Electoral bonds, fudging gdp numbers, the list goes on and on

Every idea has its time. We had record low petrol prices. The BJP govt was a failure. And it will be a failure again. But it will win again. Mark my words. 

Amit shah is the mourinho of that bjp team. He can bring those results by tactics. But even moruinho couldn't save chelsea and manu what the fuck happened to AAP? I mean seriously voting gambhir over atishi, what kind of sickness is prevailing in Delhi? All this time I had heard that AAP had done great work in Delhi, reduced pricing for water, electricity, single window clearances, great school and everything but at the end of the day people still voted for BJP in Delhi instead of AAP.    
 I just can't get my around this fact, I mean motherf***ing delhi, what the hell were you thinking. For a second, I say that Modi is great and has insane schemes launched, but what happened to decentralisation of politics and the very basic idea of democracy. Man, honestly whoever shit people may have voted in other parts of India thinking at least Modi is better, I seriously would like to say to anyone from Delhi, boyyo you had an option to vote for a good candidate and yet you didn't. Man i really can't describe the shitload I want to drop on anyone from Delhi who voted for BJP. Worse is the fact that AAP was 3rd in most of the seats not even a runner up candidate. [removed] One thing that has been very notable over last five years was division of India and it's people on the grounds of religion . And it's been too prominent to go unnoticed. [deleted] [removed] [deleted] [removed] I think a person should cast 2 votes, one which he favors other he doesn't favors. The other one will be considered negative votes, subtract from the total number of votes. A better system? [removed] My predictions for the BJp right now are this:

1) stuff every open or partially available position with supporters. Heads of movie boards, education, military.

2) eradicate and arrest congress leaders where possible.

It’s the best time to switch to the turkey model.

Edit: saying this without elaborating is unfair.

The BJP is regularly going to face the fact that it’s chief economic and governance people are not world class. This means aside from increasing G - government spending, reading R - interest rates, and making laws leaner, they have little options.

This forces them to pull from opinionated and vocal members of society, who are not bureaucrats or economists. They will instead pull from the crop of vocal MBA types with the nest saleable credentials to make lateral entries into the system.

This also means that their government has a natural challenge when it involves unusual economic events. 

This is a political risk when it comes to keeping the voters who voted for Modi’s clean and reformer image, and a risk when it comes to incumbency on the ground which can’t be overcome by identity based incentives.


The BJP knows this, and has to make plans accordingly.

This means a plan beyond modi- which they don’t have yet. 

This also means a plan of best make use of their advantage.

Since they think long term, and learn from the world - this means putting people in positions of patronage and influence who will still remain should there be a turn around in their fortunes. 

Earlier, they didn’t have to worry about this - however this election showed that it is not a congress mukt bharat, and that the anti BJP views are likely to grow stronger.

Either they remove the anti BJP views, which I doubt they care about, or they deal with it. 

This is how they will deal with it, and keep their long term prospects healthy. So, not a single muslim MP from BJP? How many were given tickets? Why was Socrates apprehensive of democracy (5 min):

I just want to work more efficiently and clear more topics. Moved to a new place, few days back. So new roommates, and my crippling social anxiety is keeping me from talking to them freely, just like it has done for the last 8 years because of which I haven't formed a connection with another human being. And I'm incapable of feeling love or connecting with others because I'm so caught up in my own anxiety that I only focus on every little thing I do around others and stress over it and I forget to actually enjoy the conversation. Every little thing like, where am I looking, am I making enough eye contact, am I saying the right things, was the tone of my sentence correct, oh no I stuttered I bet they think I'm weird, etc. stresses me out.

1. Family issues - My father is farmer and we are having debts due. My mom keep fighting with my dad evertime many times a day. Also my father attempted suicide once i can't forget that day. We have yet to build home for getting bride as per our society norms at that moment we have kaccha makan.

2. Career Issues - I am not settled yet anywhere even i am 25. Dropped Diploma polytechnic due to financial situation then cleared 12th. Depressed and having suicidal thoughts sometime after going through such situation from long time. Total hopeless now.
No good friends never been in a relationship there is nothing interesting in life. I have insane amounts of anxiety. Have had it all my life. There is also a major life change coming up soon which has been seriously stressing me out. Have had to stop myself often from having suicidal thoughts. I left my job and went back to my parents as they wanted me to be with them, I thought they'll help with seed money to start my business (i belong to a typical business/baniya family) now it's been two years I'm not able to find a job neither  do i have the seed money. I've lost all my confidence and feel sad all the time. I'm torn between my aspirations and expectations from my parents Finally visited a psychatrist last week. Was having repeated panic attacks and depressive episodes. A little better now and have joined a gym but I still tend to completely fall apart at the smallest things going wrong. Also I've been prescribed some fairly strong SSRI's and sleeping pills(Inzofresh/Prozac) which I haven't taken yet. Let's hope I never have to. I feel I'm not able to make brave decisions for myself. I'm lazy af, and I'm never excited about new things. New interviews or internships scare the fuck out of me to the point that I don't appear for interviews or just straight up quit internships. It's like I want to learn, but putting efforts and possibility of failure scare me. Due to this I wasted my entire vacations slacking off at home doing absolutely nothing.

One of them, I've pulled him out of depression so many times I only have bad memories with him. I still love him with all my heart and I would start talking to him again in a heartbeat. He hasn't returned any of my calls/messages/desperate cries for attention. I've threatened suicide also with him, to no avail. Sometimes when I'm too lonely, I've left him more than a hundred calls in a single day. He'll still not pick up. It breaks my heart everytime I hear the song he has as his caller tune. I've seen a lot of heartbreak in my life, my mom constantly reminds me how bad I am with maintaining friends. But this guy is on a different level. I'm quite emotionally strong and can somehow survive all this. But I can not for the life of me stop begging him to be in my life. I have literally begged him, so many times to just talk to me, one last time. He makes me feel unworthy of love. The emotional damage I've sustained somehow keeps growing although he hasn't responded at all. I've never poured my heart out like this. I don't even know how anonymous this is going to be and it's midnight and I'm thinking about him. I need help 🤦🏽‍♂️ Any good therapists (not psychiatrist) in Pune area?  Any good professional counsellors in Pune? How do you get over a bad break-up? Like not the immediate phase, I am past that. Quite some time has passed now.

 But sometimes bad memories come rushing back. It's very distracting. Messes up the whole day.

Edit: I know it's a very generic question. How do you deal with envy? Like your friend has a job and you don't, despite having similar skills. Why is it that the past doesn't mean anything to people? Two years o friendship and one year of dating meant absolutely nothing. The one I loved left me for another guy just because he tried committing suicide once. Maybe if I try it too I'll win her back. I don't know. I'm fed up. I'm quitting in a while. I've had enough of people walking over me. Kisi ki fikr karna is a curse. I am so relaxed at the moment and I have never felt like this before. I used to get anxious and stressed and literally my heart rate would increase at the thought of completing a task but now things are slowly changing. I have started meditating, I didn't believe in it earlier but now I do, it does feel nice even though it doesn't last much but sure, some impact is there. I have also gained some control over my overthinking, now I just want to go with the flow, and I tell myself that it is going to be okay and I believe in it too. So yeah, just wanted to say that it does get better, even if the pace of it is as slow as a snail 🐌. I'am a dropper preparing for medical entrance examinations. I want to work hard and put it my best efforts but somehow I can't concentrate and focus. This takes a toll on my studies and my test scores. Many of my acquaintances have cleared the exams. This also bothers me very much sometimes. Other people's opinions about me also disturbs me. Sometimes I feel very complexed by other's achievements. I know I shouldn't feel this,but I can't help it. It gets out of hand sometimes. And then I feel like I'am the biggest failure. It feels like my growth is stunted and everybody around me is achieving one or the other thing. And then it all gets very depressing. Is there anyone else with this kind of problem? I'm was the responsible star child while growing up. Never caused trouble in school or at home. I used to get bullied a lot (there goes my self esteem out the window) and I never brought that home with me. My dad used drink a lot. He'd drink as soon as he got home or sometimes he was already drunk when he gets home. There used to be a fight every night for as long as I can remember. Things used to break, there was a lot of shouting and it'll all end up in him leaving the house in the middle of the night. My mom didn't say much. She'd cry and reset in the morning. Now, I'm 20 and my dad's been dead for 2 years and I don't know how to deal with my emotions. I'm trying my best to get a job and continue studying but it gets really hard sometimes. I have a lot of problems with my personality. My friends & family have told me that I behave weirdly around strangers. I have trouble starting or holding conversations. My sense of humour is weird and I run out of things fast. I have low self esteem and cannot hold my frame in altercations. I have lived a very secluded life since I was a kid which I believe is the reason behind all this. Can you guys recommend any book or YouTube channel or anything about this. I started reading feeling good by David d burns.I have started implementing his techniques to reduce my anxiety. I strongly recommend this book for anyone suffering from mental health issues Any self-help sites, channels in India? So a part of my camera broke yesterday and it looks like [this now](https://imgur.com/a/5vlJyAd). It was feeling really weird to my sister, she even vomited due to this which was very weird to me. Now she can't watch the camera even for a second, she gets goosebumps if she does so and gets a headache. 

After going some research it seems she has (Disturbing image) [Trypophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypophobia). She can't watch the image on the wikipedia page as well. Does anyone have any experience regarding this? Should I ask her to see a doctor? Hi, so 2 months back I finished my college and since then I've been looking for a job/internship. I am a designer now. I've been at home and being at home makes me feel lazy and really out of touch with everything. I don't feel like keeping in touch with people, I'm constantly thinking when will I get out of home.
I got an interview by stroke of luck (I don't want to describe it in any other way, lest I don't get that chance either) and it's in a couple of days. I've been procrastinating preparing for the interview, I don't know what I'll do or what I'll say and I'm scared I'll say some shit and not get the chance again. Because being at home, being lazy, and procrastinating on work has me worried that the one chance that I've got to get out of my house will be gone because I couldn't shake this state of stagnancy off of me. I love my family, please don't misunderstand. It's just I have more independence when I'm away.
I have a partner, and it's a long distance currently. We haven't been getting a lot of time to talk so it's just the regular talk ""good morning, what's up"", and that has been bumming me out, so coupled with ty
he stress about the interview and me trying to move my ass to work but not able to (please imagine my mind feeling like a cow on the road, and I'm a car honking, asking it to move) has been making me feel all sorts of stress and alarm and I'm typing this really fast and I'm just trying to get it off my brain, I don't know if anyone will understand this. Hello fellows. Have had a terrible heartbreak. 

Have realised that staying hydrated is the only thing that matters. Hey. The past 2 years have been really difficult for me.. Especially this year. I've had to give a lot of entrance exams and my marks were just pathetic. It took me a while to understand that it's okay, but my parents were just SO ashamed of me. Everyday I get screwed for 4 hours straight . My mom is not happy with anything I do. She's always comparing me with all her friend's children. She keeps telling me everyday that I'm useless and that she has lost all hopes on me. She assumes a lot of things .. and I can't deal with this everyday.. I am LITERALLY defined by my marks and the way I dress. Apparently it's ""inappropriate"". They have never appreciated me for anything I do. All they find is flaws. I don't get a say in what I want for myself. They decide everything and then blame me when things go wrong.  I cry every single day before I sleep hoping that tomorrow will be better but it just gets worse. When I wear glasses, it triggers my anxiety and I feel stressed and tensed. I have a 6 working dayz job, but one saturday is exception. Usually at that weekend i could not able to sleep at all specialy on sunday night. It makes my whole body numb and mind completely fogged. Lazy and lethargic whole day. Felt like iam the most depressed person. What to do? I met a guy in the first year of my college. He was sweet, compassionate and everything you want a man to be. He told me he liked me and I liked him too but within a month I realized he wasnt giving his all, he wasnt even trying. So I called it off and he dint bother much. Within a few weeks he started dating a girl. I was somehow hoping for him to return,but for a few years he dated her. She was my batchmate too. Its been 6 years and that one month still brothers me. Whenever someone talks about love, he pops up in my head. I dint even date this guy properly. But every guy I went out with after him, were never enough. I have been ruining my relationships ever since. Is this the first love people talk about? Because I dont think i was in love with him. I think i have never been in love. I want to be in love and I want to feel loved but he gets to my head everytime and I feel stupid. I could use any sort of advice. Hi , i am a 21 year old passed out from college last year same time got a job just after college in Chennai. My college years were not that fun as others are . I developed lots of insecurities and they are with me till now. I tend to tell people that I am strong but I am not . Loneliness scares me.
Past few months I am at home . I developed some kind of brain infection and my right eye stopped working. I was on medication for about 4 months. 
Past 4 months was supposed to make me healthy and physically it has but mentally I have become more depressed . I cry all the time . I try to keep people even my mom and dad away from me . I don't talk to them or I just say rude things so that they hate me . I don't think I deserve any kind of warmth or love from anyone as I have done nothing but just being a burden to everyone . I have so many insecurities , so many fear that I am scared I won't be able to make it in life.
I had many ambitions but now I just feel nothing as if I have done something wrong and I have to live with this. I can't share it to my parents because they think depression can be treated my medicine but that's not true . I need someone to take away this pain that I don't know why I feel all the time. I want someone to make me see myself more than just a person  with a bunch of insecurities. I can't share with my friends because for them I am very strong and I love being like this. But it's all an act. I am not strong . Even a tiny argument makes me cry . I cry all the time . I thought it's all because I am sick but it's not that. So when I was in class 10th,I was touched by same sex people several times in a public bus,in front of everybody,many saw,but didn't take any action. I was afraid so I also didn't do anything. It was like that for 6 or 7 times,but some time later,I decided that was that and I took a lighter,took it near his man piece(he was telling me to touch it) and said if he ever did it to anyone else or at the time me,I would find him and burn it.This was the third person. I came to know the first person was arrested thorough an anonymous tip,but was released after several weeks,because A) It was anonymous tip B) No one came forward so no proof. Now three and half years later,I wish it never happened or I wish I was strong enough to take action. This affected me a lot,I had depression and ADHD ever since I was a child but it became my dominant personality after these incidents. The worse part,the people who saw me being touched and forced to touch, thought it was a licence and started doing it to other kids,luckily I was strong enough to use action against him. Now I am cigarette abuse, alcohol abuse and other things,I have tried really hard and reduced my alcohol intake to once a month or once every two or three months.My fitness reduced,I became fat,I became more afraid about what will people think. I know therapy might be good,but it might be hard to spend this much money now as I am not having much economic freedom. Saying these in a public forum helps me a bit so that is why I am sharing. Often, Most of the time I feel like a ""Nobody"". I get this vibe from every one, even from my school friends and relatives, they all underestimate me all the time, doesn't appreciate me to the point where i have starved for validation for so long that I don't have any self esteem left, even the easiest things a person can do, i struggle with. I'm stuck in life. I dont have any real friends who care or appreciates me because the ones that i have follow narrow minded ideologies which i doesn't really go well with and when i try to talk to them and give them my perspective they belittle me and try to trick me in a condescending way and disrespects me . Did i tell you they really take me for granted. I dont find the friends who have the same mindset, wavelength as i have which really sucks (this could also be because i live in a small town where every other person is the same) because of this i feel so lonely. Professionally nothing is happening, personally nothing really happened because of my introverted/shy nature. 
My parents are getting old specially my father, he  have so many health issues and also handicapped so i have to be near home to take care of them so the option of me getting out of this rusty city is not even there. I wanted to study abroad but due to family obligations i am not able to pursue that and that is also weighting me down because i am left with no option. I know what kind of person i want myself to shape into and what kind of surrounding i want to create and  live into specially friends and people, but I don't really know what to do or where to start. On top of that family and relatives are thinking and trying to get me married to someone so that they can get off from their responsibilities where right now i am no where near in every aspect and ready to indulge myself into marriage. 
Everyone around me is doing something in life which bums me out sometimes but i don't really get that to my head but I'm really tired of being judged always already as a failure and always being taken for granted. Everyone deserves love and respect. I don't treat anybody like this i always have empathy for everyone but why people, who are close in relation or your friends act such way. I'm sorry for being so unarticulate and so cacophony about my issues but I cant really process myself properly. I got into a relationship a year ago with a certain guy. But since the past few months, we'd been fighting constantly over different issues. I want to break up with him as I know this relationship isn't good for me, but I don't really have any other friends and he's the only person I have who I can share stuff with. I would like to have him as a friend but if I break up with him, he'll completely cut off all contact with me and I don't want that as then I'll be completely alone. 
What do I do? I would like to study well for each exam but I find myself day-dreaming for hours every time I open the book or even after reading just a few lines. I just cannot concentrate or focus completely on studying, until the last few hours. How do I overcome this? I really really want to pursue fashion designing from NIFT Delhi so i gave my entrance but i scored very less and consequently only places like Patna, Raebareli and shillong were left. So i chose textile in Patna. But obviously I'm not very thrilled as i would've been if I'd gotten a better centre like Mumbai or Bangalore. Still my parents are really happy but at the same time very worried that I'll be going to a city in Bihar. Lots of people tell me cities dont matter, my hardwork matters but deep down i really feel that there's so much more to a campus than just academics. I dont want to spend my 4 best years in a place where I can't wear what i feel like without 100 eyes gawking me at the same time. My father says i can write the exam again next year. But when i think about one year it feels like a thousand. The wait. The uncertainty whether or not I'll make the cut next year. The people around me. This is all stressful. I see people from my coaching going to places like Mumbai and Bangalore. Places where they're gonna get maximum exposure and the best of everything. I feel the insecurity that they're gonna fare better than me. I dont know from where to begin with. I had A troublesome childhood. My parents used to fight and hurl abuses at each other,  sometimes due to drinking issues of my dad, sometimes due to money issues or some family problem. It was very hurtful seeing them fighting like that. They both are somewhat insecure individuals and the worst part is that they have feeded their insecurities in me. I have been a victim of emotional abuse during my entire childhood. Never felt appreciated or recognised for anything. Scored 91℅ in 10th boards only to hear ""could've done better"".i was constantly compared to my friends, cousins elder to me, younger to me, doesn't matter. I had been bullied at school and could never answer them because I never had any emotional support. Struggling all my life till now.. I am in a top tier institution pursuing masters. Things haven't got any better. I have no self esteem or confidence left in me. I can barely talk to my professors. I am unable to perform according to my potential. Can't concentrate on studies. I also had a really bad break up during my  class 12th exam. The guy lied to me all the time only to ditch me later and calling all sorts of bad things about me at my back. I had terrible boards in class 12th, nearly from where my academic downfall started. Now I don't even feel like doing things I like. I end up procrastinating most to the time. Now that the placement season of my college is approaching in a month.. I don't have any confidence to grab any offer. Moreover I do not have even a decent CGPA right now. During the past one year I faced different sort of struggles in my life. One of my professors miss understood something I said and took it on his ego, only for me to face the repercussions during my entire first year. He said so many hurtful things that really hit my mind hard. He almost mentally harrassed me and made sure I get the lowest in his subject assignments and projects in both the semesters. Numerous things have happened with me in my life. Been constantly looked down upon a coz of  low CGPA is one of those. I am unable to maintain a healthy relationship with anyone. Several other really bad incidents happened in my childhood. And now I feel totally deprived of love.sometimes i feel I don't even deserve it. My life has never been anywhere close to even normal. My mum to whom I was closest to always supported the other person and not me coz that was the easiest, to subjugate a child instead of opposing an elder. Sometimes I feel I am filled with hatred. I dislike myself more than anyone else can do. I don't know where to go from here. I recently quit my job of 4 years due to the toxic environment at my work place and although I'm happy with my decision and I can say that it's made my life much more peaceful, it's had a great impact on my mental health and I've never slept so peacefully in a really long time.
However, I don't have another offer or employment to look forward to and that's making me anxious and I'm having alot of negative thoughts surrounding it. 
I don't question my decision of quitting at all - I just feel highly underconfident when it comes to getting another job and that's stressing me out alot. I want to know if I have mental health problem. I think I do. what should i do to identify? I am about to step willingly into one of my worst nightmares. To be admitted. This does not look good The relationship I began with is not the same in which I am currently. Because when we started it, there were lot of things that was promised to grow both of us, mentally, physically and professionaly. But nothing of those sorts has happened. I have felt that my partner is just materialistic. I am not comfortable with telling all the details here. Is there a way I can solve this. I am just not feeling myself lately. There is so much pressure I am getting from others, my parents and my partner. I am not able to achieve my professional goals. When I talk about this with my partner she will belittle me that I am a selfish person who always think about myself. I don't know where should I take advice from. 

Sorry that post is not an elaborative one. But I feel that I need help to deal with this pressure.

[Previous threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search/?q=Weekly%20mental%20health%20support%20thread&restrict_sr=1&sort=new)",AutoModerator," I took a walk today, after ~1 month, I feel so good mentally and physically. For the past one month I have been dealing with so many issues, first my amazon order got messed up and lost like Rs. 400 due to it. Then a phone I ordered online was dead on arrival had to drive 250KM in one single day to get it checked and then replaced it. 

Then my left eye got fucked again(I have uveitis) and now I can only see properly from left eye, right eye is blurry. Now after 2-3 days pain started in left eye too, I hope I don't lose vision in left eye too, it's temporary but it's scary to have blurry vision in both the eyes.

Now yesterday my macbook refused to turn on and I was so depressed, it turned on somehow after I charged it for 5-6 hours.

Dealing with so much shit, I have ankylosing spondylitis too and have 24/7 backpain, my wrist is fucked and I'm permanently disabled. My GF of 11 years cheated on me last year and I started drinking and smoking regularly after that. Now have stopped drinking and smoke like once a week or once every 2 weeks.

Took a walk today, feeling much relaxed. When I think about my life there are positive things too, my family and friends are very supportive and are always there for me. I have a decent work from home job, so I live with my parents in the mountain, far from air pollution and metro life. I have always hated Sundays. There's too much time on hand to over think and feel like shit afterwards. Literally did not speak to anyone in the last 48 hours. Spent most of my time indoors cleaning my PC, inboxes, filing tax returns etc. Did go out to get my vitamin D. Literally no communication with any human - in person or text or voice. Had switched the phone off as well.  
I did feel good though. Am I better off without any people in my life? I’m so scared of getting married as I feel I still am a kid at heart.. how do people get the confidence to take that big step? [deleted] Past few days I'm sleeping at a late hour. I think I had a mild seizure when I was asleep last night (tongue-smack and body pain). I don't feel like telling it to my parents. For them, this disease is not even existing (FYI I'm on meds). There's no point telling them anything about my mental health because they have provided for everything (except for emotional support). I've to rely on other activities. Talking to online friends isn't of much help, because they can't see you and aren't in a position to sympathize. Blocked a few of them, it does not feel okay doing that. Nobody wants to deal with an emotional volatile person tbh. I sometimes feel that my life/issues/problems are so convoluted and assimilated into each other that no matter what I do, I won't be able to fix it. And on top of it, I have lost all motivation to do anything. Feel like have fallen so deep into the hole that it's impossible to climb out of it. Not having good friends (pushed them all away), no relationship, not learning any new stuff. Just wasting away I feel exhausted every single moment of the day.. I feel no satisfaction in what I’m doing.. I’m in the final year of UG and the fear of the future is looming.. I have some amazing friends and I have the fear that one day I’ll lose them or lose contact with them.. Does anyone know any good therapists/psychiatrists in NCR, preferably with experience with LGBT people? There is no hope for the planet this is what I believed and to this day it's didn't seem otherwise. Yesterday I watched a TEDx video on buthan and it was amazing nothing was more delightful than seeing someone try to save the environment I hoped I could do it too. But today here I am typing this while more than 30 trees are being cut down right next to my house. Do I want to do something? yes,can I no because it's being done by the local gang so I would be shot on spot.

There are many trees near my house they are a part of a mango orchard, I hope they are not cut down any time soon. Can I get some help from anyone to help me protect these orchards. The owner is a old man once he dies I believe it would be cut down too. I feel so much rage at the sound of chainsaws cutting down those trees.

BTW I live in West Bengal and here the situation is very sure people have no awareness, even my father is the type of person who would likely cut down all my trees and be happy about the cash.

Are there any authorities that I can contact or NGOS? I think I might have ADHD. I was doing some research on why I feel anxiety / can’t focus / procrastinate indefinitely when I came across a post which fit me exactly. Did some further research and I have all the symptoms that someone with ADHD may have. Not sure what to do with this knowledge ... In a new country as my parents want me to do a masters. I am seriously stressed out. I left a good job. I have finished my masters on my family's demand but I kept failing in one very hard subject, last time the exam paper was easy and it went very well, but result just came out and I have failed again, I didn't ask for any of this, I didn't want this but still it pains me when I saw my family's disappointed faces when they heard the news, at that moment I felt very suicidal no I'm not that weak that I'll die for something I hate but I keep thinking about suicide like some kind of fantasy.

Now I have last 2 shot left for this exam if I fail in both of them my degree will get cancelled. Fuck my life, I don't care about this degree anyways but I have put so much time, my parents money and my energy into this, I just wanna pass the exam ( totally happy if get lowest grade possible to pass exam ) and be done with this. Living itself is a big burden. 
Any skill you want to learn takes an enormous amount of hard work. You will never get anything you want in life. You will always have to settle for less. Any girl you want to talk to, there are already too many talking to her. Most people you know will leave you. Everyone you know will die. Heck, even you will die. It takes a lot of food and natural resources to stay healthy. Every person is trying to push their views on life on you. The government controls your life. You will have to live your life following some idiots rules or you will be in jail. The food we eat is dosed with chemicals. Any food you order, the person making it is always trying to save money. No matter how much you work hard, some fool with no knowledge is grouped with you. You have to sell your soul to use any technology (ads). In the end, just to die like a piece of shit and be buried and pass on your suffering to your children. For avid book readers i would suggest power of now and feeling good by david d burns.Two great books for anyone suffering from mental health issues Taking the first step to go to therapy is making me very anxious that I keep postponing it. Life sucks anyway isn't it? Nothing Major 

Just kinda fell for a girl and then weaved dreams of being with her.

&#x200B;

We had an event and i clmwas managing and she messaged me for some help. We started casually and then i came to know her interest match with mineand i  flirting pretty well with her and she did respond but then noticed she wouldn't  start a single conversation. It was always me and slowly she stopped replying fast.

&#x200B;

This led me to try being a bit more charming by hitting the gym and trying to act smart when talking with her as she once said she was into 

Fit  

Cheerful 

Mature 

Kind of guys. Lol.

&#x200B;

(The timeline is like 2 months for this whole fiasco)

&#x200B;

Not much happened. So i took it upon myself that ill give her sometime to msg me and waited.

Nothing happened.

So i went ahead and send it over text that i like her more than as a friend. She said No.

Since then i was weaving up dreams that if i got better and she saw it, shell come back with along the side just thinking of her as a bitch on the side for easily taking the compliments that i sent to her.

&#x200B;

So vacation ends and we meet. I talk just like i do but its obviously  awkward. She notices and i say it to her face as to why she didnt msg me anymore(still thought i had hope).Then the clg   bell rings Break ends class starts then over and we go home. I did as funny as possible but i did see her be kinda surprised that i asked her this.

&#x200B;

Receive a text at night of just a Hi. Didn't  reply because i had too much in my mind. 

Next day i replied and after some banter she asks me if im awkward around her, 

Obviously  

Is what i said, and also that its hard after the rejection.

She says she respects my feelings.

 Im getting this weird high that i had not felt for a pretty long time all the while this convo.(All on whatsapp)

She says Lets try to be friends. I say yes secretly plotting i will win her back.

We talked more where i got the impression that she wants to stay friend and was kinda trying to help me move on.

&#x200B;

She also said she stopped talking to me when she saw how heavily i was flirting with her. Damn it How obvious am i, i thought. Ended it with jokes and shit. Their was a storm brewing up in my mind so i went ahead and Got 2 Cigh and contemplated what would be the right thing to do.

&#x200B;

Finally accepted kii nahin milegi, then just felt sad again. Did like 100 jumping jacks and 30 improper pushup and some squats to get my mind off. Felt like i had weed but weak effect.

&#x200B;

The thing is, its been a long time that i felt like this for someone. 

Pehli baar kisiko direct propose kiya tha. 23 yo so yeah its kinda not very pround thing. I even told this to her.

Talking to her was like It was like i was warm in the right places when i talked. It was a different kind of high.

&#x200B;

Now she is gone. More like still there(as friend) but my expectations are and the habits are still there.

I go and workout i think of her.

Stress comes up i think of her.

Getting bored then i daydream ilill be winning her back soon.

&#x200B;

She thinks im an important friend and i only was with her because i liked her and wanted it to blossom intointo something.

&#x200B;

On one hand:

I think this whole thing went up my mind because i never got this sort of attention from anyone this attractive and so compatible before.

On the other i think she enjoyed the flirting but lost interest when i went a bit too high.

&#x200B;

Damn it this makes no and so much sense at times that i just want to get all the information and then build up a theorem to just figure this out.

&#x200B;

Help anyone. Feel free to put any advice you guys feel like. Is Vimhans Delhi good for depression? Any good psychiatrist in Delhi NCR?

Also, is psychometric test/personality assessment necessary? It's quite costly. Anyone has experience with mind.fit? I went for a free therapy session, my only qualm is that the lady seems to have been in the working for only around 5 years as per her LinkedIn. So I don't know if she has experience. Its the same for almost everyone in mind.fit. but she seemed alright when I talked to her, but there was a certain kiddish vibe I got. Should I be more open.",Reddiquette,2019-07-21 11:32:38

[Previous threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search/?q=Weekly%20mental%20health%20support%20thread&restrict_sr=1&sort=new)",AutoModerator," I don't feel good at home, I have realized. I work ina remote city and I live alone. Not like I don't love my parents, but the excitement of being at home fades in a couple hours only after reaching home.

I feel bad about it. My collagues ask me why don't I take leaves and visit home. It's difficult to explain and I feel something is wrong with me I don't have much to say . I have accepted the reality of life and what it has to offer for me . And I will probably live through it till the day I die . Okay I think it needs to be said especially when it's a thread made solely for mental health. 

Whatever low and depressing thoughts that you have,  like 'I am done with life now',  'There is no point of hard work',  'It won't improve. I feel hopeless',  these all are not normal thought sequences.  These are common in depression and depression is a clinical disorder.  It can be treated and managed by going to a psychiatrist remember that.  

If you are feeling depressed for more than 2-3 weeks now with getting tired easily and not able to get the same pleasure from things that you like are symptoms of clinical depression.  So don't hesitate to go to psychiatrist.  They won't judge you as it is their job to treat this to their best ability. I just seem to have lost zest for life. Everything is bland and pointless. Grinding through the weekdays to idle and waste away on weekends. I am dissatisfied with where I am in my life right now. Everyone I know seems to have progressed leaps and bounds ahead. It's not that I didn't tried. I did with all my might but things didn't worked out due to some reasons. Now it's kind of like I have accepted my fate. I don't even want to try.

&#x200B;

I have stopped interacting with my old friends. I know it sounds very vain but I feel absolutely worthless and incompetent in their company. They will be talking about their wonderful life/job/relationship while I silently rot inside. I am so far behind in every sphere of life I can think of. And the thing is I don't even want to do anything about it. Just idle and waste away. Loneliness and solitude reign the weekends. Apathy and indifference on the remaining days. I don't feel like there's any point in life sometimes The girl I told  I had a crush on and got rejected by  now works with me. She told everyone about this. Even though I try to act cool it hurts at times. She behaves very rudely with me. I can't change my company as I have signed a bond of 2 years. Anxiety disorder is a real fucking bitch. I overthink everything until it doesn't make sense and then I freak out. Have panic attacks randomly. Can't handle the smallest of issues and conflicts without feeling like I'm dying.

My relationship with my bf is also getting strained because of this. It's sad also because he's genuinely the best I've ever had, and he loves me a lot. I keep panicking about us and keep feeling like he deserves better than me, which is sort of becoming a self fulfilling prophecy. I'm afraid that they'll leave me, I become clingy/distant and then they actually leave. 

Don't know what to do to break the cycle, accept his love, and just deal better with life. I am an engineer. Fresh Graduate.

I joined 2 weeks ago in a Finance Sector as Bussiness Analyst and Product Manager.

New job has a lot of expectations from me.  
They say no questions are silly. But, I can't ask silly questions.  
They don't care where I get the data from or how do I do it.  
They just want it done.  
And that's what i am to deliver. I am hugely intimidated. Guys Hear me out, I have just started my corporate job and I m not liking that, my anxiety disorder isn't helping. I already have a decent gate score. Part of me wants to drop it all and prepare for IISC Scared about a lot of things. Off to IIT BHU next month with electronics if I get it. If not, electrical. Always thought cracking Adv and fulfilling that childhood dream would be something special. But now, it's like the life has been sucked out of me. Terrified about leaving home, leaving my mom behind. Keep worrying about job prospects, how to maintain GPA, how to pursue my tentative dream of an MBA, how to adjust with the honestly challenging living conditions. The list goes on. In a long distance relationship and I miss her terribly nowadays. Won't see her for a year because she's preparing for medical entrances in Kota. And I don't want her to get demotivated or distracted because of my stupid angsty drama. Dad is mildly disappointed because he wanted IIT KGP but I'm not keen on pursuing chemical. He doesn't smile nowadays at all. Not expecting any advice as such. Just writing out stuff that I can't really share easily anywhere else. I need to ask because I haven't really spoken to anyone about this. How common are suicidal fantasies (among depressed people)? Whenever I'm having a panic attack (quite often) I imagine putting a bullet through my brain or a sword going through my heart or a guillotine decapitating me. And its been happening for years now. I know it's unhealthy but I have no frame of reference for this but I've never even read of anyone thinking like this so I guess it's not very common.Also fantasizing like this makes me feel good.

Lol typing this out just sounds so bizarre and horrible How to find positivity in life again ? 
It has become difficult nowadays. Anxiety and procrastination has already made me feel much lonely. Destroyed my closest friends over weed and serenity. Left football my passion over a permanent injury. I thought emptiness was a fluke,but now i feel it more than any other feeling i get. I am a graduate and 25 now and jobless.
I hope i get through this life with a positive feeling. After all the clouds and the storm,the sun shines brightest I am afraid of procrastination these days. What happens is that my mind wants me to day-dream about all the things I want to happen. And most of the times I am disappointed when reality strikes. So I now stop my mind from thinking what I really want to happen and start thinking of the sequence of events that I do not really want to happen. I know it sounds lame, vague and confusing. I haven't felt strong emotions (apart from anxiety) for a few years now. I haven't been very sad or very happy or very angry or even affection for anyone. It's always just been anxiety and panic attacks and suicide idealization. Don't think that's a good sign. The cut-offs for my dream course in my dream college were supposed to have been released today, but haven't yet. I've started hating my body and looks way too much. I'm terrified of my parents and grandfather aging. It hurts to see them fall ill. 
I'm drowning in anxiety. Feels like my heart is floating around my chest, having been uprooted. Sometimes, I feel like there's a blackhole where my heart was, consuming all my energy, just digging deep into my chest. My parents wants me to get married, still I don't have a job very less qualifications living in a rural area when I suppose to be living in metropolitan city cuz all my 25 years I've been stayed in cities, it feels like I don't belong here, life is shit jobs are not above 10k especially for me and I'm stuck I want to live my life and my parents literally fucked me up for life. I want to study for that they don't have money unless I get married to their choice of girl and what not I want to runaway but society don't give a fuck about people who leave their parents because of course they are more important maa baap ki seva. I'm fucked sad and stuck. When I try to get up parents try every tool in their arsenal to bring me right back to ground my wings are cut and I'm fucked. Would like to share this good long lasting feeling. Started reading 'The 5 am Club' by Robin Sharma a week ago.

Thrashing a decade of struggles to get up early morning, got up before sunrise. Worked out 20/20/20 rule. Exercise. Meditation. Books.

Feeling way way better. Would suggest everyone of you to read the book and start your day. Start YOUR day which is coming close you.

Join 'The 5 am Club' with me & other millions around the globe! Hi all, I think I need some help from a psychiatrist. Have some noobie questions:

1. Where/how can I find a good doc in Mumbai? I can't ask my family/friends for recommendations :(

2. How much do psychiatrists charge?

Thank you. well, mental health is shit for me and my SO both. I have posted here before and have received great suggestions but they haven't been easy to implement.

Also, we aren't keen to accept that this is just what and how it is. We damn wanna fight, but we probably need to get married first.

Mental health professionals are costly and finding a good one is a game of luck. With rising costs and falling savings, it is difficult to convince thyself to go to any psychologists. I'm a 2 years experienced professional. I used to be a top performer at my previous company. Knew everything inside out. Quit because there was nothing new to learn. Joined a different company. A couple months into my current job, and it's already too overwhelming. They have really high expectations which I'm unable to meet. This is making me very anxious and I'm losing my confidence. Already feel like quitting this job. Life sucks. Just can't do anything about it. Have to keep living like this. It's a never ending turmoil anyway. And shit keeps on happening. Q: if I'm looking to get mental health professional/therapy and I'm looking, say on Practo, what kind of doctor do I look for?

More details:
So. I'm looking to get some mental health support. While I can usually handle my depression just fine (was borderline suicidal in my teens but now I'm mostly doing alright except on bad days), I'm now in a place where I have lesser access to my friends, am a closet-atheist living in a conservative family, and having a lot of general chaos and no reliable outlet to sort things out with. To a point that I feel absolute apathy for everyone and everything in life and can't really pursue any passions. One thing that's affecting me mentally in a negative way is the constant stress about my future, so I am going to ask about some career advice here, I have just completed my BA degree, now I have a few options but I don't have much of a control on them, the first one being, go abroad, countries like Canada, Australia or maybe even USA, this will require huge financial expenditure, which will be more then difficult for me to gather, the second option is, opt for MA and study for civil services exams simultaneously, this will be a little difficult for me, because I am already sick of studying and the thought of doing so for another two years, well it basically appals me, but this option is more plausible financially but I am not sure if I'll be able to crack the exams, so I am uncertain about going through with this plan of action too, another option, take one or two private jobs with a salary of about 10,000 in the beginning, and then study for the higher level exams, or another option is that I can go for some courses in Information Technology, this was actually suggested to me by an acquaintance of mine, the way they suggested it was much more convincing then the way I've just blatantly wrote it.

So, help me r/India, give me advice as to what I should go through with, because this shit is eating me up, and I want to just take a decision and finally move on in life. I want to quit Medicine. Being self aware and self deprecating sucks big time. I know doing this is wrong, but lets do it anyway. Fml. [deleted]",Reddiquette,2019-06-23 13:24:38

Idk if its my problem, or Im caring too much. I find it really difficult to talk to people. Everyone I talk with starts to ignore me, or kind of contradict me in any way possible. I wait, and listen to them talk, and when my chance comes up, its contradicted and ignored.



These days, I want to stay away from people, just do my work and move on. Also the depression has taken hold of me in a very menacing way. I dont feel joy in anything, and life is in a downward spiral .


Am I wrong? Where should I change? How can I make life atleast 'okay'? Life is very hard for a jobless graduate.

I want to do something else but family is forcing me to do something else cuz I was unable to get job in my field since a year.

I'm depressed and then family pressure, I don't even like to talk with anyone let it be family or friends. Loved someone but could not say anything to her and then here I'm crying every single night cuz of all this from 1 year.

Family take me as a joke. Started getting anger issues as they were forcing me, mood is mostly off, there is no one whom I can say my feelings.

All this tension and family pressure is killing me from inside but don't know why I'm still alive.

Depression is a joke in India, no one understands until you suicide. Everyone at my home is super busy. I live with my mom, and her two sisters. All of them are busy with their professional lives. Due to this, they come home tired and we have our dinner at 2 or 3am. My sleep schedule has become pretty erratic.
    
I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate on my studies because of my aunt's constant yelling. It's like she can't accept her mistakes and constantly blames everyone else for her life. The same aunt has a 10 year old daughter who can't walk or talk because of severe cerebral palsy. I feel like my aunt  deliberately stays at her office so that she doesn't have to face the stark reality at home. This has taken its toll on me and my brother who are effectively forced to live our lives according to our cousin's needs. We're forced to take care of her everyday her mom is outside the house. This has led me into a downward spiral of guilt and depression. 

I used to be a good student but I now I'm just another brick in the wall. I feel so utterly lost. Any mention of how things aren't right with our family having late dinners(at 2am or so) and me sleeping through the day(except for going to my coaching) gets me a severe yelling from my family about how I'm making excuses and how I'm trying to blame them for my low marks. I don't know now. I feel so tired of this unproductive lifestyle but every time I try to make a change, my family does something to bring me back again and I'm back to ground zero, yet again. I don't have any friends and my  dad is out of the picture.

I used to be so innocent and full of life, marvelling at every tiny change in the hues of the sky and somewhere along the road, that part of me just died. I've become so bitter, and cynical. I barely recognize myself anymore. I want to do better and I know I can. I don't know how to get out of this rut. I feel like I'm looking for excuses for my eventual failure and I feel guilty for letting down everyone who's ever believed in me. I don't know what to do. 

Help me. My life is became black hole (context from earlier mental health thread https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b222o4/mental_health_discussion_thread_170319/eisdoxv/ ) the more I try to get out of it by discussing with friends, problem is worsening for me. Once promising career with enough friends now juggling with career and hardly any friends to talk. This weekend only I tried to connect with two friends but no one have time for or are busy with some other things :( We're all a bunch of pretentious fucks [deleted] I have major anxiety and some insecurity issues that I feel like are getting in the way of improving myself  
I am currently using Insight Timer app for practising guided meditations daily, I feel it has helped me to some extent  
To derive maximum out of it I just wanted some pointers on how to structure my approach towards this practise Everywhere I go, I find disease, pollution, garbage and what not. Now even those places that were deemed to be good for some respite are just piles of garbage. People here are judgemental, snobbish and lack any kind of empathy towards other humans. Doctors breed patients, police just look for their own gain, teachers just beat the shit out of kids etc etc etc. They die for money and they kill for money - these people won't let go a 10 paisa coin from gutter. I feel like I am trapped and don't know where should I go. Because even we trolls sometime see that enough jokes and something needs to be done about it. If I can't change the world, I should atleast change myself and my surroundings but can't see anything past the smog. We are doomed. Just got to know one of my colleagues is suffering from depression. What can I do to help her? I get attached to people even I don't speak to them a lot. Whenever someone leaves it hits hard and I go on a downward spiral.  When I left for college, it was home and schoolfriends. When I left college for work it was my college friends. I mean many of these people at once left my lives and only a handful stayed being important to me. I was attached to so many people and it hurt losing them. I take my sweet time to get attached to someone in the first place. It's worse with someone that once I lost the attachment with. I'm nowhere near as attached to my family as I used to be during my school days. I have never been in a romantic relationship. All I have is friends. Now they're all getting married and moving away. I find it hard to connect with them and they with me. Their life and priorities become different. Understandable.  
But I'm struggling to find that sort of attachment which lasts a really long time. All the friendships i've made in the last 4-5 years have worn off.  
Clearly I'm bad at any kind of relationships and people, but the thought of not closeness in any kind of relationship is freaking me out because once these two friends get married (which they will soon), I won't have anyone I'm attached to or even close to.  
  
tl;dr lonely and sad Does anyone suffer from an Impostor syndrome at work?

If yes, do you take steps to overcome it?

My manager has been consistently saying that I am one of the best performers he has, although I don't feel like it and many a times I feel like I am not contributing enough and whatever i achieve at work is a sham and not worth anything..As if I am working towards a dead end and not being really productive..

This has been playing on my mind for quite a while and sometimes i just feel that I would be found out as I am not good enough..So i strive to work harder and it is affecting my work life balance.. Not sure if this is the right thread for this, but I was looking for a health insurance policy for my brother (who has Bipolar and personality disorder) and his wife and kid son. I tried asking around policybazaar, but they said most insurance companies don't cover someone who has a mental health illness.   


I am out of clue about what to do about this, would appreciate any help/suggestions into this.   


He isn't very well off financially and stays in Dehradun, does anyone know of any good therapists there? [removed] I am taking medications for clinical depression for more than a year. Some doctors predicted it could be Bipolar disorder type II. But unfortunately no one around me are aware of mental health. They are thinking that it’s not a big issue but I am taking it very seriously. All are educated but still they don’t know the difference between sadness and depression. I am tired of explaining things. Every one thinks I am fine.",Reddiquette,2019-07-07 11:32:36

She started laughing and said who even votes anymore. There is no day off and dont even get this sort of thing started in the company. I got pissed. Told her it was my democratic right and as per the law I was entitled to a leave. Her face went into ""Did this this corporate slave just tell me the law?"" and proceeded to go and talk to the HR. In the evening HR sent out a company wide mail saying if anyone wanted to take a leave to go and vote, they were entitled to do so. I thought I would be cheered by my fellow slaves but to my surprise none of them had any intention of voting and my manager is furious with me. Needless to say, I took the day off today and cast my vote. 

Also, I might be filling out the application form for Pradhan Mantri Berozgar Yojna tomorrow. Wish me luck bois. 

Jai Hind. request: go out and vote. 

then come and discuss here. Go out an vote people, your country needs you to exercise your right. Are the young not voting?  


While standing in line to vote my first observation today was that there were no millenniums at the booth. The average age of the vote ranged from 40-60 years. This made me wonder, are the young not voting? I messaged my friends who are part of this “woke generation” and have legitimate grievances against the party in power, did you vote? No, we did not. Why? Oh, because we don’t have voter id cards, our names is not on the list, how do we register etc.   


It is extremely disappointing to note that educated Indians aren’t able to figure out how to exercise their franchise. Indian Express recently published an article which stated that ONLY 30% of the voters between the age of 18-21 are registered. In contrast, the percentage of all eligible voters who are enrolled is 63.75 per cent. To quote that article –   
“*Before the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, EC data showed that of the 1.79 lakh new voters on average in each constituency, the 18-19 age group accounted for about 24 per cent or around 43,000. The winning margin was less than this in 226 Lok Sabha constituencies in the 2009 elections.”*   


Why aren’t young people voting in India? 1. They’ve moved in the past years for work, education etc and do not know how to navigate their way through the bureaucratic hurdles and get themselves registered. 2. There is no mechanism in place where a person can vote for their constituency without being physically present. 3. Or is it something grimmer? A lack of trust in the system, that feeling that one vote won’t make a difference so why put in the effort at all?   


P.S – Mostly a rant but what were your observations at the polling booth today? The next time I hear Bengaluru and Chennai people complain about anything, I am going to give all them a piece of my mind. Less than 55% average voting. Voter turnout out was 92.3% (population  approximately 1650) in my village.

This was my first election where i was involved completely.

- Went door to door campaign in 24 villages in my mandal. It came to approximately 10-13km a day (Google fit)

- did door to door campaign in my village 3 times

- distributed 🍺 & ₹ (i know)

- made sure everyone in village voted. Made calls to people residing outstation to come and vote (gave fare)

- arranged 2 auto rickshaws for old and disabled.

- gave a small speech on not to vote for corrupt and vote for development (was tensed, crowd of 1300)

- made sure polling booth arrangements (water, shade, chairs, preference to old & needy) and mock polling were right.

- waited till EVMs were sealed and sent (was 10pm)

- personal expenses of 30000.

If you have any questions, i can answer them. one guy hacked to death at a polling booth in Telangana Voting turnouts at 11 AM:

Could the pic for the mega thread not have been something like the Indian flag ? I didn't expect Andhra to be so violent during the polls. Telangana was much more peaceful during its assembly elections last December. Voted for the first time today. Did so some 8 hours ago at a Noida booth. Got inked. Was chuffed AF. But the initial happiness has turned into sour skepticism. An afternoon shower, and a post lunch handwash later, the ink is already faded.

Like, how?! BJP fielding Saadhvi Pragya is biggest case of shooting yourself in the foot.

What will they achieve by this?  Hardcore Hindu voters will vote for them anyways.

Its the fence sitter who will be shoed away.

This Demonitization type false bravado will cost BJP dearly. Andhra Pradesh likely to record above 70% polling despite EVM glitches according to local news reports.

Talked to policeman on duty at my station- he has been working since yesterday 9 am at the station and will not be able to vote since he cannot leave till polling is over. I am still wondering that how is it they called me to call my vote again saying that the first time it didn't get through! Just voted.

It was satisfying to see the election symbol and name of the candidate I voted for light up in the VVPAT machine.

I'm happy that it works as intended. Hi guys. I have a question which may seem silly. But I'm a first time voter and would love some advice to better understand whom to vote for.

My question is, does the MP elected actually have much of an impact on the local constituency? Or is he more of a representative in the central govt simply there to support his party without much impact on the constituency?

>  Braving the hot sun, a 108-year-old woman cast her vote in the neighbouring Thane district of Maharashtra. Vithabai Damodar Patil, perhaps one of the oldest voters in the State, exercised her franchise at a polling booth in Kopri village, which is part of the Thane Lok Sabha Constituency.

> Talking to reporters after coming out of the polling booth, the centenarian said she voted for a “good” candidate, keeping in mind the development of her village. Choosing between the shit burger and the turd sandwich is your democratic right, don't forget to vote. And don't waste your vote on genuinely good candidates (who usually lose their deposit) because 99% of the voters won't vote for anyone other than the two most popular parties. I feel like choice is basically non existent in our system of elections. There is no such thing as free and fair elections. The only people one would consider casting a vote for would be people belonging to popular political parties. 
The rest of the candidates are completely ignored. 
I will be casting my vote in Gurgaon and I have absolutely no idea about the candidates contesting from my constituency. I don't even think I can accredit this to my ignorance which is ample. 
I tried searching for the current Member of Parliament online and I didn't find much. Don't even know what bills he's responsible for tabling. 
And I have no clue about the other candidates, independent or otherwise. 
I will basically be blindly pressing a button with the symbol of a political party which I believe will do the least harm. And it's not like the media helps, I would really want the people from my constituency to enter into healthy debates so I can understand their opinions on life. But no such luck. 
What the hell should I do? Some people didn't take kindly to my predicting the UP Lok Sabha tally in a separate post. So I'm writing it here. 

From my research I came to the following conclusion.
  
MGB= 41 
BJP = 30
INC = 9

I've based this on the following factors. 
1) 2014 and 2009 result percentage. 

2) Previous winning party till the 80s.

3) Whether the constituency is Metropolitan, Semi-Urban or Rural. 

4) Candidates. Caste/Religion. Celebrity or not. Outsider or local. Heavyweight or underdog. 

5) Religious and Caste breakup of constituencies. 

If someone would like to dissect this, constituency wise, I'm up for spending some time on it with you. Central forces personnel allegedly fired once in the air in Poduma area Dubrajpur in Birbhum constituency to bring the situation under control after villagers threw stones at the security personnel. The bullet hit a wall of the polling station.

The incident took place in booth number 259 in Kandihi village.

The clash erupted following the reluctance of a few voters to leave their cellphone behind before entering a booth. A few phones deposited with the personnel dropped to the ground triggering a quarrel.

This is the first instance of central forces pulling the trigger in the four phases of polling in Bengal.

Polling was held up for about 90 minutes after the incident. Will donate $1 to an environmental charity in India for every upvote and a BJP loss. So my colleagues were discussing this today. Even though I didn't want to be part of thier talk, they kept on bugging me and asking if I'm gonna vote modizee. I said ""I will vote for the guy who actually did some work for my constituency.

I had to get a slip written out and the dude straight up told me to vote for them.

I said no. My dilemma this time around is this. Candidates from both the major parties in my constituency are absolutely horrible (corruption, criminal cases, ties to the land mafia, the works). While I do support one party's ideology over the other's, I cannot bring myself to vote for their candidate in good conscience. 

So, given that my vote will essentially be a protest vote against the parties' choice of candidates, would you suggest I opt for NOTA or choose a random independent with a decent education and no criminal background based on their affidavit. So an ultra right conservative politician Raj Thackeray is spending all his energies in convincing people to vote against BJP-Shivsena. 

But liberals like Yogendra Yadav can't bring themselves to vote for the lesser evil (and quite a bit lesser evil at that in my opinion). He can go fuck himself.

Looks like its going to be BJP again in power irrespective of who you vote for. 

 

>While reports of non-functional EVMs leading to a delay in voting have come in from several places in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, Assam, Manipur, West Bengal, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, most media reports particularly highlighted glitches like the choice of buttons for some parties either missing from the EVMs or not working, or on pressing any one of the choices, **the vote registered on the VVPAT was recording it under the BJP’s election symbol.**

THIS.

>From Assam’s Tezpur parliamentary constituency and Meghalaya’s Shillong constituency came some of the first reports of **voters alleging that their votes were going to the BJP even if they hit the button for another candidate.** 

Further proof for the above reports

>However, a similar voter complaint was reported from a polling booth in Meerut too with a video as evidence, leaving election officials trying to resolve the problem. The *Times of India*[said](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjO3e_fjMjhAhUCKewKHQ4tA-cQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Fcity%2Fmeerut%2Ffurore-in-meerut-after-voter-presses-bsp-on-evm-vote-goes-to-bjp%2Farticleshow%2F61758614.cms&usg=AOvVaw0QYYLmlUShz6pxwgMrZ7WL), “Although officials replaced the ‘faulty’ machine, claiming it was a ‘malfunction’, non-BJP parties alleged that machines had been tampered with.”  
Later, BSP leader Satish Mishra told reporters, “We have registered complaint with the Election Commission and have sent them a video clip of the EVM, in which it is seen that the ‘elephant’ symbol is being pressed but the vote is going to the BJP’s ‘lotus symbol’. Our people had complained against it but no action was taken.”

&#x200B;

Had it not been for the VVPATs, we would have not known the situation. This is fucking serious. It is like these are rigged. No wonder all the parties were against EVMs in the first place. Also, they wanted 50% of all the polling booths to have VVPATs but instead got 5 per constituency. A friend in Delhi said that he will vote for BJP simply because he felt that AAP despite getting 67 seats in Vidhan Sabha, couldn't do anything because they got complete opposition from center govt.

So he feels that its better if you select folks from the party which is bound to win in Central elections.

Does anyone have any points against the above argument ? Contrary to the noise being made in the social media about modi winning again, I feel there is a very decent chance that NDA won't return to power. There is not much Modi wave in Mumbai. Most people are tired of his blabbering and feel that he has under-delivered. Lets hope it turns out well on May 23. I posted this somewhere else too but its a f\* dilemma 

&#x200B;

 I have a choice between 3 time MP from BJP vs a weak contestant from Congress. Other parties don't even stand anywhere. BJP Candidate is a good choice but in a wrong party. I still feel like voting for Congress just to ensure these idiots dont get a majority and do whatever they want to. My vote to Congress wont make Rahul a PM but still BJP needs to be harnessed by the NDA. They were just brutal in last 5 years. They could have done wonders but they misused their majority. I feel, maybe you people might have better views. Modi is not making these statements on Rajiv Gandhi out of frustration or something.

He is doing it as a strategy. The same strategy that Donald Trump uses. Say something so controversial that whole focus shifts on that. Your supporters are not leaving you. The confused voters are diverted from real issues. Got marked in both index fingers for assisting a differently abled. The people, United, Will never be defeated.

> * I want to tell the first-time voters: can your first vote be dedicated to the 'veer jawans',  and Can your first vote be dedicated to the 'veer shaheed' of Pulwama?

> * India has stopped the policy of getting scared of Pakistan's threats. Every other day they used to say we have nuclear button, we have nuclear button. What do we have then? Have we kept it for Diwali?

> * ... the Congress used a microscope to find a seat where the country’s majority is in a minority

> * In the past five years, no terrorist attacks have taken place. It has shrunk to a few parts of Jammu and Kashmir. In Pulwama, they killed 40 of our jawans. After the attack, around 42 terrorists have been eliminated in Pulwama. This is our working style. For a prosperous India, security is important.

> * Modi was ready with 12 missiles. It would have been a serious situation so it was good that Pakistan announced to return the Indian pilot else it would have been 'qatal ki raat'

Hi quick question: i applied for voter card few days back, got it approved and epic number has been assigned. How can i check the electoral roll, if i am allowed to vote or not.


Update: I checked few mins back, i can see my details now. Guys, quick questions before voting tomorrow. 

What is the best time to go for voting? Also, do you necessarily need the Voters slip to vote? 
I’ll be using my passport as ID proof, that wouldn’t be an issue, right? You can read about the MP from your/other constituency on sites like https://www.prsindia.org/mptrack  or myneta.info Being a first time voter, what should you look for before deciding who to elect? Should one decide his/her vote by looking at the candidates from his constituency or the party/pm one wants to see ruling the central government? Has anyone here who filled form 6A got a chance to vote this time?
P.S: Form 6A is for overseas elector registration. Is there any party who is in favor of Crypto Regulation? Did you guys see Raj Thackeray's latest speech. 1 hour standup act with audio visuals taking on Modi. Raj calls modi feku, hitler and wait for it GATECRASHER (nawaz sharif meeting). If you are anti modi this is a must see video.
https://youtu.be/NN1GyNmkJOc What are the chances of 56"" chest wala candidate winning the elections? I'm kinda scared for our democracy looking at what has happened with the centre in past 5 years. All I see around me are pure bhakts, be it my friends / relatives. Scary stuff.. smh... ×_× [deleted] all of our votes rest on the assumption that evms will work as intended, call me paranoid, but i am bit skeptical about them. especially given the fact that the total voting percentage give by eci is taking days to be annouced. there was a segment from ravish last night which highlighted this aspect. also reports of vvpats not matching or machines only voting for a party are not substantially cleared. All things considered, But I don't get the logic behind removing ""Go Vote"" threads. I guess encouraging people to vote that too in social media platforms should be appreciated and since this subreddit is one of the most followed in India, so, The people should be encouraged to vote to whoever they want but the irony is that you are posting threads like this that ""Go Vote"" threads will be blocked.  


Can you pl give me one logical argument behind this?  


If you think that people will use it for political campaigning then you can remove those submissions that are promoting any party or leader but what is wrong in encouraging people to vote. A stupid doubt but forgive my ignorance, should I be placing two votes in upcoming elections - state and general? BJP voters are clicking photos with EVM inside. Is this election fixed?

Who's winning from Begusarai? We’re two Americans who recently visited India for the first and second time, respectively. Our friend Aditya invited us to his home in the city of Patna in the state of Bihar where his dad, Ravi Shankar Prasad, is running for the Lok Sabha for the BJP. We visited his house and he showed us around his town, and we learned a lot about what Indian democracy looks like. We also got a chance to speak with some muslim women who were fighting for equal rights, and to visit an ""untouchable"" ghetto and orphanage. For us, this was an amazing opportunity to understand India a little more and learn about a political system that's very different than our own. In this video, we comment about some of our impressions on the noticeable differences between an Indian Lok Sabha  election and the elections we are familiar with in the United States. That said, we don't know a lot about the specific politics of the BJP or Aditya's dad and understand that they may be controversial to some people. We are not making any particular political statements or endorsements, but we were very grateful to our friend to show us the campaign that he is working on and the issues that are important to him at this time.

This thought has been on my mind for a few years, especially considering the fact that I'm not able to look after myself in the first place! i am depressed as fuck. i made this account as a throwWay but am so lazy that i use it now to interact on reddit.

i feel i am just coasting from day to day with no aim, goals or desires. felt shitty last night after plans got cancelled. snuck out of home and went to marine drive. I also smoked my first cigarette. i don't know why i did it, I always found smoking disgusting. but I wasn't thinking straight and I'm afraid to say I loved the buzz i got. a nicotine addiction is the last thing I need right now, i don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life Have finally decided to emotionally let go of a best friend of several years. Dude ghosted me and it filled me with anxiety about being absolutely unlikeable, considering I'm (25F) the quiet one who finds it hard to easily make friends and he's (24M) the popular one who gets along with everybody. We graduated from college, went our separate ways, but still kept in touch, except conversations started becoming heavily one sided. While I'm flattered that he finds me a safe space to talk about his fears and embarrassments, I'm more than a dumping ground, and he hadn't been acknowledging that for a couple of years. I suggested therapy, because his fears are negatively impacting the way he functions, he refused. I suggested talking to the girl he likes and is chewing my ears out talking about her for months, he said no. I finally put up boundaries, telling him it's getting too much for me at this point (at several moments, until I became explicit about it), he ghosted me altogether and stopped replying to texts I sent the days after. It's been a month. Time to let go for good now. It hurts, but it seems like a lost cause. I genuinely care about him as a friend, but holy shit, it's such entitled behaviour from him, considering he's a postgrad in psych and knows my mental health isn't the best either. Just broke up a serious relationship. Please help Can't really stop reminiscing about the past stuffs. Even the mediocre times have turned into something incredible in my memories. But everytime something something similar from the past repeats in the present time ,  the anxiety kicks in. Yeah sure 8th grade was really fun but no way I wanna live through something similar to those anxious and lonely times again Struggling with low self esteem since forever. Jo confidence at all. Single since looong. Getting to the age where people say I should get married. But I don't even earn much! My therapist suggested to me to watch my breathing mindfully numerous times a day which I haven't been able to do. It is especially difficult to do at work where you can't focus well. Secondly, as soon as I had to do it numerous times a day it became a chore.

Do any of you practice mindfulness? What do you do? What has been your experience? I  am a cannabis advocate and support legalization. I know that this is a very serious issue and I do not wish to spam/troll. I just want to point  out that a recent study linked legalization to a drop in suicide rates.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232164/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232164/)

It is not conclusive and more research is required. But that cannot happen without legalization in India. Hence r/GanjaMarch https://scroll.in/video/930337/watch-from-india-the-amazing-story-of-how-a-dog-with-skin-like-cracked-stone-was-revived Is there something wrong with me if I bring work home or try to get some things done at home? I do utilize by 8 hours fairly well but I can definitely be more focused at work. The reason I am saying this is because my health is not well. And it is not getting any better. If I bring work home or work more than I should then it is definitely good but takes a toll on health.

On the other hand, if I don't bring work home then I will probably end up watching TV which is worse than bringing work to home. Maybe I could do something else like study something different so that I don't get lonely post work. I'm posting a bit late but here goes nothing I just want to rant. 
I recently graduated and shifted back home to look for a job. I've been at home for almost 3 months now and I've become very thin with my patience with my family. I love them, but I can't be around them. In the past few months I have had close to zero interaction with my friends, I didn't really have many in my hometown to begin with. My family is a bit cloying, they do not appreciate personal space and I've grown up like that and have learned to live with it. I'm a woman and although there's no particular severe and honestly they care about my career a lot, there's just these things which I care about that I can't do here which I will be able to do once I am out of the city, out of their restrictions. But the time period, staying indoors almost all the time, talking in whispers to my boyfriend when I can't even let it hint that I have a love life, has taken a toll on my mental health and I have started feeling guilty about things that I normally wouldn't have. I am on the verge of tears when I type this. 
I feel guilty for having a boyfriend, having friends that I can normally talk to, for moving out of my house. I wouldn't feel guilty for these things before, but now I do? And it's making me irritable, annoyed, and I snap at my family more than usual. I don't feel calm or happy with myself and I don't have the patience to understand what my family does. I am moving out in a few days and my family is supportive. 
My living arrangements for moving out were arranged with the help of my family and a relative, but I still insisted that I take a look at the flat anyway and I am traveling there. Is that bad? Is that a bad impression on the relative who took a look at the flat? My family owes him a for that, he's really nice. But I feel obliged to not live in a flat unless I personally check it off. 
I don't know, these are petty problems and I'm bound to say they're petty in retrospect later but I just felt like a rant. Feeling depressed and suicidal for 2 days, I struggle with depression for about 4 years. Antidepressants helps manage it a lot. Recently I got married and my wife insisted I stop taking meds because she doesn't think it's a real thing and my dependence on pills is just make believe. I decided to give it a try. Things have been fine until two days back when I had little fight with her and I slipped into this state. I know little fights are inevitable in marriage but without pills I am vulnerable to depression when conflict happens. 

I am not able to openly discuss about how I feel and how conflicts affect me with her. Because she translates such discussion to ""she is the problem in all this"" and suggests breaking up. She does not understand that will only make it worse as I love her absolutely and she does to me. Only thing I want is if she can empathize more with my condition instead of taking it personally.",Reddiquette,2019-07-14 11:32:35

I think we need to acknowledge our mental health more. A lot of people don’t pay attention to their mental health and over time it becomes a part of them, and that’s when it’s hard to go back and start over. So, take care yourself physically and MENTALLY! I should be thanking reddit as it was a precursor to my recovery. I joined it last year. And it was in one of these threads I vented about my mental health. I did it twice and  the response turned out to be life-changing. Internet has some power and I got some relief that my concerns were legitimate. When people on internet are ready to listen to your story it gives you inner satisfaction which you can't even get from your friends and family.

Went for therapy (2 sessions). Got out of toxic friendships. Stayed mostly on my own, made new friends. Tried new hobbies, started reading books again (I hadn't read any in past four years). Earlier whenever I used to talk about my story, I would start crying. Now I don't feel like it. 

Depression does some real damage to your brain. It caused me epilepsy and my parents thought it was due to my studying habits. Not all parents or friends are good. Some people are inherently good (you'll be lucky if you happen to find one), some are inherently bad and some are in-between and they are the worst kind. This society has made us believe that other's approval is far more important than our own. Add social media, career, relationship, looks and the concoction would be enough to cause anyone some amount of injury to mental and emotional health. 

I see my friends venting about how their lives are unfair. I can give them sympathy and offer some solutions. But it is up to them to come out of this pain. 

Life is short, really short. You don't know when you're going through a good phase of your life. And life is strange too. It makes us confuse our priorities. When there's some health issue our lives get even more complicated. Not all people can afford therapy or cut people from their lives (kyuki circumstances). Time cannot heal your wounds. You have to heal it on your own. 

One thing I did a lot was writing everything about my life. Keeping your thoughts to yourself causes more injury. If you feel like you'll be judged or something, type it down and don't read it. Write about every single event that embarrassed you, angered you. One can't keep on adding water to the already full cup. You will have to empty it out at one point. I'm trying to escape from my partially emotional abusive dad, by staying in a PG near work. I've told my Mom about my intention, she's still processing it. I've given the false reason that there's a lot of workload and commute time, but actually I don't feel comfortable at home. It feels like I'm walking on eggshells. After a recent confrontation where I told I'm depressed, I don't talk to my dad much, so the outburst and abuse towards me has reduced now.  I want to feel free, and achieve my dreams.  Are there any repercussions to be scared of? I don't feel motivated to do anything. I masturbate almost every 2 hours. I sleep most of the time. It's like I'm already dead.

Life seems like slavery. Introvert. Fell for a girl in +2 five years back. Thought she'd be the one I would share everything with. All this without even talking to her. When I finally did, got rejected. Been depressed ever since. Used to cry a lot during my UG 1st year. Food was the only thing that used to make me happy. Started eating outside almost everyday. Luckily got a good job amid all these. Thought things will change.

But, Got diagnosed with IBS( Irritable bowel syndrome) last year,  Vit D and B12 deficiency this year. Got a minor surgery done recently. Spent almost 1L on hospitals in 8 months. 

Don't have anyone to share my feelings. Still cry very often. Just living one day at a time, hoping things will get better. I literally have 0 friends. I have no place to vent. I feel so damn alone. Spoke to one of my old school friends last night. He's been pretty depressed lately. He had to end a five year old relationship because his parents are completely against intercaste marriage. He's a Jatt Hindu and the girl a Jatt sikh. Imagine.

He had a pretty bad fight with his parents. His mom threw a pretty bad tantrum and cried a lot saying crappy stuff about the girl and how his life is getting barbaad. He asked them to stop saying all this, it's not like he has cancer but according to his mother, isse acha to cancer he hta.

I am shocked and can't stop thinking about how fucked up Indians are. Im bipolar. Had my first full blown psychotic episode in my late teenage. Its been years the psychosis is gone, but still feel as if i havn't recovered from it. All that is left is long periods of depression, nihilism and self pity. I think, my two+ year long so called depression phase has come to an end. When you hit rock bottom, everything seems unfair, but it's not. I used to sit numb all day in my hostel looking at the ceiling and what not. Your perspective changes a lot during times like those. And now, sometimes, it gets difficult meeting new people and unwillingly telling them about your ""hard times"", but it's ok. I know people have it real bad. I just want to say, flashbacks will never end. You have to deal with it. Meanwhile, trying to focus on the present and forget about the past. Let's see how it goes. I messed up CSE prelims yesterday. For the second time. I had put in so much effort for last one and a half year. All in vain.

  


I always wanted to pursue civil services. My interests were always in resonance with what it needs to prepare for CSE. I had quit IT service sector job for this. Gave it all I could with my hard work. But now, I can't help but feel incapable. I have lost my confidence, I have lost my enthusiasm to learn, I am afraid what future beholds.

One thing I am blessed with is people around me. They have always supported me. But it hurts a tad bit more to let down people who were by your side, every single time.

  


I hope I feel better in a few days, but right now I feel down and out. I will be seeing a therapist towards end of June. Been planning it for almost an year now.

Right now I'm going through super stressful times career wise, what are small habits/changes that helped you sustain for a week or two without breaking down?( When you're literally on the edge) How is social anxiety seen in India? I'm in 12th. Mom has stage 4 cancer  spread to brain, lungs, abdomen, stomach and some more places. I didn't start a project which I was supposed to 15 days ago, since my mom had severe stomach bleeding and stayed in hospital for 15 days. How should I keep my mental health safe in the long run? [Rant, not so serious] 

I am so done with this country. My mother is a pseudo-modern person. She will call me boring or that I have a really bad fashion sense, etc. I just like wearing plain clothes, jeans with a t-shirt, you know, casual stuff. She hates that I don't wear 'modern' clothes. Well, I would if I had a chance to because I don't really have time to dress up and enjoy. That's fine, I liked the fact that my mom at least doesn't jab about someone wearing something revealing or whatever. I was wrong. Dead wrong. There were some WhatsApp posts where pictures of girls in normal shorts and tank tops are being circulated, the crime was their bra was quite visible (back or straps), she started laughing and it went like this-

""Will you wear this!? Why even bother wearing something, they should just step out wearing the bra"".

I was shocked. MY mom said this. The one who calls me plain and boring for wearing Jeans and t-shirts. 

I argued with her, ""What's wrong with that? Why aren't you shaming the people who took the picture without any permission and circulating pictures for wearing clothes totally reasonable for weather like 37°C?""

Mom : ""She didn't reach a level to wear such clothes. What has she done in her life to wear it? ""

Me : ""Why does one have to prove something to wear clothes according to comfort? One should wear anything he/she wants to. Maybe that's why other countries are more developed. They don't hold such views""

Mom : ""You first bring better marks then talk. That's the only thing you are good at, arguing. That's all you can do. Become something first, then speak. You can't prove anything"".

Does someone's opinion only matter when they have a so-called respected profession or are the topper of a school? My mother is someone I love, especially because my father is an alcoholic. Now I'm questioning everything. Is my mother actually the person I think I know? I used to let the snide remarks go, ""As if you'll become the best in XYZ activity"", then she'll claim that she never said anything like that. She has been through a lot, because of my father and her in-laws. I always thought she was the nicest person I ever knew. Now I can see black streaks of Islamophobia and hypocrisy in what I thought was a golden canvas. When I think about it, my mother has never apologized for anything she has ever done wrong, ever.

Keep in mind she made me wear a dress which was totally backless, till the end. The visibility of bra apparently changes everything. She'll also remark about how I don't have enough confidence to wear that dress maybe I shouldn't have tried it out, after all. She'll pest me for not having a boyfriend and then shame any girl who hangs out with guys. She'll shame my sister's boyfriend for not being successful (He has a job in finance department, he doesn't make a lot but he has just started earning and treats my sister with respect and love, unlike my father). My mother would rather be with my alcoholic father than a loving person who is not as financially stable.

My mother is one of them. The society. I'm going no where in my career. My only option is to go for higher studies and choose any low tier college or develop any skills. I also have no friends in real life so I dont go out much. I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I am 23 and I recently completed my engineering from one of the premier institutes of the country. I got a decently paying IT job in an MNC. But I have no idea what I am going to do with my life. Existential crisis toh zindagi ka saathi bann chuka hai. Sex mei utna interest nahi but pyaar chahiye, vo toh milne se raha. Naa koi passion hai life mei. Bus jo aa raha hai vo kar raha hu. I'm not facing any mental problems per se but the thoughts that I'm mediocre, not good enough etc etc keep coming up on an hourly basis. Parents are supportive but they want me to follow the traditional beaten path of engineering, job, Masters in US/MBA in India, job, marriage, bachche etc. Kisi cheez mei extremely talented bhi nahi hu. Pata nahi kya hoga kaise hoga. Zinda hu bus. I have wasted my life and I didn't know how to improve it. Was doing pretty poorly as it is, but now college CG (ie grade and all) came out for the sem and it was atrocious. D's everywhere, I'm useless 18M, I'm having huge mood swings. Yesterday I studied for over 6 hours, including the class 12 project and today none, I didn't even write a word. Not just with academics, some days I love going out with friends, and then nothing. I don't even use social media on those days. I smoke too, it rises way too much on such days. One week I go for a jog or run everyday, then the next week none. I read a lot, somedays 100 pages, somedays none, and same thing for movies or TV shows. Some days I wake up till 3 or sleep too early. And these cycles have been occurring since the beginning of Class 11. These are not long lasting, 2-3 days to a week. I am a great student, but I'm called lazy in class, but I'm not lazy, I don't even do the things I love doing. Last year, Class 11 finals, I got almost full in Accounts and Economics. But really fucked up in English, Commerce and Maths. I don't understand. I'm not really depressed. I don't know. I don't have someone to talk to about this. Anybody feel this? 27 and still struggling. Have a appointment with psychologist on evening. Trying to make some money in parallel to service loans and paying for therapies. The ambiguity in freelancing is killing me as well. Want to get back to a day job, but have zero confidence. 17, screwed up all entrance exams even though I'm good in studies. Can't find the motivation to study for any entrances, seeing my parents disappointed makes me depressed. I have no idea what to do now that I'm out of school, future doesn't seem too bright. Sometimes, I wish I had joined those coaching centers for entrances when I had the chance to. [deleted] I would lile to ask why people are more depressed theses days? Can someone shed light on how different was environment(mentlaly) in the 80's or 90's Does anyone know a decent therapist in dehradun.....i can't seem to find one. Completed engineering in 2016, got a off campus job in 2017, quit it last month because I was bored of the profile and Ghar wale and I also want govt. job. So preparing for some, i have improved a lot.
But, I have a constant fear of not being able to live independently. Father has type2diabetes. Worried for him because we don't have much financial strength if anything happens. all these makes me more motivated to prepare well. Ghar me har din kich kich chalta h mom dad ka, I get frustrated with them. 20, have good grades but no one to support, barely had any friends and the ones I had, left. My parents don't care and are just selfish, never got any support by parents and friends in doing anything. Had no one ever tell that they loved and cared about me. Trying to starve myself till all the pain is gone. Every time I try my fucking best get out of a new low, my state just gets lower than what I can't even imagine. There has to be a limit. I don't know who I am anymore. And how long is anyone going to keep supporting you every time? They'll get tired too sometimes. And a little regret is not being able to be there at least for the 2 people who helped me out, cause I don't know how to.

All I can remember and sometimes regret is the ""chances"" I had and didn't succeed. 
Now, every morning is filled with dissociation. Cannot control my anger. Help I have screwed up many things in my life but I am doing well as of now. I am 31 and I have a decent job and a bright future.

I have been facing existential dilemma where I am not happy with anything and I am not sure how to live my life. I do my job well, I travel quiet a bit, I live in a good rented flat by myself, etc. If I dedicate my life to more work then I end up being more stressed but I do want to work more. If I just sit and watch movies or tv shows then that would also make me stressed. How much traveling or shopping can one do? It all feels very meaningless and I am unable to spend my time with myself being content and enjoying what I have.

This stress is affecting my life very much as far as my health is concerned. I have high BP, feels depressed, extremely low libido, suffering from obesity, and food addiction, etc.",Reddiquette,2019-06-02 11:25:36

We are limiting ourselves to publicly available short stories by Indian authors.

For those who aren't familiar, Dhanpat Rai Shrivastava, who wrote under the pen-name of [Munshi Premchand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premchand), was a prolific - and popular - writer of short stories in Hindi, in the early 1900s. 

This story is interesting for many reasons - 'Qazzaqi' means outlaw, although in the story, the qazzaqi in question is a mail-carrier. Premchand's acute understanding of poverty and class is very apparent from this story of the friendship between a the qazzaqi and a young child. 

The rules are simple - read the story and tell us what you thought about it in the comments.

Happy to answer any questions! I'm 22. Unemployed right now. Did Engineering from a good private college. Made few friends in college, drank, smoked, movies, music. Fuck didn't learn a thing from college, why did I choose computer science engineering. Think I need 5-6 months more to get skills and get a developer job. Can I do it ? I don't know but I'll try my best. If failed, I don't know. These 6 months are crucial. I want my life to be changed until I hit 25 mark. No killing myself thoughts, no crying at night, no lying to my parents about how ""good"" I feel. Hope times will change. How to deal with people who mean well to me, but their advice is always /r/wowthanksimcured material How do I deal with Loneliness. I feel alone even when surrounded by family or a class of 70 people. It's like a crisis. I feel like there's no one who understands me.  Has anyone stopped using social media like Instagram or any other?? How has life changed after that? 
18F here, I get depressed when I see other's posts on Instagram. I don't compare myself but there are certain times where I get depressed seeing how other's live their life. Twitter was good, until it all flooded with bloody politics, shitposting everywhere! 
Should I quit using Instagram/FB?  Loneliness. I don't feel like I belong to any group. I start feeling uncomfortable after a few days, mostly because I don't talk much. I have got this sort-of-permanent group of friends though, which I'm ashamed of cause they are just a bunch of nashedis and poor guys. My girlfriend is clinically depressed. She gets really anxious and sad often. Being a single daughter, her parents have very high expectations from her. She studies really hard but has breakdowns often and whatever she studies goes down the drain as she loses focus and ends up sobbing for days. She has bucket loads of medicines and I have accompanied her to psychiatrist couple of times. I remind her about medicines. 

Other than this I don't know what I can do to help her. It is painful to see her crying and telling me that I should move on and she isn't the right person for me. I wish to help her somehow. What little things I can do to make her feel better? 
 I've recently dropped CA to pursue MBA. I see all my friends getting through the exams I struggled a lot and eventually quit. I used to be quite good at studies. I secured top 3 position throughout school and even scored quite high in other olympiads. But as of now, I'm just completely devastated. My parents are quite disappointed with me. I'm preparing for my CAT exam but I just never feel any confidence. I used to be quite confident for my exams. Now it feels as if I'm just a complete failure. I've came so close to committing suicide but backed off because of my family. I can't hurt them. They don't deserve it. My insecurities have shot through the roof. I don't feel like talking to anybody. Sleeping at night has become impossible. I've secretly started taking sleeping pills to help me sleep. My girlfriend is soich supportive and so is my sister, but I feel like I just can't do anything. Tried watching motivational videos but it didn't help me. Suicide has become like the backup to fall to if everything else fails. I'm walking on a very thin line but I try to keep my head straight even though sometimes it feels just useless.  I had this female friend i loved the most (not as a gf or something, but she made me feel like I had a sister). We met in 10th. It wasn't attraction or something, we just started talking randomly as we were in a group project and we both really thought each other to be ""important"". Atleast I did. Now time passes by, and I learn more about her, about her boyfriend, ex etc etc. Now starts the big deal, I see her online on Instagram every once in a while, updating pfps, uploading stories etc but not a DM from her side, even when I'm the first to initiate. After some time of her breakup, she had another relationship which I didn't agree upon but still said to give it a go if she feels alright. Now she breaks up with this dude too after literally ignoring me for 2-3 months. I celebrated rakshabandhan with her. Now she starts talking to me again saying that I missed you and other shit. She's not even come to play Holi with me and even denied coming out of her house to meet me. The reason I'm hurt in this case is due to actually trusting someone as a close friend with whom I can share my sorrows and my happiness with. And I didn't care about making a single other female friend during this time who was this close. I have quite a more female friends whom I can talk to like 1-2 hours on call but I'm too afraid to get close to anyone.

To amplify the situation, my best friend who was with me from 5-7+ years stabbed me in the back. Last year, I helped him so much as to listening to other people's abuses for him. This time, because I've been a little emotional and hurt, he started treating me worse. He'd use me for his work and not even talk again. He's had new friends who spend money on him, who can bring their own vehicles for him to avoid walking etc. This friend of mine is lost too. We used to go around for morning rides sometime ago. Now they don't even invite me to some evening party. I'm lost. Idk what to do.

To amplify it further, it's JEE mains on 10th. I hadn't studied because the day I got free from boards, I started coding. I learnt python (some regex and oop remaining) and planning to learn graphic designing, 3d modelling and game design by Unity, ethical hacking, kotlin, php, html5, css, web development in general, social marketing and growth development in the holidays following. But I ain't interested a shit in JEE and it now hits me hard. I'm just too upset and empty over my situation and don't know what to do now.

EDIT: Plus I'm overweight (72kgs at 5'8 only 18y/o). I'm a pretty attractive guy, but the extra weight fucks up my looks. I wear glasses with high negative number. Maybe people don't talk to me because I look ugly too. I'm an intern now. Finished MBBS earlier this year. Coming to internship I realised I don't want to pursue medicine any further. Absolutely fucking disgusted by the slave treatment I'm getting. 60 hour duties. 5k/month pay. Only once a month leave. And hardly learning any clinical skills. All we're made to do is documentation and ward boy work. I hate it here. I think of dying everyday. I don't even get to go home. Worse that I get calls even after duty hours. Fuck this profession. I hope everyone just dies. 

Edit - Should have just done engineering written gre and gone abroad. 

Is there any related career option I can take up that pays well and doens't make me a slave. My attitude has changed a lot toward a person. I kinda have started disliking. Got a bit angry kinda lately. 

Hbu? I’ve recently developed anxiety and panic attacks mostly caused by agoraphobia. I’ve approached psychiatrist in India who recommended CBT. When I mentioned I live outside India, he recommended to get CBT anywhere and prescribed Benzos. He also mentioned what I have is anticipatory anxiety and can be cured only by desensitisation. This has completely taken over my life to an extent I might loose job and family. 

Does someone have experience in this? If you beat it, how did you do it?  I’m in my early 30’s unmarried, staying with my single father. Lately I’m feeling stuck in my life, personally and professionally. I can’t do anything because I’m stuck in a small city and with household chores that I do for my father. Communication with my father is also passive aggressive. I know he wants and wishes good for me. But still there is alway some kind some discomfort and passive aggression between us. I have stagnated professionally because I can’t do much in the small city. I want to move out of this city. Improve my personal life, have more friends, be more successful. But I can’t do any of it because I feel I have to take care of my father as he’s alone. But now it’s all taking a toll on me in every way. I can’t expect anything from my other family members as they are assholes.
 [removed] Laid off, yup, they gave me money for survive for couple of months..But most scary experience is sitting at home and having no goal for the day...Yeah, i am searching jobs ..But got experience like 14 years in embedded does not leave you many places in industry...Let's see Being an introvert , I'm always away from my team mates. Many times I get vibes that my colleagues are talking behind my back ( unsure ) . 
I'm comfortable only with few people's.  Having issues with self expression due to my constant overthinking. There's an entire world in me that I find interesting enough to think that I would love to share, but my insecurities get to me and probably stop me from being the best version I can be.
Tried a couple of sessions of therapy, but found it to be too mechanic. Can anyone suggest a good therapist that's located in Bangalore? I still am trying to keep an open mind about it.
Take care everyone. Enjoy your time. 

PS. I've already gone through the ICall list of therapists that keeps floating around here.  [deleted] My father who has been my superman, is starting to forget things. I want to take him to a doctor, but he is adamant as hell that there is nothing wrong with him. Currently at an impasse I feel sad 

Very very sad for no reason.

I find no purpose and I am lazy. Hi all Incelistanese.

Last words Last week. This is the second time I postponed.

i'm a sub 8 curry which translates to being an incel, because being curry gives me -3 points SMV.

Also STEMcel, 5'7 heightcel and most importantly MentalCel (Schizo). I had psychosis twice like I saw glitches in the matrix where my thoughts were like public info. The universe is a lie. Got locked up, Tried meds, killed libido and still felt like shit, so dropped.

I had a betabuxmaxxing upbringing where gymceling was prohibited for studymaxxing. Wondered was I a pensionfund for people who introduced me because no social security in third world? I think my parents had good intentions but some wrong judgements because they had it worse in a previous era.

I missed out on Teen love because I went to a shitty boys school in curry land where bullying has ruined me forever. What I learnt beyond all the virtue signallings and moralizings is that - good? bad? Doesn't matter, Just don't be ugly. The Universe is Amoral where the good doesn't necessarily outweigh the bad. Fuck you to those who think No Women meant paradise.

the west is on top economically and militarily because they discovered two entire continents which they genocided using biological warfare (unintentionally?) with min effort and used the proceeds for further colonisations. Human mind is most creative when destruction is the goals - explains how most innovations and funding go to the defence industry first.

Muslims are worse because they are more violent bullies but dont have the means/tech to dominate. Prolly why women love them. Also they're not freedom loving - They don't let their women create good porn or wear clothes for me to fap to so fuck them. Only Istanbul and Morocco had nice hoes.

I moved to the west, to latin america and it was like literally moving outside a prison of poor uggos. My type is Latinas from Colombia and Venezuela and French speaking Beurettes, cause they are fit and more easy versions of the stuck up upper class women in bollywood paradise.

After saving money and little inheritance, ever since 21 I've been with 3 prostitutes a month avg. I'm reaching 25 now, Money's over. To those who say sex is nothing, they're lying. Out of all places I've travelled, I recommend Montreal. Hoes are affordable and friendly due to competition among femoids. Femoids are attractive yet friendly like some weird outlier.

I'm also a VISAcel now, I got kicked out of one of the western countries where buying hoes was illegal, now I can't go back.

After having been with stacy pros of every/mixed race, I don't want to be betabux to a washed up curry looksmatch in legalized prostitution - aka arranged marriage. Prostitution for the same quality of women is more expensive in curryland. I was born to loose because I'm not getting a virgin supermodel with a phd anyway.

My Patrick Bateman days are over. I don't look forward to wage slaving to corporate anymore especially for peanut outsourced wages in return for shit quality of life. Can't NEETbux cause not in first world and not a potential syrian rapefugee.

I wanted to get drugs, but fuck it I don't know how and now I'm grounded to live with parents so can't get it. Should have had it when I was offered it while in the west. Regrets. I also regret all the time I spent studying for nothing doesn't matter how much good I was at it. Why contribute to Society where you are at the bottom of the hierarchy ?

Video games don't appeal to my anymore. I realized life is a video game too and I need to turn it off.

True freedom and equality is in death because the soul is formless. #Philiosophicel

I got nitrogen cans and a cpap mask for painless death. I keep postponing the usage. I have just enough money for it. If it fails I'm using a rope. No Hope. No more Cope. Only Rope, then I'm Pope.

"Reading Group #1 - 'Delhi' by Vandana Singh (SFF, Lightspeed Magazine)",20,bpnh70,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpnh70/reading_group_1_delhi_by_vandana_singh_sff/,13,"We had earlier [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpaan5/are_you_interested_in_being_part_of_a_reading/) if people would be interested in having a reading group for Indian fiction. Since we got a good response, our first reading group story is: 
> 
> #'**Delhi' by Vandana Singh** 
(Lightspeed Magazine, 2016) [approx 7000 words] 

> Read the story here: http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/delhi/

This story, written in English, is about a man who can drift in and out of different periods of time. This temporal (i.e. time-related) travelling takes him through different historical periods of the city of Delhi, as it was under different emperors and rulers. 

For our first time with this reading group, I wanted to pick a story by one of my favourite speculative fiction authors from India - Vandana Singh. She was born and brought up in India, and she now teaches physics at an American university- though her stories, written in English and Hindi, are mostly science fiction and fantasy drawing from life in India. You can read more about her at her [website](http://vandana-writes.com/about-vandana/) or on Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandana_Singh). She recently published a short story collection called [Ambiguity Machines and Other Stories](https://zubaanbooks.com/shop/ambiguity-machines/) (Zubaan Books), but this story is from an earlier anthology of science fiction called '[So Long Been Dreaming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/847409.So_Long_Been_Dreaming)'.

The rules are simple - read the story and tell us what you thought about it in the comments. If you haven't read the story yet, I'd suggest you stay away from the comments as people's comments may contain spoilers! Please observe reddiquette - be polite and respectful. And thanks for participating - /u/doc_two_thirty and I are really happy to share our love for reading with you all.",madamplease," ""Tell me, Om Prakash, am I nothing but a strand in a web?"" 

I enjoyed this a lot. 

Often, when driving/being driven through cities, I visualize the same things. Interweaving timelines, the past and the future, everything happening on the streets happening in the now. I have never, ever read about it in a story. Thank you for picking this. I finished reading this and I wanted a bit more. I haven't been to Delhi and I felt that if I had been there, it would've added more colour to my understanding of this work of fiction. The author's description of the city and its connections with history with a subtle mix of science fiction is marvelous. I felt more description on the characters other the main one (Aseem) would've been better. Though this is a short story, it could've certainly included little more about how all the characters were intertwined in the story especially Aseem and the woman he was supposed to find. All in all, it was a little dark and slow story but was worth a read !!

PS: Thank you /u/madamplease for making this reading group happen. My first one here. Expecting many more of these to come !! Read the story a couple of hours back and had the time to dwell on it a little.

The ending felt a bit abrupt at first but now I think that the story was less about the mystery of time lines and alternate cities, and more about Aseem finding his purpose for life. At first when he is given the printout of the woman's face, he thinks that his purpose is to save her life but I think it was less about the woman and more about the information she carried, which eventually motivates Aseem into trying to prevent this ""immaculate city"" coming into fruition.

This was a really interesting read. I would like to know more about the dark future of the city. Author could turn this into a full fleshed out series, I will gladly buy it ( although I hope she adds a bit humor too.)

Much thanks to /u/madamplease for suggesting this and also for taking the initiative to form the group. Looking forward to the next one. :) An excellent read, enjoyed every bit of it. This is the first time I'm reading something by the author and it's very enjoyable.

Om prakash and his intimacy with the bees. A hive is like a city, and honey the fruits of labor. May be I am reading too much into the honeybees and the honey.

Enjoyed every second of it. Thank you /u/madamplease Seeing this quite late; glad more people are reading Vandana Singh. I didn't like it much. I couldn't care much about the protagonist (just realized I can't even remember if he was named.) (Edit: oh right, duh, Aseem)

The concept itself is neat, but it doesn't feel like a coherent beginning-middle-end story to me. Reads like someone riffing on a neat idea more than anything else.

For a much more pleb take on ""layers of history,"" one of the Rivers of London books does a really good bit where the protagonist literally peels off the histories of London travels back in time through them. That was a sidebar in a full length book. 

That's what 'Delhi' felt like to me. Could be great as a part of something bigger.

Stylistically, I dont really like the tense used, and the descriptions felt a little overwrought to me. It might play better with an audience that doesn't know anything about Delhi, but it felt a little overdone to me.

Then again, I'm not published in lightspeed (and not for lack of trying) so what do I know.",Reddiquette,2019-05-17 13:56:03
Does stuff actually sell on OLX?

If so, can you recommend appropriate subs to post to?",SnarlsChickens," Yeah definitely. I have never sold books but have sold a number of ps4 games. Yeah it does. I have sold my NEET prep books and they actually were sold at quite a bargain. Just be clear in the ad and be careful. Also, ULPT, post 2 or 3 ads more with different pics of the same books  by different accounts, but for a higher price so your chances of selling increase. Have you cleared FRM?

How are the placements? Wrt company type, country of work, package etc Which edition? if you are in Blr, can post in that monthly classifieds thread.  
also can sell at Blossoms bookstore. For books, I found Facebook Marketplace more effective than OLX. I have sold a laptop, my high school text books, a cooler but I tried selling my Game of Thrones books but without any success,",Reddiquette,2019-05-23 03:51:25
Relationships and Families: Advice Thread,65,9qvvpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9qvvpw/relationships_and_families_advice_thread/,351,"We are trying something new: a scheduled thread to talk about relationships and families. You can ask for advice, or talk about problems here. 

Remember [rediquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), and be kind to each other! This is a moderated thread. ",madamplease," I am not sure if this is the right place to ask, but my Indian neighbors just had a baby and I would like to send flowers or some sort of gift to celebrate their joy.  We live in America.  What would be most appropriate please?  And are there any flowers that should be avoided?  The child is a boy, and their firstborn. 

Thanks! How do I get in a relationship in the first place to take advice?

 Alright. Not sure if this is allowed but ill post anyways. I reside in Canada. I like this girl in my class (HS) and she is Indian. I want to ask her out but like most timid teenagers I'm afraid of rejection. I guess what I want to know is how Indian's feel about their daughter's dating an African. I know there are a lot of stereotypes plaguing Black Canadians, so it would make sense for Indian parents to be a little bit apprehensive about this.. Any advice of starting a better relationship with father when you are in adulthood. I live in Hyd and my family stays in Delhi. We talk regularly but the ususal stuff, nothing emotionally connecting.

&#x200B;

I feel my father had been depressed in his adult life and he escaped to alcoholism then. Things are better in that vertical but as for our relationship we just talk very minimal. I would definately it to be like as we really are friends and he is sharing stuff where we both are comfortable being vulnerable. 

&#x200B;

Anyone else devloped such relationship late in their lives? Dont be rebellious for the sake of it.  raise your hands if you live alone and are happy. A common advice for all the ones seeking help: don't put any relationship above your peace of mind.  Do you believe in life after love ? So my friend was always popular among girls but the 3 crushes he had didnt like him at all. So he was always a bit depressed. Also was jealous of me when i was in a ""relationship"" 4 years back. 

3 months ago he got his first gf and yesterday he lost his virginity to another girl. While he accepts he cheated, he says he will never leave his gf for anyone. 

Im not sure what i should feel. **Happy** for his progress in 3 months... **jealous** that he got laid before me [single after the break up and no girl even looks at me ever. dont even have a girl's number.]... or **sickened** that he just cheated on his gf he told me he will never hurt just 2 days ago he cheated on her [he said he will never tell her this... ]  If anyone here is planning to have children, please, for the love of god, make sure, or at least try your best, to not give your child a fucked up childhood. Although my mom made sure I grew up in a safe environment in terms of having a decent education, food, shelter etc., the lack of emotional connect with my dad, mom or brother has had severe repercussions in my life now (I am 26 years old). I am socially inept when it comes to family interactions. When I visit my friends' place and see their family do normal things like watch TV together or just go out for a stroll together, I cannot compute it. I am trying really hard to change how this affects me, but it's very difficult as my whole life I have been programmed to see my parents or family members as such roommates or people.

I cannot sit in a room with my family members and have a conversation because neither of us knows what we like or dislike. It just gets awkward and after a point just frustrating. All our conversations are like ""official"" things like, ""What work did you do today? (Earlier it was, did you do your homework)"", Or did you deposit the money in the bank etc.

When I realized how fucked up this was and tried fixing it from my end by showing some interest in their lives, it felt so fake. I still tried my best but the response from them was more of ""Get to the point"". Or ""Why are you asking all these things"".

Also, if you stop loving your partner, sort that shit out. I spent a good 15 to 17 years of my life just seeing my parents hate each other. In hindsight, I feel if they would have gotten a divorce it would have been much better because they literally don't talk to each other even when we were living in the same house. This I believe had a severe influence on how a relationship with a partner should be when I grew up and it keeps fucking things up.

I understand a good education and upbringing for a child is paramount, but please be there for the child.

EDIT: I am more or less functional with my friends because that's all I had growing up for getting any sort of emotional support. And by emotional support, I mean fundamental things like fun, or sports, or talking about problems etc. Edit: Thanks so much for your advice. I've removed the comment to protect privacy. Okay so there's this girl working in different department (same building, different floor)of my company


I want to ask her out but not sure how to approach without looking creepy or desperate.


Also there's no causual dating culture in my office, so that's not helping either


Any help regarding this issue? [removed] [deleted] ITT: Either we single or we friendzoned. And most definitely we ugly. 

Here's to better days in the future bhai log!

 So I met this girl 1 year ago at my cousin's wedding. She is my cousin's cousin . We exchanged numbers and we started talking/chatting. 
We were in different cities.we use to flirt with each other while calling/chatting. I proposed her 2 times but she always use to laugh it off or ignore. 

In this year I got admit from american university and she got a government job . Last month we met and she confessed that she likes me and wants to marry me. And she also told her mother about me . She also told me about her past and how she was in relationship with two guys at the same time . And how she was ""wild"" in her previous relationships. I told her that I don't have plans for marriage yet. I told one of my friends about her and he says that I should stay away from her. 

I am 25 yr ugly dude and I don't think I can get another girl to like me if I left her. Sometimes I think that she likes me too and sometimes I think that she is just using me as her parents were looking for groom from one year.
Nowdays she just talk about marriage and how she wants to marry before her 28th birthday. We both are 25 years old. I can't marry her as I have plans for MS and PhD. 
So what should I do ? Should I break up with her? 



 Constantly occupied with family and chores, but have no social life (read no girlfriend)..  [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] How can I stop my parents from getting on my nerves? 

I mean, if I'm heading out I get all sorts of questions thrown at my face. 

Where are you going? 

With whom?

Why? 

You went there last week already, why again? 

Is it important to go? 

How are you going? 

When will you be back? 

Just stupid unnecessary questions all the time. I'm 22M, advice?  [removed] That's a great idea. I feel a lot of family Dynamics in India are poles apart from the mostly Western community here. This will be a good place. Maybe call it r/IndianRelationshipAdvice or something [removed] Guys - Things will get complicated when a new female member enters the family, so the idea of a joint family is something you shouldn't even explore. Move out, find a small place before hitching. I feel like going to my Ex's house and screaming at her for cheating on me. I know it's wrong but I still have a strong urge. Suppose I like a girl and we're good friends, but say I want to take things further and want to be in a relationship with her, what hints would she give if she things likewise, other signals, or should I directly go for it, I'm afraid rejection would hamper our good friendship.  I have been an introvert all my life and I really enjoy it. For past few months I get this craving to talk to someone. I have this feeling of loneliness, like something is missing. I am not happy but I am not sad either.

I don't know if it is something normal or something is changing within me.Or may be I am a little overworked( or underworked maybe?) and/or lonely. 

Just to add, I have also become very anxious about things for past couple of years. Like covering up worst case scenario for every major thing in my life. I also have an insatiable hunger for success. No target, once achieved, brings any pleasure to me...

Maybe I am just over thinking and just need to take a break.. We are still young, and have been in a relationship for 7 months. I really love her. What are some signs that it is going to last? So here's the deal....

Which  is better, a second hand car or an expensive bike to go to college daily?  [removed] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEPGy0NIcEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEPGy0NIcEA) Hey guys, need advice on how to get any girl to approach. I look fairly mediocre(decent height(5'11"") and not fat(70kg) but slightly below avg. looks) and being in a college with 1:10 ratio of girls to boys(engg.) have made me really really inexperienced in talking to them. Tried tinder, and got a few matches, but none of them worked out to even a date. I can't hold a conversation with a girl, have even poorer sex ratio than my college at work, and basically zero female interaction in my life. 

There's a silver bullet and that's my top tier education and income, which will get me married fairly easily, but don't help in dating. Girls would rather date a stud who is a loser IRL than avg. looking successful guy. So, what to do?",Reddiquette,2018-10-24 10:49:29
"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",24,ai7392,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,17,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",fenocs," It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are ""spiritual""). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:

1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.

2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.

3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.

Btw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  ""Ramayan"" and ""Mahabharata"". I didn’t find what was the specific question though LOL, spiritual country my foot! Let me quote myself that I've written elsewhere, albeit bit edited. This was specific to issue of legalization of weed but, overall I think I got the point across.

>Society is a 'state' of being; it's neutral - not good not bad. There are some societies where individuals are more vibrant and there are those that are less. And unsurprisingly, all those societies that let/allow/ individuals to make those choices instead of gatekeeping like we do, have all legalized cannabis. And our society that does this gatekeeping  have unsurprisingly regressive, controlling and less vibrant.

>I'll tell you why that is.

>One of the national characters that define us is coddling people as if they are children. One of our national character is parents treating gross ass 30 year old man as still a child. This kind of thinking is pervasive.

>3. When to do with your sex organs.

>7. What to eat and what not to. And how morality is linked to what you eat
>8. What to say and what not to say. People like you (I mean analogous ) laid the foundation for 66/A and now you can get jailed for ""wrong speak"" on facebook.


>... if you aren't satisfied, I'll let the list go on. 

>These are the same people that praise western societies, use products made by western industries, use technology invented by western societies and also drugs made by western medical science will fall short of adopting the western values that made west what it is. Nah! We need to keep our pure virgin culture untouched by western degeneracy. 

>In our glorious nation, copying/ cheating in exams is a routine. We cherish it. When there are any measures to stop cheating in exams, we boycott the very exam in protest. Nah I am not kidding; read [this for yourself](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/09/india-tried-to-stop-cheating-in-school-so-half-a-million-students-just-skipped-exams/?utm_term=.0dd6e95175aa). Infact I [saved](https://imgur.com/frDBIFC) it for posterity. While in west, you need to take oath of academic integrity before you submit your exam papers. Can we copy this from west?

>Free speech? Can we copy that from west? The practice of open dialogue? Can we copy from west? No don't tell me 2000+ years ago you supposedly had some glorious culture, and we should somehow return to it. 

>1. First, you don't know if it's a glorious culture. 
>2. Second you don't know if it's a open society; we don't have reddit/twitter to complain of nasty behavior in those days. (For example removal of one professor in WB recently. BTW, incidentally the original comment I have written as **before** the asshole professor's name come out in the news giving the credence to this argument)
>3. Third, none of those dialogues are really profound in comparison to the best philosophers that we have today and that too their arguments being supported by excellent scientific method as well as scientific experience. 
>4. Fourth, that supposed glorious culture doesn't exist today and IMPORTANTLY you don't even have an idea how it used to be back then. We can argue what/who was responsible till the cows come home but that will only add to our useless victim complex that's worth less than piece toilet paper that's wiped your ass and down the drain.
>5. Fifth, there are better cultures right now, today (check out Scandinavian countries or other examples) that are WAY WAY better than any other nation was able to on ANY day in the entire course of humanity. We are better of taking examples from them.",Reddiquette,2019-01-21 13:53:06

We really need to talk about Flairs.,109,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",Reddiquette,2017-05-15 21:21:16
"Randians who have had arranged marriages, what was your moment of love?",121,48kju9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/48kju9/randians_who_have_had_arranged_marriages_what_was/,186,"Note: question not sponsored by Tanishq.  
Edit: Changed flair to reddiquette to get serious replies.",SharmajiKaBeta," [deleted] Sweet question. So actually I do have a story. It was the first Durga Puja in our community after I had gotten married to my wife. As a newly married Bengali couple, we finally had something to look forward to and she had something to dress up for. The first few months were awkward for socializing. She was sweet to my friends but didn't really relate to them personally and socializing was more of a chore. So we started staying home more and more on the weekends till we hardly ever went out. My wife used to be a classical dancer in her younger days and loved performing at events such as puja events. However, since this Durga Puja was just a couple of months after marriage she wasn't sure what my family would think of her ""performing"" on stage. She didn't directly tell me but I overheard her talking to her friends about it and I kinda had a feeling that this was a big deal to her. So I decided to encourage her. Told her that she should totally sign up and do what makes her happy. Even I got actively involved in the puja committee (something I typically don't do) just to be more involved. After a few weeks of hesitation she agreed and started going to the practice sessions. This was a time when two of us were still strangers to each other and our communication was fairly formal so even though she knew I was supportive of her performing she didn't know what could piss me off. So for example one night she had to go for her practice around dinner time and instead of just asking me if she should go she just decided that it's better not to bring it up in case I get pissed. (All this I found out later when we finally became friends). Anyway long story short, after a few weeks of mild drama it was the night of Saptami where she was going to go on stage and perform! I was excited to see her finally come on. The moment that is still with me is when I saw her fully decked up on stage, how beautiful she looked, how graceful her moves were. Looking around I realized the whole audience was mesmerized by her. That's when it hit me. I am married to this woman! Wow I am a lucky guy! And just as I was feeling the happy build up, I realized her eyes were completely focussed on me. She didn't care what anybody else in that huge audience was doing, she just wanted to see my reaction and if I approved. That melted my heart and was the first day of our real relationship. I hope that answers your question OP because it took me a while to type out this completely fabricated story. Fuck !! Why do I feel that Scoopwhoop is spying on this article to get some interesting replies & plans to post '12 sweet moments of love admissions in Indian arranged marriages - 7 will make you cry'     
Btw, Fuck You Scoopwhoop !!!  Still waiting for the miracle (married for 6 years probably, forgot the year, got a 2 yr old kid)...  
Only people my wife cares about are my in-laws. 0 care for my family. Period. fuck that. arranged married folks of randia, how awkward was your first time doing the needful with your spouse and how long into your marriage did you gather up the courage to do it?

Arranged marraige love sTory... When she said BC, joint bana .

Practically, moments of love are so less in comparison to that of daily arguments and stress that people might just forget them.

FTFY [removed] Married since 2002. An Arranged marriage initiated by an extended relative. Her parents visited us first, and only after a satisfactory perception of our house and surroundings called us to visit theirs. 

I was 12th pass with 47% marks in arts, only son of a land owner. My father, his father, his father's father, all lived off plowing fields and selling the yield, except that my father plowed the fields with a tractor. My mother and her buffaloes really tied the family together, provided us milk and ghee. She took care of two of our murrah buffaloes, who were raised from the calves of another set of buffaloes, who were further raised from calves as well; all our cattle can be dated back to a single buffalo that my mother brought with her as dowry. She only raised two calves at a time. Rest she sold. Our's was a hard working family. The land that my father inherited from his father, his father from his, and so on, was now very valuable. It was rallying up to the newly constructed 4 lane national highway. Only after coming to know of our assets that her Dad came to pay us a visit.  

She was a student at NIFT. Her dad was a SHO in Harayana police, her mom was a bank official. Girl's name was Miss SO. I saw her for the first time in her house. She was wearing jet black sweater over a green patiala suit and a matching embroidered salwar. Her head were strung together with a head band, out of which were unfurling down her ruby black curly hair; her eyes were pitch black and eyebrows made a perfect arch. She had a dimple on her left cheek and a pointed nose supplemented by a well rounded and decent chin. Her nose was beautiful like a parrot's beak. Her curves were making an impression from over the tight jet black and waist length sweater she was wearing. When she brought us tea I took a quick glance over her bottom, I  can say they were protruding out and inviting my attention, though I chose to swirl away my glance quickly thinking that would be an awkward thing to do. The tea she made was too good and delicate for my taste, too less ginger. I saw her slender and beautiful hands and arms sheathed with henna and bangles while she was handing me the tea cup. At that instant I took a glance over her cleavage too. I surmised that she had perky breasts. When I raised my glance up and met her in her eyes, she shrugged and furrowed her eyebrows as if she was asking me why are you looking at my breasts? At that time I almost spilled my tea. We sat in her house for an hour, we exchanged glances and shared little grins first and monstrous laughter later when we said good bye. 

Long story short. I fell in love with her in that very moment. We had sex in the very first night. It was awesome. We broke our bed. Her dad so impressed, he sent us a new bed next day. A bed from him was the only article of dowry I ever received. Our first one was born exactly 9 months from there. Such was love, a powerful sensation.  it was all awkward at first we started using phone after that and it happened..  Here again....

BC मजा आ गया , कसम से!

बहुत दिनों के बाद सॉलिड बकचो$! हुई।

Inorganic content and vote manipulation - a community reach out,68,4ktrhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4ktrhq/inorganic_content_and_vote_manipulation_a/,113,"Dear subscribers,

We have grown tremendously as a community to 50,000+ subscribers including 23,600+followers on Twitter. We've also had diverse activities including citizen activism (NetNeutrality, SaveTheMap, SaveTheCinema etc.), politics and AMAs. Thank you for your contributions.

Recently, we and many of our subscribers have taken note of inorganic content on the front page. This adversely affects the quality of the sub and discussion. We are in touch with admins and have successfully thwarted many such efforts. You, our subscribers, could also have a stake in these efforts. Specifically, we would recommend you to visit and constructively vote on 
  
* New Queue - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/new/
* Controversial Queue - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/controversial/
 
In regards to voting, here are [some general rules](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting)
 
* Don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it

* Don't mass downvote someone else's posts.

* Don't upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it.

* Don't report posts just because you do not like them. 

Thank you for your patience. We hope to see more organic content on the front page with informed, civil discussions.",r_india_mod," What is inorganic content? Serious question. This place has been overrun by political trolls who are obnoxious beyond belief its quite most people who used to visit reddit India have left and the fewer and fewer people are interacting on the forums despite record subscribers.  This is a disaster. 

Yay, positivity! No more downvotes! That will solve all our problems! /S 

This is a terrible move. Instead of taking away the downvote feature, you should have just stickied a well written self.post atop the sub for a week or 10 days, reminding users to visit the new queue and upvote accordingly, to account for downvote brigades. 

This is terribly reactionary and seemingly poorly thought out. 

Taking away the downvote feature to deal with downvote brigades is akin to taking away every Indians right to vote, because some Indians are engaging in voter fraud. 

Why don't you try to *improve the system of democracy* in this sub by reminding users to be more proactive in the new queue, where the battle for what content makes it to the front page is one and lost between 8am and 12pm every day? 

I hate to be such a vocal critic but this is just ridiculous. An /r/india mod in the comments section here said that this is a trial run and I certainly hope so. If this is a permanent change it will most likely greatly reduce my amount of time here. I literally can't do something integral to Reddit on this sub that I can do **on any other sub on this website**. 

I mod a sub that is much larger than this one, and that, based on its very nature gets a lot more downvote brigades than this one does (/r/conspiracy), and to take away the downvote feature *from every subscriber to the sub*, because some users are downvote brigading is equivalent to taking away everyone's rights to punish a few. 

I can't support this, there is an obvious alternative that I highlighted above that is superior. 

Also, as another user here has pointed out, this rule can be easily circumvented in the comments section of submissions by visiting users own pages and downvoting their comments there. 

I have an idea, why don't you try to market this as the:

**""War on Downvotes""**

That might be more easily marketable to users here, you're trying to sell this new draconian voting system to, /s.  Meh. The plan to prevent vote brigading by removing the downvote button is an epic FAIL. The brigaders have figured out a solution: They can just go to the account page of the poster and view their messages(posts and comments) where the downvote button is present.

End result: Lots of comments and posts, like stuff I posted this morning, still get mass-downvoted. People who dedicate their time specifically for this crap won't be deterred. Also if everyone could just stop downvoting comments when they don't praise your opinion / agenda / supreme leader. And this has been downvoted. gj >Don't down vote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it


Cant wait for the day when this happens  Downvote disabled, is this a permanent feature or on trail basis.  Has anyone noticed that articles critical of BJP and Modi do not make it to the front page anymore? 

Nowadays front page articles are from one particular site: Swarajyamag. 

The articles I post gets 5-6 downvotes in the first five minutes. 

 Very good step .

Reminds me of Obama introduces  a palindrome to Modi post's mass vote brigadier army of aaptrads   > Don't mass downvote someone else's posts.

Many subreddits I've come across don't have Downvote options. Its like Upvote or don't vote. Can r/india do the same. The problem arises with people consider upvotes and downvotes in reddit as an equivalent to like and dislike ( if fb had one) in facebook.  In addition- if you are not subscribed to the subreddit- you shouldnt be allowed to vote. A lot of subreddits- already do implement this. Seems like a reasonable approach to me. If you are not part of the community - you shouldn't be voting. This probably won't solve the vote brigading- but might still help. Because while number of active users in this sub have greatly increased- i am not sure that number is reflected by the active subscriber count. Again I could be wrong on this- but my 0.02 Its good to see the changes done in this sub are actually working for good...keep up the good work mods what does  this line mean: ""Don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it""

I have no right to voice my opinion if it is against the views of majority (otherwise acceptable)? If it is so, does it leave the subreddit /r/india democratic?

Don't you believe in the minority of opinion? OR you just don't believe when the minority consist of one? 

Isn't upvoting or downvoting a personal choice based on what one likes or doesn't like (personally or professionally or in whatever ways except ad hominem)?

it intrigues me! Oh, come on!

You remove the savethemap sticky for this??? Great move mods for making the downvote button disappear! Hope this works and brings some sanity! So you've removed the downvote feature? Damn thats pretty cool. I didnt know reddit would be this flexible. I think its cool, lets see how it works out",Reddiquette,2016-05-24 21:27:37
[MOD POST] /r/india needs your help to maintain civility and a balanced discourse. Please spare a few minutes to give this a read. 2 new flairs introduced.,233,2cnzjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2cnzjy/mod_post_rindia_needs_your_help_to_maintain/,420,"Hi /r/India,  
Standing close to the 26,000 subscriber mark, today we kind of have a bitter-sweet moment here on /r/India. Most of you must be aware of the blatant hate-mongering, religious intolerance and rumors being spread on our subreddit, riding safely under the pretext: Freedom of Speech. Any action taken by us to regulate this, is met with an army of hateful comments, downvotes and outcries of censorship. 

This propaganda is in no way the combined sentiment of /r/india and is basically the work of a few dedicated individuals using this subreddit as their personal weapon. With their strong language, and hateful comments, these radicals have kind of succeeded in discouraging people with opposing views to even bother participating and questioning their false, bigoted propaganda. 

We let this go on for quite a while now, hoping the community will self-moderate and drown these seemingly hate-filled radicals with their voice and votes, but after seeing comments openly asking for genocide of certain religious sects (you know which) getting upvoted to the top, we have decided to put an end to this ourselves.

Following are a couple of new rules and re-iterations on existing ones:

1. **Unverified Flair**: Posts making claims without any credible source are liable to get flaired as Unverified by the mods. This flair will be removed swiftly if OP or any other user provides substantial proof  for their claims. NOTE: Facebook updates and/or tweets by unverified parties do not count as *credible source*.

2. **Moderated Flair**: Starting today, *all religious posts* are *liable* to be marked as **Moderated** by the mods. Off late, we have seen discussions going from *Manusmriti to cow-urine, riots to burning people alive.* Moderated posts will be actively monitored for hate speech and off-topic comments inciting hatred and bigotry. This flair can *also* be applied to non-religious post which are controversial by their nature, based on our discretion, to keep the discussion civil and on-topic. Moderated is similar to the [\[R\]eddiquette flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/reddiquette) and all the rules that come with it.  As a suggestion, please remember, /r/india is a subreddit about India, Indians and matters that directly related to India. Please use theology subreddits for generic discussions on religions.

 Before the questions about censorship come up, let us clear things up (to the best of our abilities) as to what the Moderated flair will ensure (just one from million examples):  
 * We will NOT remove your opinions on how Kejriwal is a drama queen, playing appeasement politics, or why Modi doesn’t care about Muslims (provided it is relevant to discussion at hand)
 * But if your opinion is how all muslims need to be deported to Pakistan and Hindus need to drown in cow piss, I’m sorry we really don’t need your brilliant opinion in moderated threads.  
 * *+1 to OP*: No thanks, we have votes for this. Take your love for OP to PMs  
 * *OP is just wearing saffron glasses / OP is secular*: Stop! we are better off without your insight. 

 There are infinite such examples which cannot possibly be covered, but this should give you a basic idea.

3. **Self Posts:** /r/india is a social media platform to share links, and for thoughtful discussion. This is not twitter or facebook to share biased and unsubstantiated opinions. This is not your soapbox to vent in the title and leave an empty post behind for people to squabble about. All self posts that have no OC in the body will be removed. Context is important. Self posts with incendiary titles will be removed.

4. **Banning of users:** We issue warnings to users as a courtesy, and to give them a chance to realign with the rules on /r/india. As such, banning people is solely a moderator’s discretion. The nature of the ban (temp ban or otherwise, number of warnings) depends on the user’s history and the kind of comment(s) in question. Hate speech, users with singular agenda will be banned instantly with no warnings.

5. **Use Reddiquette Flair:**  If you’re looking to have a serious discussion on a topic, if you're sick ad tired of the same bunch of users turning every topic into a religious/political shitfest, please use the [\[R\]eddiquette flair.](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/reddiquette) We’ll make sure the trolls and hate-mongers stay away, 

**Lastly, Please Participate More:** Your votes make a difference. 

We really want to request each and every one of you to help us in keeping this subreddit a clean and civil forum for discussion. At the end of the day, /r/india is as good as the vocal participants. If you want to see a thoughtful community that is able to discuss important issues without petty squabbles, **go and Vote! Speak up** and be part of the voice. Upvote all the relevant and quality comments. Downvote irrelevant comments/posts, bigotry, name-calling and hatred filled comments.  
You don't have to limit yourselves to Random Daily Discussion or a few fun threads, just because some devious users can't make a coherent sentence without calling you names. Systematic harassment and bullying will not be tolerated on /r/India, and if you're on the receiving end of this behavior, feel free to drop us a message anytime.

We are just 10 mods spread across different timezones, and it’s very difficult to do his without community’s support. Thanks for reading and hope to see a better /r/India tomorrow!

**TL;DR**:  

1. Unverified Flair for posts without credible source
2. All religious posts might be flaired as *Moderated*: which is essentially R enforced.
3. Please participate more: Vote, and make your voice heard. Question bigotry and don't be intimidated by a few hatefilled users


",AwkwardDev," Just for the context: this thread http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2bri88/mosque_built_where_durga_nagpal_had_razed_wall/cj897j0?context=3

Most of the offensive comments stand deleted so I'm just posting my context. The top comment was something on the lines of mass killing and ethnic cleansing. I mean there was even one user who corrected me saying it wasn't ethnic but religious cleansing (WTf does it matter). Then a plethora of Muslims must go to Pakistan and such. 

I mean I'm all for trolling. Troll all you want. But the moment you step from harmless trolling into 'lel kill teh maslims' - then it's not trolling. It's class A douchebaggery. 

Reddit is a free speech site, yes. But free speech doesn't mean you espouse hate and killing. 

I regularly bicker with rahulthewall and both he and I know it's harmless. He has never fucking lost his temper but then one of you gents start calling him an aapiya and what not, and the discourse moves from lels to I don't want to listen to you because you once wrote something in favor of aap. Really guys ? Is that fucking mature ? 

So please, go ahead and troll all you want. But don't bring mass murder into discussion. And oh, please don't call me left right or center because that fucking ruins any discussion, with or without lels.  Nice going mods. I guess its time to stop filtering political posts now.  [Insert Generic ""Change Is Bad""/Freedom of Speech Argument Here]

In all seriousness, I think this is a good idea. One of the things I've always disliked about this sub is unwarranted bigotry.
Keep up the great work. Really nice of you but don't expect much civility here,its been very annoying lately.People just seem to be out with their keyboards looking for someone to kill. Nice to read this. I have unsubscribed from the sub a while back but occasionally cone on to see .. And this was the exact reason for me leaving.

Its unbelievable how much hate people have towards each other in this sub weather its based on religion/caste/ race.

I will resub if the quality really improves! What's the self post ka funda? Pliss to ELI5 Mods, can we have more flairs for the posts themselves? The binary distinction as political and non-political isn't very helpful. I see many posters here who seem to always post with a specific negative and political agenda, always being angry and hateful and only ever posting to attack or criticize a certain political group.

They are starting flame wars and making this subreddit's environment poisonous and depressing.

Why do mods not take any action against them? Please don't be afraid to speak up if the rumour is true that these posters are in fact mods themselves, pushing their personal agendas for this subreddit, and hence not subject to disciplinary action. 

>This propaganda is in no way the combined sentiment of /r/india and is basically the work of a few dedicated individuals using this subreddit as their personal weapon. With their strong language, and hateful comments, these radicals have kind of succeeded in discouraging people with opposing views to even bother participating and questioning their false, bigoted propaganda.

....

>Hate speech, users with singular agenda will be banned instantly with no warnings.

I can name some such posters with examples if the mods ask. But they are active and post threads and comments pushing their hateful agenda every day; will the mods please take some action even if it means banning their own accounts? :( Agree. I was eager to subscribe to the India subreddit, but most of my friends warned me how it's really shitty and you get called an Aaptard or something like that whenever you give an opinion. Freedom of speech doesn't mean you abuse other people till they stop commenting out of fear. Also inciting violence doesn't really count protected under free speech.

That being said, I also urge everyone to comment in spite of the haters. Let us have more steps like this when problems come. Let's not lose a subreddit. I've seen non Indians on other sub's talking about how r/India is full of intolerant assholes Dear Mods, when can I buy you a beer?

I will participate more and be nice to everyone if you are actually going to ban single propaganda users who type 18-20 hours a day.

Good luck. Let's make this place a better place. This sticky is a goddamn joke.

Morons like u/prophet99 trolling on every thread and the mods do nothing.
Threads about a certain community show up and are immediately marked ""Moderated"" when there is no evidence of hate-speech or inflammatory language.

 This thread is a farce. The mods themselves(or rather, their friends and alt accounts) are the biggest political propgandists, bigots and trolls on r/india. Yet these accounts never face any action, and instead when reported mods bend over backwards to defend them against the complainants and attack the latter. I would like to suggest that hatefull casteist threads should also be banned. Under the current situation casteism and communalism both should be treated with equal strictness. I am wary of such rules because the ones enforcing them can never be fully objective and everyone, even mods, have biases.

For instance,

>The nature of the ban (temp ban or otherwise, number of warnings) depends on the user’s history and the kind of comment(s) in question. Hate speech, users with singular agenda will be banned instantly with no warnings.

Most users here have an agenda. Some very strong. But I don't see any action taken in most cases. +1 to mods. All religious hatemongers should drown in cow piss.

(I'm just kidding. Please don't warn me for this.) Looks to be a good move..

The way conversations usually would transpire on such threads was the major reason i don't usually participate in religious or political threads..

Hopefully the discussions become more civil now, but everyone can voice their (sane) opinions Thank you for volunteering your time in curating this online community.  U/AwkwardDev kindly revise this first thing everyday before assuming mod duties and insulting religious figures.  This is a monumentally political move by you to promote your collective mindset on the rest of us. Irrespective of what your motivations are, this will obviously be implemented with bias because lets face it the mods are mostly of a certain political slant. 

You are trying to essentially take on speech you feel is offensive like ""OP is secular or communal"". Offense is a subjective thing and is also a question of taste and the audience. If the audience disagrees with the post, they will exercise their opinion, We do not need the mods to be sanctimonious.

Also, where was this outrage when people said we should wipe out UP and Bihar because of rapes or Anti TN statements due to freebies ? All of those qualify as hate speech too but we did not have the equivalent of Indira gandhi approving editorials now did we ? Why is it that your sensibilities are more hurt by people offending a certain religion. My point is not that one is less ""hateful"" than the other but that your perception is also skewed by your politics. 

This is your subreddit and you can spread whatever propaganda you want but don't act holier than thou about you taking offense to things that the large number of us don't as evidenced by the votes. If you truly want to be open and balanced, make more people mods, people who are not perceived as being as biased as the current set before implementing these regressive steps.

 [deleted] Areee yaar you mods are now behaving like wikipedia admins. to everyone 'demanding' something or the other.. if you haven't noticed.. this sub ain't a democracy.  Couldn't you think of more general examples rather using (self) or otherwise what you consider people's opinion ?  +1 to op and Kejriwal is drama king
 Second to that. We must not make a spectacle and a royal ass of ourselves collectively. Let sanity prevail, please!  Users with singular agenda 

What does that mean unsticky this this thread already Guise we can post links to ads here, post photos of Baba Ramdev abs, anything here - no one is responding anymore.  [Fuck yeah ! more rules](http://gfycat.com/HotThinHen) Good +1 Wah! 

I am heading to /r/merimarzi, interested people can join. 

Thanks but no thanks /r/india mod.  Though these new rules are a bit against the concept of free speech, but these were required considering the kind of discourse that has been happening over the past few days

+1 to the mods  I'm sorry I'm putting it here, but the unverified twitter rule isn't working. 

I've seen several links to unverified twitter accounts getting to /r/India front page. 

I agree that it is difficult to moderate, but having a rule and not following it or following it sporadically is worse than not having the rule in the first place. 

Please have a look into the matter.  This is a great initiative, and I can't think any better solution to the problem at hand.

However, I fear that it may be too much work for you. The effort required in manually monitoring all comments would be much greater than your present workload.

So far, the sub has been moderated very well; the motivation in your team - for essentially a thankless job - is certainly not lacking. But, pretty soon, we will be having a thousand concurrent active users. Well, I guess you would have already discussed the consequences of the move, I just hope that the everyone was on board with the added responsibility.

If you later feel that this is not possible, the sub can potentially brainstorm over other possible solutions (though I presently have none to offer). It will certainly be awesome if you pull it off.

Best of luck! ""...The work of a few dedicated individuals using this subreddit as their personal weapon...""

Seriously? are mods in denial that a vocal majority of the active participants in r/India supports a certain community. Its a ""few"" dedicated individuals? 

BULLSHIT  [deleted] Good initiative guys. 

But what are you doing about people who get banned and are back up with an alt the next day spewing their bigoted crap all over again?

Do you keep a track of reported users or IPs. How the heck would you flair all this from a mobile.

What about discussion posts, half my posts (colonial India, Punjab, Israel etc) would be unverified? How can I verify a thought I am using to trigger a discussion? Give it up, seriously. You cannot legislate morality. Mods are cut from the same cloth as the rest of the users and you simply cannot make rules that make everyone behave in the way you want. You're adding more and more rules every month and the effect is a big zero. 

*V r lyk dis only.* One Question. Does the Concept of Moderated threads apply to *Dinanath Batra type* posts? i am happy :-) thank you mods for keeping it civil and pointing our mistakes. I like how the mods like to create more work for themselves. Can you please take a tougher stand on spamming? There is one idiot on RDD who does this shit a lot in the name of ""bringing Imran Khan back"".  Yeha, you removed them once, but the [person is back with an alt](http://www.reddit.com/user/AajBahutKhushHogaTum). Finally. Thank you. 

Though not what I was looking for (would've loved a flair just for religion) this is hopefully a step in the right direction.

Thank you again. Fuck religion. It destroys everything. Even subreddits. Good job Mods.

 [deleted] Can we also please get rid of comments on the lines of ""Where are [secular, liberal, right wingers, chaddis etcetera]""? I do commend your initiative and willingness to 'micro-moderate', if nothing else. 

Just one recommendation, though. 
If we already have the R funda, do we really need a separate flair for 'moderated'? Can't we just say that all religious discussions will be marked R by default? This will make it simpler for all parties concerned.

Lastly, I worry that this step is becoming alarmingly like the ones taken by the censor board in the early 2000s. There is a flavour of ""we know what's best for you and you have no choice but to abide by what we say"". 

I feel that we should trust the voting system in an unmoderated environment to get a true feel of what content is 'relevant'. I am assuming most folks here are not children and - as an extension - there should be no need to direct their actions. 

Anyway, maybe you guys had a different picture in mind. I wish you and the sub all the best, going forward.  I think someone needs to explain Reddit upvotes and downvotes to the Mods.

If something is upvoted to the top, and mods remove it claiming that ""This propaganda is in no way the combined sentiment of /r/india"" then what is the meaning of having upvotes and downvotes ?

This is nothing but an attempt to impose a specific political viewpoint on r/India.

It is bound to fail. 

Mods of r/India will join the ranks of Goebbels and Stalin as examples of failed attempts to force a particular point of view on an uncooperative population.

 Freedom Of Speech does not mean Freedom To Be An Asshole. Nice going mods. Nice. More Censorship. Yay. What can I say, I'm lovin' it :) Ugh. It seems Indian secularism is spreading from media to social media.

Considering the political orientation of the mods here and the kind of views they hold(One of them once said the Godhra train burning was an RSS conspiracy) I know well which section of posters and posts are going to be selectively 'moderated'. > We’ll make sure the trolls and hate-mongers stay away,

How will you be doing this? Will you mark out people based on your own discretion and prevent them posting comments?

> Posts making claims without any credible source are liable to get flaired as Unverified by the mods.

Does this mean I can post tweets from un verified accounts and flair them accordingly?

 Why do guys delete comments :( I'm really happy to see /r/india taking a more serious turn. Thank you mods! Regarding trolls. I think people downvote them. Why do you have to delete them. Why don't you guys ever consult the community at large on what changes we would like? Well all your previous rules din't make much difference. So I won't hold my breath.  How the heck would you flair all this from a mobile.

What about discussion posts, half my posts (colonial India, Punjab, Israel etc) would be unverified? How can I verify a thought I am using to trigger a discussion? +1 to OP! This is indeed turning into a stasi circle,anyone in the circle is considered civil and normal,anyone outside the circle needed to be beaten,broken down and reset and brought into the circle.

When did profiling someone from comment history became a rule? this is civil? 

 Seeing that all you mods are basically either AAP sympathizers or just plain anti-BJP/Hindu, can we have a couple of right wingers in the mod panel? Or will it defeat the whole purpose of this sub? YAAAAYYYYY, THE MODS HAVE HEARD ME!!! I have been asking for a 'Propaganda' flair for some time now for posts making claims about their favorite political party without any source or citations. I knew that the mods would like this idea! about damn time... >/r/india[6] is a social media platform to share links, and for thoughtful discussion. This is not twitter or facebook to share biased and unsubstantiated opinions. This is not your soapbox to vent in the title and leave an empty post behind for people to squabble about. All self posts that have no **OC** in the body will be removed. Context is important. Self posts with incendiary titles will be removed.


What is  OC? Orignial Content? if I wanted to share something I found on Deviant Art,(eg: [this](http://molee.deviantart.com/art/Karna-419165014) ) ,  I was not the creator of the content,  does that make it copied content? In that case, does that go against the rule and hence gets me banned?   Wow, a lot has changed here. Seems ages since I was last on this sub. What's with a certain mod deleting the mere mention of his favorite cricket sub-reddit on this sub-reddit? [deleted] For a long time, this sub reminded me of the rediff comment section. Where every remote post about india or pakistan prompted unwarranted hate towards a particular community. It's more or less the same here, where the ride to top comment is based on the 'jasbaat' rather than logic or rational reasoning. Fuck yes. About time. Not a moment too soon. You have my sword. 

[anybody who wants to scream censorship should read this](http://lesswrong.com/lw/c1/wellkept_gardens_die_by_pacifism/) > With their strong language, and hateful comments, these radicals have kind of succeeded in discouraging people with opposing views to even bother participating and questioning their false, bigoted propaganda.

Why don't you mark your own post unverified? Where is your data to back this up? It seems you are making stuff up to create more rules to give a preference to the mods' bias.


I had said this previously and will say it again. /r/India is what it is due to its community, mods did not build /r/india, the users did.

This seems like a futile attempt to control discourse by a small group of elitist mods who think they know better than the users. Also who says civility is better

If you want to force rules down our throat, give us some say in who the mods should be. I also feel that mods in this sub are very homogenised in thought and that is going to turn r/india into a completely one sided sub like /r/politics sooner or later. 

All the mods here seem to support liberal appeasement politics and that is OK but we also need mods who do not toe the liberal line blindly. > OP is secular

Mods, will identifying an entity as 'secular' be considered as amounting to unacceptable conduct? ! OK maro koi bachne na paye

/s for the maads Thank you. This was desperately needed. Whats wrong with letting downvotes decide what goes and what does not? 

You first say the propaganda is not a combined sentiment of /r/India but then go on to say that these 'hateful comments' got upvoted to the top. So which is it? If that is what this group is made up of, then that is what the group is made up of. All the rules & shutting people up will not help.

And what if someone calls for killing of all terminally ill vegetable people? Is that hateful genocide talk?
Or the non-painful killing of certain parts of society for some argument for good of society. Then what? Can we not discuss these Ideas, or ideas like these ones? Why put Religion on some holy pedestal that cannot be touched by dirty hands?

Why do mods want to get into the business of controlling content here, is it because you can get into legal trouble for whats posted on here?

I think the only time you should intervene is when people make personal attacks at one & another - personally. But no one on here can assume the responsibility of 'defending' a group - no matter how that group is defined.

My 2 cents.

Edit: Typos This thread looks like the last bit of freedom to break all the rules without abhay consequences. I guess it's time to get dirty.  We definitely need a ""yeh kya chutiyapa hai?"" flair.

Thanks for the good work Mod(i)s! I demand ban on banning by mods. Some mods have inherent hatred for users who don't always agree with their view and can flip to ban a user without second thought.

Even if they un-ban later, the constitutional right - Freedom of speech, has been abused by those in power and Constitution of India is above r/india's petty rules. Heil Hitlers! Heil Hitlers! Heil Hitlers! 

So who among you mods is the equivalent of Rajdeep Sardesai and who is Sagarika Ghose?  Been saying this for the past fucking 2 years and only now you realize this. And then you blame policy paralysis and what not on the poor govt, yahan toh you sirs don't even have any opposition! Jiski laathi uski bhains Can we also regulate use flair? There's some bloke here that has ""Real freedom is Islam free India"" or some bigoted nonsense like that. I personally would love to see active Muslim involvement in this subreddit in addition to the other demographics, so it would be nice if peoples flair wasn't so uninviting. India belongs to the Muslims, too. India is so unstable religiously that even its Sub Reddit has riots Somebody give him reddit gold! So as a non believer, if I ask genuine questions intended to try and suggest to people that an elephant god could not have existed, do the mods consider discussion of this nature to be hate speech as well? Your examples were very convenient and extreme, but you did not address posts of this nature. Nonetheless, it is my hope that your protection of religious sentiments does not marginalize me from preaching my beliefs or lack thereof, else in truth this subreddit is simply a club for the religious. Wow more types of flair amazing how did no one ever think this would be a good idea before bow this is literally amazing.

Why can't mods just ban all hate mongering as a standard.

That ought to shut these secular jholawallah sanghis up for good. Jai Hind!",Reddiquette,2014-08-05 14:29:35

JP of loksatta : msg to aap! Hope they join hands soon!



The beginning of the end of traditional politics in India

Lok Satta Party takes pride in congratulating the Aam Aadmi Party on a compelling debut in the Delhi elections. 

It is a resounding victory for good politics in India, the first step of which was taken earlier in the 2009 Assembly Elections in Andhra Pradesh by Lok Satta. The second step, now in Delhi by AAP bore fruit well before polling day through the unusual choice of Harsh Vardhan as the Chief Ministerial candidate by the traditional BJP camp.

Good politics has raised the bar on what is the acceptable minimum in this election.

The vision for 21st century politics that Lok Satta has conceived, espoused and unwaveringly practiced, is now in some measure showcased by AAP in the Delhi elections. They crafted their campaign, candidates selections and fund raising practices on the back of the Electoral Reforms that Lok Satta pioneered and delivered to India, be it the declaration of candidate assets, tax deductible political donations, sanitizing voter rolls etc.

This is first and foremost a people's victory. We salute the people of Delhi for coming out to vote en masse and providing a clear mandate for departure from corruption and nepotism.

We wish AAP all the very best in transitioning from contesting elections to driving good governance in Delhi. Lok Satta has long been able to bat several notches above our league with just one MLA in the State of Andhra Pradesh and yet drive seminal changes to public policy, constitutional amendments, and bureaucratic reforms. These outcomes are a reflection of Lok Satta's unflinching commitment to putting India first and approaching all problem solving with maturity, expertise, influence, negotiation and convergence for the greater good while staunchly refusing to paint the other as evil with a broad brush. 

We must never indulge in parochial or divisive politics, or pander to short populism at the cost of long term public good.

The fashioning of a genuinely modern democracy is a long and arduous one that takes many teams and many players working in concert. We are joyous to see a party like AAP enter the fray, applaud their courage, efforts and results, and invite many more parties to walk with us down this path.

Clean politics has taken seed in urban India, as is evidenced by our own experience in Hyderabad and the Delhi results. 

This will raise the bar in politics to transform slowly but surely, even the traditional dynastic parties into healthy, vibrant institutions that reflect the plurality and potential of the Indian politic. And as it spreads from urban to rural India across the next decade, it has the power to reshape India's destiny.

We look forward to that day.

- Jayaprakash Narayan Congress: Delhi, please go and vote.



Delhi: Pehle AAP. Asked whether SheilaD  failed to read the public mood she sarcastically said, *""Bewakoof hai na hum?""*

 DID. NOT. EXPECT. THIS. AT. ALL




Arvind, damn son.  Arvind Kejriwal is leading against Sheila Dixit! Congress offer AAP  outside support . But AAP has rejected . Sheila dixit sent in her resignation. Fuck yes!! With that folks am gonna hit bed. Thanks mods, sunny and rest.  

Awesome job Aap. Thanks to volunteers and the folks who believed in them all along. For naysayers, you guys in a way fuelled fire for folks like me  ;) congrats bjp! Hopefully this marks new beginning of politics.. Good night! Congress knows they are having a bad day, when even Barkha Dutt is taking a shit over them on NDTV hahahah [removed] Yogendra yadav is the best spokesperson aap can find. Dude has all it takes- Patience, subtle sarcasm and knowledge  Somewhere Rahul is seen weeping and Sonia saying power is Poisson  Do it same with Kapil Sibal (during lok sabha elections) what happened to Shiela Dixit. Jayanti Natrajan on NDTV: Our political party is not a charitable organisation. We are not here to serve the people. We are here to win elections, come into power.

Arvind - 10438; Sheila - 4909. 




Here: http://eciresults.ap.nic.in/ConstituencywiseU0540.htm?ac=40 **BREAKING NEWS**: Sheila Dikshit resigns as Delhi CM RE-ELECTION. Youngest MLA: AAP candidate from Deoli wins. Age 25 :)

https://twitter.com/NBTDilli/status/409588073278611456 Just did a quick check:

of all seats with less than 1000 difference

bjp leads cong-4

aap leads cong -3

bjp leads aap -2

aap leads bjp-1

aap leads bsp -1

bsp leads bjp- 1

cong leads bjp - 1

Edit: 11:50 EC site

bjp leads aap -1

aap leads bjp-3

bjp leads cong-2

aap leads cong - 2

bjp leads bsp -2 Chhattisgarh spoilng the party! Kejriwaal win by 22000 votes .Great victory . Saurabh Bharadwaj from Greater Kailash is leading comfortably. And AAP has over 8000 votes lead from Seemapuri - the constituency from where Santosh Koli was supposed to be fighting from but was murdered. Her brother is fighting from the same seat and leading big time. Did a quick check in delhi. NOTA is 5th in most results SIKH JOURNALIST WHO THREW SHOE AT HOME MINISTER P.CHIDAMBARAM, WINS. AAP candidate leading by a huge, huge margin in my constituency, the traditional stronghold of BJP. One thing is clear, AAP is the preferred choice of many middle and upper middle class voters. 




Edit: The local AAP office here is ecstatic and the brooms are out. Amazing scenes. I'll try and take pictures. Can't promise, my phone cam is really acting weird. The very fact that the Delhi elections are discussed on r/india far more often than the elections in the other 4 states, indicates that AAP is having a great impact on democracy in India. If it were not for AAP a vast majority of us would not care about these elections. The major political parties in India have always been in cahoots and Indian elections have had almost no impact on the lives of most of its citizens. Regardless of how many seats AAP wins I hope we all realize that this is the first time a grassroots organization, built by volunteers and without any kind of corporate backing can have great impact on Indian elections. **New Delhi**

Click on source to get the formatting  Goddamn!! Rajdeep and Prannoy's studios are too busy trying to establish a 'Brand Shivraj' in MP. Varadabhai at NDTV is trying too well to dilute BJP's trend by bringing out little details. [](/fuckthatshit) Analysts explaining Sheila getting defeated by Kejriwal equals that of Raj Narain defeating Indhira Gandhi at Rae Barely! :D Few bold predictions,....


Expect lot more social media promoters a.k.a. paid shills or trolls to do fight online...  just like the wu mao in China. 

Social media promoter will become a job description

Rahul will get more voice to speak his mind,  as the stupid balladeers will shut up now. But it depends if he can salvage the party.  If he fails expect PRiyanka and damaadji on stage.  If neither happens,  INC May break up


BJP has momentum now.  Unless they do something stupid,  they are well set for next year.  Expect TDP, BSP, Didi,  amma to consider alliance with mighty modi.
 Yo Delhi! Am not sleeping after long day to see congress bite the dust. Don't yo disappoint! 

Go aap!  [deleted] Abhishek manu singhvi : trying to defend the undefendable. Hahaha  What  most of the people wanted, BJP Winning and Sheila loosing to Kejiriwal. Todays morning looks more beautiful. Sheila dixit loses by a whopping margin of 5000 votes... Kapil Sibal's  Zero^®TM©KapilSibal Loss theory about this election: Zero wins, total Loss; Hence Zero-Loss is proved. [](/lol) Dr harshvardhan ahead by 43350  votes .

 [removed] What time does the counting start? Official Results

http://eciresults.ap.nic.in/ 70/70 bjp 31 aap 25 : no clear majority as of now! 70/70 bjp :29 aap 26 ..  Remember arvind saying he's joining politics to defeat folks like sheela??  And he's doing it. Time for some fun : sanjay jha defending congress.. Kejriwal is leading with 3500 votes over Sheila Shazia leading in rk  puram.  Props to EC's website. Constituency wise results also available. Frequently updated.  AAP’s Shazia Ilmi from RK Puram constituency lags behind 


http://www.niticentral.com/2013/12/08/delhi-aaps-shazia-ilmi-lags-behind-from-rk-puram-constituency-166021.html How come NDTV data (http://www.ndtv.com/) seems ahead of Election Commission data (http://eciresults.nic.in/) ? BJP gets first Winner at 12:35 Its so cringing to see Congressis defend Sheila and Rahul.  pic of kejri watching results and smiling

https://twitter.com/sonalndtv/status/409587829660864512/photo/1/large Shazia Ilmi takes the lead in R.K Puram by a close margin! http://eciresults.nic.in/ConstituencywiseU0544.htm?ac=44 Currently 6 seats with a margin below 1000. Aap ahead of bjp on 4 and congress on 1. Bjp candidate ahead of shazia ilmi by 205 votes. From EC website at 1:50 How come Election Commission's website hasn't crashed yet.

Kudos Shazia ilmi loses by 340 votes. With these results i would have to grudgingly accept that if reelections are to be held in view of hung assembly, AAP will surely come to power.  Shazia Ilmi LOSE [deleted] Could there really be a re-election if the assembly is hung? Only muslim cadidates win for khangress in delhi Great work by Arvind Kejriwal. The only way to change the system is by becoming a part of it. It takes guts to enter the political muck and make an attempt to clean it. Kudos to AAP. Arvind Kejriwal - Athirdee style.  Shila Dixit is doing hawan (Special Pooja) at her place. I think its too late for hawan. Looks like I'm late to the party.

Happy that BJP is cruising to a 4-0 scorecard.

Thanks NaMo, SSC, RS, VR and Dr saab. Ok it seems kejriwal is leading now. here is what bhaskar.com has to provide as input on this - 

> 
अरविंद केजरीवाल को नई दिल्‍ली सीट पर मिल रही बढ़त पर हमारे एक्‍सपर्ट अनिरूद्ध शर्मा के अनुसार, नई दिल्‍ली सीट के लुटियन जोन इलाके में चतुर्थ श्रेणी सरकारी कर्मचारियों ने खुलकर केजरीवाल का समर्थन किया। तमाम वाल्‍मीकि समुदाय के लोगों ने सफाई के इस्‍तेमाल के लिए की जाने वाली झाडू को चुनाव चिन्‍ह बनाए जाने पर खुद को इस पार्टी से जोड़ लिया। आप के सभी प्रमुख आंदोलन(सीमापुरी के बिजली आंदोलन को छोड़कर)सभी का केंद्र नई दिल्‍ली रहा। इसका भी लाभ आप को मिला। शीला के खिलाफ चुनाव लड़ने की दृढ़ता दिखाना भी अरविंद के पक्ष में रहा।

gist - apparently fourth class employees in lutyens delhi have supported kejriwal. They have connected themselves with the election sign of AAP - broom & some blah blah about AAP's protests and direct challenge to Sheila Chattisgarh is making me happy. Damn Chattisgarh was far more interesting than other states.  [removed] i'm sitting in China.. now damn proud abt our country that this thing about AAP is even possible in our county....

We are still the greatest and biggest democracy in the world........ Every single MSM walla who was pro-congressi jumping ships to AAP. hahaha

Rajdeep Sardesai looks all set to join AAP by the way he is all gushing about AAP. 22Bjp(+7), 18AAP(+18), 8Cong(-25)...this is great :)
 /u/rajdeep_sardesai and others please differentiate between leads and results. 

The 9 AM update is leads not results. Ak leading against sheela dixit. Kejriwal is in the lead now. [removed] Looking at the heatmap, it seems BJP has a stronghold in all the fringe areas of Delhi. Bjp will firm the goverment by breaking congress party . They have only 8 seats . BJP leading by 25000+ votes from Bawana constituency.  Chattisgarh is giving headache. This is what Anna has to say


 Arvind should not take any support, go for another election if need be but no khichdi : Anna one ""other"" seat is going to Shiromani Akali Dal, which is already an ally of BJP in center. And another ""other"" guy will get a ministry for support. No chances of Re-election if BJP:34, Others:2

EDIT: SAD included in 34, And no coalliation possible in JDU and BJP. Result Re-election. 2 others. Get to work Gandkari ji Mods/Users, I expect this thread to receive a lot of comments. If you guys want to live-stream the comments from this thread you can easily do it by going to this URL.

I would have loved to contribute but I will be travelling in a few hours and will miss most of the action :( The only region from where the Cong needs to be decimated is South India (sans TN which already has done it). Once that is over, we would have the dream of CongressMukthBharat true. Please God let BJP win on their own and keep BSP and Mayawati out of Delhi Polictics. We already have enough corruption in Delhi. Purnesh Modi, #Surat city BJP president leading by more than 25K votes against Congress in Surat West assembly seat by-poll.

@PathanAsmakhan [removed] [removed] Well to the guys below. The original active participation in politics started with development agenda of Modi and IAC movement.  Regarding this anti-corruption, middle class etc, this AAP party is not the first in India. It happened earlier during Jayaprakash Narayan era and his chela Mulayam Singh was Arvind Kejriwal of that time. The second time it happened  during V.P Singh era. Its simply a matter of time and enjoy how history repeats.  [The LIVE feed of election result news from Aam Aadmi Party website.](http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/live.html) BJP attains simple majority in Delhi.

Source: EC Website Deoli seat won by aap! First  mla. Sheela trailing by 500 votes.shazia leading by 90 So what's likely to happen if the BJP falls 1 or 2 short of a majority? Trying to buy out the two independents? Bribe a couple of congressi?  The AAP guy on NDTV looks very wise and knowledgeable about his party's game and the scenario of politics out there, quite like a reflection of who and what sort you'd get if you just make a random pick of a single person from the AAP, given all the random people all the channels have pulled in to randomly interview at the gathering at the AAP HQ. Especially compared to how it would be if similar randoms were picked from other parties.  - Shazia Ilmi losing http://eciresults.nic.in/ConstituencywiseU0544.htm?ac=44 Kejriwal leading by 10,000+ votes. I can hear sound of firecrackers. Shelia loses to kejriwaal . Great win . This is the official source for the results

http://eciresults.ap.nic.in/PartyWiseResult.htm

 Doesn't the government get a chance to appoint a member of the Anglo - Indian community? Few years back when syed sibti was governor this drama was enacted in jharkhand. Any idea if there is anyone who will switch from Congress to BJP during show of Strength? The funny thing is.... in most of the undeclared seats, the difference of votes is still 1000-800 votes... 

So anything can happen..... Congress candidate chaudhari jee who has always win since 1958  has lost this time . NDTV figures differ from EC's. Post official figures.

EC's website puts BJP+ at 32, AAP 27, Cong 9, JD(U) 1 and 1 independent. No majority yet. #Polls2013
 Whatever the results are in Delhi. Hope BJP to win the lok sabha with clear majority. Don't want another Congress rule in center and BJP is the only party that can deliver. This is probably more important reason why are I am not too much excited about AAP win today.  A team becomes B team and B team becomes A team. LOLZ Aap 2 bjp 2 

Am picking these up from diff twitter handles..might not be exact. Kejriwal trailing in New Delhi Sheila Dixit was here... Shazia Ilmi trailing... BHaskar.com shows that BJP has crossed the barrier of 35 seats > Congress: We are basically open to any secular formations.

LOL. Get ready for AAP + Congress coalition.  I'm hoping that the BJP victory in the states assembly elections does not indicate a victory for the BJP in the national elections. Vote share: Congress: 23.7% BJP: 31.9% #AAP: 32.2% NOTA: 0.5%  [removed] I  hope BJP doesnt seriously consider alliance with AAP. Better elections once more than alliance with this party. We will consider the option if AAP approaches for alliance in Delhi: Shakeel Ahmad.

Few observations about this sub.,81,3my4q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3my4q2/few_observations_about_this_sub/,71,"I have experienced the power of hiveminds many times on reddit, the most recent one being in this thread:

https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3mx2b5/next_door_to_delhi_mob_kills_50yearold_injures/

Not ranting specifically about the downvotes here, but it would be nice if people understood that following Reddiquette is essential to maintain the standards of discussions on reddit. Reproducing a part of Reddiquette here specific to voting:

>Vote. If you think **something contributes to conversation**, upvote it. If you think it **does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted** in or is **off-topic** in a particular community, downvote it.

>Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and **examine your reasons for downvoting**, rather than doing so **out of an emotional reaction**, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

Few observations that I want to highlight:

1) People are always going to have a different opinion from that of yours. And this forum should be used to understand that differing opinion and the thought-process behind it. After all, we are trying to learn from each other here. If you still don't agree with that opinion just move on. No one is on a mission here to brainwash people into agreeing to something over here.

2) We are all educated folks here. We know that every human being is complicated and he cannot be labelled and put into neat square boxes. Still,we always want it to be either 'this' or 'that'? If someone is opposing BJP, it makes him a AAP loyalist. If someone is criticising the government it makes him an anti-nationalist. If someone is finding fault with a road project through Western Ghats, it makes him a Maoist.

3) If you don't understand something, ask for more explanation. Don't assume things, vote and then carry that incomplete knowledge elsewhere. Ignorance spreads like wild fire and what you mention here might actually end up in someone's serious coffee-table discussions. Always, support your comments with sources when possible. Also, keep in mind just because a comment has lots of sources, doesn't necessarily mean that opinion is unbiased.

4) Jokes and funny comments - Make them all you want and share the lulz but don't use them to attack someone because his opinion is different from that of the crowd. Doesn't really serve the purpose. You wouldn't do that if you are having a serious discussion with your friends, would you?

5) Generalising and stereotyping - Makes your argument weak if you indulge generalizations and stereotyping (Hindus are blah blah, Modi always does blah blah). We have an issue with /r/worldnews having bad stereotypes about us. Have we checked our own sub before pointing fingers at others?

6) Put yourself in the other guy's shoes - I see a lot of comments criticising people without actually trying to understand their PoV. Why they do/say whatever they did/said? What were the circumstances? Would you have reacted differently if you had been in their place?

There are users, I know of, on this sub who gets downvoted on almost every thread because they generally make unpopular comments which differ from the common opinion (not troll comments, genuinely good sensible comments). The same users get upvoted like crazy if they make a lulzworthy comment. Kind of shows you that there is something seriously broken with how this sub functions sometimes. 

I know this post would probably be downvoted but I wanted to post it nonetheless. I learn a lot from this site and it is still one of the best sources of lulz and learning for me on the internet. I don't want to go hunting for other better sites at least for few more years.",qpaw," > There are users, I know of, on this sub who gets downvoted on almost every thread because they generally make unpopular comments which differ from the common opinion (not troll comments, genuinely good sensible comments).

I have observed this many times. There are few people here who do make sane comments but never get noticed or get heavily get downvoted because it is unpopular. This is really discouraging, I am sure what many lurkers who would had faced it again and again.

...

Yesterday night I was commenting on a thread, which was removed due to some reasons. I am mixing & quoting the comments here from that conversation between me and kash_if. Only our observations, hope you guys find your own voice in this & apply it for the better of yourself & for this sub.

> I don't blindly hate X politician or anything. In many threads I defend him, like that earlier incident which was a non-news. But inventing reasons for something where X politician did take misstep is clearly wrong IMO because that shows that people have fallen victim to the cult of personality; Modi is not a messiah and Kejriwal is not a saviour. They make mistakes, blind supporters of both should accept them!

> Either way people here are taking their love or hate to their extremes just to win petty personal wars. Maybe it is our generation (including me) who is so much clouded with consumerism that they can't see things outside that nor have a purposeful life nor see things objectively.

> We don't realize like many other fanboys of Modi or haters of him, that it is our cognitive bias speaking & we are coming to a conclusion immediately.

> By proving X politician a certain way, what exactly we will get from this individually? Really want to change something about us or our condition? Go out their & do it for once. This circlejerk either way won't mean anything. You are spot on with your observation. This is a strict rule I follow: Avoid any post that has a direct reference to Modi or AK. There are just too many fanboys and haters out here that - 90% chance you are walking into a circle jerk/shit feast.

Instead I stick to posts about policy, technology, net neutrality, askreddit etc. type of posts. Let me quote George Carlin: *'Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.'*
  > We are all educated folks here.

Debatable. This sub has become lulz hangout for sure. Something like this gets posted every month. I am not sure what purpose it serves, but it speaks the truth. Merry Christmas. Dude 90% of randia discussions are either pro/anti BJP/Kejri.

There are a few good posts in between, But that's it. 
> FDI, Growth
Hail Modi. No idea why but that's the bandwagon
> Cows, Hindus, 377, 
Will mudi answer. 

- There is a whole Modi bashing circle jerk going on in all the threads related to the Akhlaq’s murder. What nobody realizes is that it has nothing to do with Modi or whoever is in power?This was happening when congress was in power and will continue to happen until people change.
- Politicians are merely playing with our insecurities, hatred and problems, whether it be based on caste, religion, sex, corruption or age of your reddit account.
- Tomorrow Kejri will do something stupid and then there will be that circlejerk.

So come here for the lulz, see something good once a month and enjoy. common opinion is different . 

You being ready to kill a human being if he harms your cow is different . You were downvoted in that thread because of your defending the murderers with your POINT ( which was bloodthirsty , unreasonable , and let the impression that a hindu hivemind is ok with killing human beings for eating beef )  . 

Not just this point alone , but the series of posts you made defending the murderers does not impress me. I eat beef regularly as a low caste . Go ahead , find and murder me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3mx2b5/next_door_to_delhi_mob_kills_50yearold_injures/cvj1yh7

This fluff piece about teaching us the rules does not impress when I remember that.

 another observation is there are lot of paki handles commenting here as indians. Upvote for you, as per my understanding majority of randia population is here for the lulz or as we say in Hindi ""ठिलवाईगिरी"". Its no wonder people latch on to bandwagons and try to one up each other. >the most recent one being in this thread:

Didn't get this point. You mean people were down voting en masse there? I see positive votes on most posts and 90% total upvotes?

No argument here, just did not understand it.  It's a lost cause OP. Forget it. Whoa just saw your comment history, some posts just attract people without any compassion and always see things black and white. Maybe if some of the trolls got kicked out this sub wouldnt be so polarized. Im not talking about the shills, as i am one myself, but rather the handful of accounts (we all know who they are) that spout straight up hateful garbage. When you see a completely idiotic post  linking modi personally to the lynching with 90+ up-votes, or the famous clooney on every thread talking about how hindus are scum, you are definitely going to get backlash (and then play the victim card) excellent points. you just spoke my mind. up vote for u. Re: your points


1) The problem is being emotionally driven. Most people here, including men, seem to be highly emotionally driven. They downvote out of anger / irritation. This is a small scale version of the sentiment experienced by Charlie hebdo assailants. Intelligence is completely divorced from emotion - discussions should be dispassionate, but I'm not sure mental discipline is a strength in this sub. 


2) Most academic education in this country does not explain things like epistemology, critical thinking, logical fallacies, etc. I personally believe that any education without these concepts is almost completely useless in an environment where issues are discussed and debated. 


3) For a lot of people, the Reddit experience is about satisfying some recreational or stress related release. The goal is rarely to have a productive and meaningful discussion. 


4) A joke directed at someone need not be an attack, but I agree that ad hominems diminish any serious discussion. I would argue that posts ought to be tagged with serious and moderated for this aspect. 


5) Generalization is how learning works, in an academic sense. It's not at all bigoted to generalize about a community or group because of a majority characteristic. When I lived in another country, many of my friends had a first impression about me where they wondered whether I was a vegetarian hindu who believed in ""that God with the many arms"", which I am not. This is a very natural assumption to make about Indians since it describes the average person in the country. If a Generalization does not apply to you, nothing really happens if you let it exist. Most generalizations are rooted in truth. Have you ever heard of generalizations like "" Christians do not eat cabbage""?  Those generalizations don't need to be defended against because everyone will rubbish them. 


6) Empathy is sometimes pointless when the opposing side of the argument is rooted in a straw man or reducto ad absurdum, and the calibre of mind making the argument won't know what this means.  >Hindus are blah blah, Modi always does blah blah

its more about fanatic Hindutvawadis than Hinduism.
 [removed] I have requested mods detect those crazy down-voters who downvote every damn thread on /r/india. 

My personal hypothesis is that there are a bunch of india-hating Pakis lurking around.

PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,44,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

Do your bit to make /r/india a friendlier place! (Please upvote for visibility),214,18mkwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/18mkwq/do_your_bit_to_make_rindia_a_friendlier_place/,157,"Hi /r/india! 

The most common complaints about /r/india arise because of it's culture. Downvoting, abuses and hostility towards differing opinions are very common. We've all had our days when we recoil, aghast, from the cesspool of comments on a particular thread.

Nevertheless, the cloud has a silver lining. Older users will agree that things have improved significantly since the days of the multiple -ki-baap, -ki-maa, and _spokesperson accounts. How can we nurture and sustain this delicate green shoot of civil discussion? Here are some guidelines, adapted from [reddit's ettiquette guide.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

###1. The downvote is not a ""dislike"" button
Please do not downvote a post or a comment only because you think it's wrong, or you're not interested in it. 

Downvote **posts** if you think these kinds of posts do not belong on /r/india, or if you've seen the same content being posted multiple times before. Multiple posts of a single breaking news events, million photographs of ""farmers"", and links to FB flamewars are good examples of posts which I would downvote. 

Downvote **comments** if you think it is harmful to the discussion. Rude attacks on other users, paranoid conspiracy theories, and _some_ trolls are examples of comments I would downvote. I don't like Modi, but many times I have upvoted comments which support him because many people have different opinions, and I respect that. 

###2. Redditors are real people too!
This is an anonymous internet forum, and it's easy to temporarily forget that the user you're speaking to is a real person, with family and a life and her own problems, likes and dislikes. So before you call someone an idiot, retard, chaddi, Congie, etc., please think: would you do this to a real person in your life? What makes you think it's okay to do that to people on reddit? 

###3. /r/india is mainly what users make it
A subreddit is mainly determined by what its users do. If you want more self posts, submit more, and upvote them when you see them. If you want less politics, ~~downvote~~ IGNORE politics posts, and submit and upvote more non-political content.     
If you are not okay with insults and rudeness, then leave a _polite_ reminder asking people to be more civil. Downvote only the worst comments.

----

tl;dr: The next time you feel an urge to downvote someone politely saying something about Modi, Sachin, rape, SRK, or how your hometown sucks, please DON'T. Even worse, don't insult them for their opinion. _Explain_ why you disagree, instead.  
Don't _only_ complain about content, please contribute content you would like to see. ",Reddictor," http://imgur.com/CV7pA Beta go and study or do work instead of doing timepass here. [deleted] Suggestion, please get your humor and sarcasm detectors repaired, use common sense. Arvind Kejriwal is not a redditor and will not reply to your open letter on reddit. And last, no one reads walls of text.
Jai Hind! *""These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized. ""*

you all craving for useless internet points.when you are a new user,everything is funny whatever you read in comments,then slowly you start getting involved,you start hating people that don't coincide  with you,and when enough time passes you start depending on this forum for your daily doze of dopamine.

That's institutionalized.  Totally support Reddictor on this one . As a matter of fact, didn't even downvote [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/18ihz4/only_indian_english_should_be_official_language/c8fckto)


Also I would like to see these posts coming up from senior mods...ok...???


Junior ka harassment nahi chalega  I would never call anyone a chaddi. Don't insult opinions. That should be put on r/india's front page.  Aaaand every single post on this thread is drowning in downvotes.

Fighting a losing battle here, reddictor. For the point about wanting less of a particular topic, you can implement the submission flair system such as in /r/DotA2 

You can filter out all the topics you don't want and keep the ones you do using RES. > million photographs of ""farmers""

LOL at Lolguard We are approaching an election, and people are polarised. When that happens, downvotes on differing POVs are impossible to stop.

Largely, our discussions are not from positions of real knowledge. I personally respect opinions from some solid right-wingers and never downvote them, and I suspect there are some Modi supporters who upvote stuff that looks knowledgeable enough even though they don't like it. However, largely, if both sides see the opinions as from ignoramuses, downvotes cannot be helped.

I personally always downvote a user with a *gaali* in his username. Very rarely, some of them actually turn out to post a real comment, and then with reluctance, I upvote them but this is rare.

You can only disagree with those who you respect. With others you look down upon, who wants to spend time explaining why you disagree (as you are sure that they won't get it?). Hence the downvotes from both sides.

I personally have seen serious discussions here, where the quality was such that (for both sides of the argument) that I have sat back and watched, and upvoted everyone. However that has been rare.

I suspect there are very intelligent commenters from all sides here, but most of them stay quiet. Then you have the loudmouth idiots from all sides running riot. Aside from this discussion, why have you guys made the submit button as a self post submission by default? Thank you for the healthy reminder (or in some cases, the first time anyone has seen these). This sub seems so immature sometimes, I hope this helps.  The biggest problem is the r/bakchodi subreddit leaking on to rIndia. That will definitely turn off new redditors. I was happy to find r/bakchodi but it is sad that many of them post on to r/India for no reason with stupid comments and troll like crazy on r/India with stupid posts or stupid comments.  [deleted] [This comment of mine about Modi got 12 downvotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/18l0ag/markandey_katju_says_electing_modi_in_2014_would/c8fpehv?context=3), but not a SINGLE rebuttel to any of the five points I had made (shiv52 came out with a misunderstanding, but he still got more upvotes than me). Everyone who downvoted me, or any comment, without saying why, are making this subreddit the shitty place that it is.  tl dr - if i say burp then downvote.. but dont downvote this particular comment... get it? I've always found /r/india to be a very civilized place. There are much worse subreddits than this one.

 Can we have a marriage meta post where people can post about arranged marriage and love marriage and marriage related stuff? There is a marriage related post once a week at least and most of the comments are generic, it would be great that we can sticky it, so people can refer to it before posting? * As for point #3, a subreddit is determined by what content is promoted.
* Promotion can happen several ways, but as you suggest, content submission is the first step to content promotion.
* After that happens, one of the primary modes of promotion on Reddit is by way of what posts get a lot of net upvotes. 
* Alternately moderation can help what content gets promoted, and what simply ""disappears"".


As to what can be made to disappear via moderation: 

1. **Content that is in poor taste:** Although content (including posts and comments) might be in poor taste, such as being abusive. Some people here like such content and will upvote it. Left unmoderated, such content will be promoted and decide the direction the sub-reddit takes.

2. **Duplicate content:** Posts that link to the same article on the same issue are blatant reposts. But posts linking to alternate articles on the same issue too are in a way a duplicate and end up splitting the discussion into separate threads. Not only blatant reposts, but posts linking to alternate articles too should be removed via moderation (at least within a given time period, say ~24 hour). The submitter should be requested to instead post the alternate article in the existing thread. The same argument could be extended to comments. Please don't post multiple comments mentioning the same point of argument, upvote the existing comment that is consistent with your argument, and if you'd like to add something, add so as a reply to the parent comment. This however should be left out of the purview of moderation.  

A note on moderation:  

* I'm sure many of you believe that moderation is akin to infringement on freedom of speech, and have hence been vehemently against moderation on /r/india 
* However, reddit communities are not the same as countries. If users feel that their freedoms are being stifled, that they are not being heard on /r/india or any other community, they are welcome to create their own community with their own guidelines to promoting content they believe is apt for the community.

The last point above brings me to my concluding remark: Some moderators of /r/india have engaged and continue to engage in a form of domain squatting, by creating sub-reddits with names that have a potential to be an active reddit community in future. The intent could either be to moderate such sub-reddits as well, or to prevent the creation of sub-reddits whose interests might clash with that of /r/india 's and hence diverting traffic. I sincerely request you to stop doing this. **We don't need no education**

**We don't need no class control**

**Hey teacher ! leave them kids alone** next AMA request : **Kapil Sibal**

Please.

(the rules do make a lot of sense) This is a chootiya post.  Not trolling, but why do you think Gujarat...That was the name of the post  that was posted about a day ago and I had replied to a comment posted there. You will find my comments and the replies I got from a redditor there. I' d like you(the moderators) to take a look. She did not rebut even one point but made a few personal attacks. I remained civil but the personal attacks were uncalled for.Her perception of me is of a Modi fan boy and therefore anything I say will fall on deaf ears.  [deleted] ~~Shut up you idiot cuntnigger fuckbastard~~
Honestly, don't get all moral police here. We're bad sometimes, yes, but I'd like to reserve the right to call someone a retard when I'd like to. I would definitely call them that to their face, if they said the things they do to my face.

EDIT: I get downvoted on my opinion on a post telling people not to downvote on opinion. Really? Umm... why single out politics post? Any valid reason to be apolitical for us please? Everyone is always rady far fraandship. silly thread.  Is the schoolmaster telling us how to behave in school ?  Anti Modi Secular brigade operates several handles, not all of them post but they do upvote all posts where Modi/BJP is questioned. 

Detailed and well thought out posts with even a slight hint of being pro Modi/BJP are downvoted as illustrated by cumnovember's post.

Even if you (mods) remove the downvote button from css, these people will disable the theme in RES and downvote.

edit: A radical solution will be to separate /r/India and /r/Indianpolitics [deleted] What about the pakis? those sobs keep lurking here hunting for any anti-paki link or comment and attack with full might of downvote button though their multiple aliases.

[R]Political Threads - A new way forward,0,2rv4tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2rv4tw/rpolitical_threads_a_new_way_forward/,462,"Greetings /r/india
 
Over the last few years we have seen a steady growth of subscribers. This has brought in great participation and some unpleasant behavior. To combat the latter, we have implemented a detailed set of rules and added members to our team to help enforce them. This has resulted in a much better place to discuss ideas without being threatened physical harm.
 
However, this still gives a few people room to circumvent rules and indulge in low-effort comments that meant purely to rile other users or to insult people of a certain religion or political belief. So going forward, we'd like to elevate the state of discussions on this sub.
 
For the next 3 weeks, as an experiment, **all** political and Religious threads will be [Rediquette enforced](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/reddiquette) by default. We Indians love to talk about politics and no one can take that away from us. What we do ask is that people put a little more thought into what they say, so that /r/india is a little better place to talk than the rabid comments section of the Times Of India. Incidentally, this was one of the changes requested in the feedback thread by a few people.
 
What will be blocked in the comments
 
* Slurs
 
* Invectives such as ""seculars/sanghis/bhakts/*tards/communal"" - this list is not complete, but serves as an example. Armchair lawyers trying to circumvent this, please don't take this as a challenge but understand where we come from and cooperate.
 
* Low-effort comments such as ""Lol what can you expect from these fascists/rightwingers/leftists"". Make a point, but put some thought into it.
 
 
What will still be allowed in the comments (as long as they don't belong to the categories above)
 
* Sarcasm, jokes and humor - make jokes about apparel all you want, just put some effort into it
 
* Memes
 
 
Quite simply put, we're trying to enforce the [No Asshole rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No_Asshole_Rule). If this trial period succeeds, we will make the changes permanent.

You can help us out by reporting comments that do not belong to political threads.
 
Thank you for your participation and we look forward to building a better community and dream of a 24 hour period where we won't be asked to fornicate ourselves.",i_am_not_sam," [removed] This is rubbish. There is no evidence that the rules have been effective. Just the makers of the rules saying so. Now you want to control discourse and stifle organically grown conversation. 

Show us some numbers. Bring some accountability to the mods. Getting sick of you guys shoving your holier than thou attitude down our throats. We make this subreddit not you. For shame. Mods don't do this ....don't enforce such moderation on discussions....in your effort to improve the discussion quality the no of people who participate will go down ....I am a lurker most of the times and love to read what other people have said even the lazy comments and their reactions because it brings out a chuckle and makes the conv light hearted ....and when I do comment ...I may not make a strong justified point but I say what I think about the topic ....these rules that you are planning as experimental will totally dissuade people like me who come to this sub to enjoy reading conversations and read up on crowd curated news. I have been on this sub for a year and became active a coupe of months back ...but too many rules and moderation are taking away the fun of actively participating in the sub On one hand we criticize the fact that Freedom of Speech guaranteed under Article 19 is qualified by exceptions. Not a day passes when we do not criticize the Government for perceived stifling of free speech. Indians as it is have to think twice about airing controversial and offensive speech in real life. Internet is the only place left where we can speak our mind under the cloak of anonymity. And with every passing month the stupid rules of r/India are taking away chunks from even this little freedom we have.

Why are people offended if I use 'secular' in a sarcastic manner to identify a political ideology? How is calling a group 'bhakts' contrary to healthy functioning of this sub? People are supposed to have thick skin on the internet. What are we? A group of seventy year olds who need to preserve morality and civility everywhere we go?

This sub draws traffic not because of its rules or moderation. It draws traffic simply because someone was able to squat on the url 'http://www.reddit.com/r/India'. You change all the moderators and remove all the rules and the sub will still continue to draw the same amount of traffic. What is the need for so many rules then? Is it because a particular group of users want the discourse to take place only as per their liking? Because the Rule Section of this sub has alrady started to mirror Indian statutes - bulky and devoid of common sense. And it doesn't help when moderators insist on strict interpretation of rules in all cases and under all circumstances. This has often resulted in absurd post titles being allowed and minor deviations removed. We now have a situation where a twitter link to a verified account of Rakhi Sawant is all right but if one were to link to a non-verified account of Sudheendra Kulkarni the post will be removed unless we censor it out!

If you want to do something better for this sub take up the responsibility of creating 'stickies' for occasions where there is a possibility of a large number of user threads cropping up. Get a few nice people to do AMAs. Improve upon the CSS. And please remain in the background instead of making these monthly ""Hello! We are your mods. This is how we are going to talk going forward"" threads.
 **MODS, Y U TAKE FUN OUT OF /r/india???**

We already have a Serious Discussion Tag. If the OP wants to have a serious discussion on the topic, they could mark it so. The [R] should not be forced unnecessarily.

**PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE SO BETA TO GET OFFENDED BY WHAT IS SAID ON THE INTERNET.** > Invectives such as ""seculars..

Heheh.. Mission accomplished! So the era of [deleted] begins This is in my opinion a move based on poor judgement. No Asshole Rule is meant for the workplace not Reddit. Reddit is a self-pruning system where the wisdom of the crowd will kill the bad and nourish the good. The crowd has the power to decide what is good and bad. Somebody underestimated both the power of Reddit as a platform and the wisdom of the crowd.

Shameful. What about, lol, you are lolguard? Are those comments allowed? Looks like I am back in School with a monitor assigned to note the roll numbers of friends/fellow students with even a slight noise of coughing or murmuring.

Not a new way forward - but backward.

Whatever man! You're the Monitors - do what pleases you. Yaar abhi to purane rules poori tarah se yaad nahin hue the, ab aur bana diye ... :( Prediction: In a couple of hours you would be like 'Yaar, what were we thinking?' This is too much censorship. And besides under the above definition what counts as 'low effort comments' will be extremely subjective depending on the mod and his/her moods and biases and there will be no consistency in terms of action taken. Thank God /r/india is not a country.  you guys should start a randia facebook group instead of killing reddit experience. reddit is not for kids and the anonymity is the thing which brings us here. if I can't call retard a retard, then I don't know what I should be doing here. What can I expect from hitler mods. 

tldr; no asshole rule is stupid. Not enough moderation - yeah that's what's the problem with this subreddit. why not just remove low effort comments or comments targeting users with slurs? otherwise slurs should be accepted because freedom of speech. sometimes in the flow of a post people might just get into rant mode and as long as the comment is not directly attacking users, i think it should be allowed  Is there anymore rules sire?

North Korea would be so proud today ...now we can't be sarcastic...every comment doesn't need  to have a strong point...can't we even vent our  frustrations by jokes?

This whole thing reminds me on carlins take on being politically correct all the time >understand where we come from

and where do you come from exactly ? Is doing 10 pushups before calling someone a retard considered enough of an effort?

>Quite simply put, we're trying to enforce the No Asshole rule 

Will that leave us with no mods? I sure wouldn't like this sub to turn into a cesspool. Without hardworking mods, what will be left ;) here?

I agree with you though. This couldn't have come at a better time. We need to show solidarity with the Charlie Hebdo attackers. They fought for the death of freedom of speech and I am glad to see someone take up their fight. 

I don't get this funda of removing words like Sanghis, tards, bhakts. Where am I going to go after Kejriwal gets a drubbing by Modi again?

With a net upvote of 3 I think we can all this experiment a success and enforce Reddiquette immediately.

Heil! Idiotic and inviting more donkey work for you if you are a mod.  Freedom of speech and expression ka kya hua? Perfect timing I must say This is yet another subjective law that you are trying to bind the users with. 

What if somebody uses slurs or low effort comment as sarcasm and you don't get the sarcasm?  Please also block all ""wheres our 15 lakhs "" comments  So 'but  what about 2002'  type comments will be banned? Just a suggestion - can we create megathreads for ongoing controversies  ? (Like say the ""conversion"" debate). 90% of the shitposts happen when there is heated controversy going on. 

Putting all submissions on that topic to one thread will help a lot of us steer away from it [deleted] So I can't do this, ""lol""  >Quite simply put, we're trying to enforce the No Asshole rule.

Yeah why not, start with yourself. Not going to comment on the rules, other than there are too many. If anyone is looking for a sub with minimal moderation, I have created /r/india_unmod 

Obviously I don't expect entire junta to pack their bags and leave /r/india, but if you want to discuss or post something with minimal restrictions, do visit. Anarchists, hypocrites. Killing the very motive of Reddit.  If this Nanny behavior is really made permanent, it may be time for all of us to shift to a new India subreddit.  I appreciate the effort to moderate but dont delete jokes and memes. Let them be and instead go after only slurs and hatred. Repeat offenders should be blocked only and not everyone. This experiment might be a bit controversial but i hope you change some aspects later.  So, is sarcastic use of the word ""secular"" allowed or not? We come here for entertainment and fun , you're making this place boring /u/raktha_sindhuram is right,  this is not the official sub of india, why are you applying ""workplace"" rules here Just Idiotic on your parts,Lets see where this takes us. [removed] Really you call this a ""way forward"" ?? this decision feels like mods here are some 13 year olds with internet. > Low-effort comments. 


lol seriously! 

> You can help us out by reporting comments that do not belong to political threads.


Yeah good luck with that. Guys /r/india is the reddit's North Korea now Dude, I appreciate your attempt but you're taking all the fun things (at least for me) away by blocking memes/jokes/humour/sarcasm/low effort comment. And ""effort"" is such a vague thing, who'll decide? Can't we just keep all the comments in bad taste away or comments that have score less than ""-10""?

Many times, there are political posts that don't even have anything worth seriously discussing, but worth upvoting for visibility. For example, see [this post](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2rtujn?sort=confidence). But what about  ~~black bitch~~ 2002? Are such comments allowed? The whole essence of R\India will be lost now. Height of moderation. Oh boy! I am lost with words. Why not ban ""right winger"" or inserting the word ""kulcha"" like a meme, If you are going to ban ""secular"" ?

Alternatively how am I supposed to call out people with all too well known idealogies and agendas ? You Mods did not have the 'time' to put up a 'Best of 2014' thread. Why enforce additional rules pulled out of your collective ass?  [deleted] It sure took you guys a lot of time to stop being lil b's Sounds good. Has the process already started ? I am not a fan of many of you mods, but today I welcome this move. Hopefully this filtering will lead to better content and quality participation. Cheers! > What will be blocked in the comments

> Invectives such as ""seculars/sanghis/bhakts/*tards/communal"" - this list is not complete, but serves as an example. Armchair lawyers trying to circumvent this, please don't take this as a challenge but understand where we come from and cooperate.

> Low effort comments such as ""Lol what can you expect from these fascists/rightwingers/leftists"". Make a point, but put some thought into it.

Excellent stuff. As bummed as I am imagining it's going to take the fun out of this sub, this is needed. Every other thread I check out these days is full of bait - right/left/xyz wing or religion. This is *needed*, but may be no one wants it.

Thanks based mods, may the 4s be with you. Good move but I'll tell you what's gonna happen. A lot of comments will be deleted and the commenters will claim it was because of their inclination towards a certain political party/religion and not because the comment was shit and broke the rules. I stopped commenting on any such threads. only upboats and downboats. heuheuheu Make it so that the low effort users get bored and leave, just like when they are gifted a good book or shown a thought provoking film. > Over the last few years we have seen a steady growth of subscribers. This has brought in great participation and some unpleasant behavior.

Why don't you mods grow a pair and stop whining about 'some unpleasant behaviour'?

In my opinion, this extreme attitude towards modding has resulted in a lot of users being turned away from this sub.

Just the other day one of my posts was banned saying 'this belongs on r/bakchodi'. Seriously? Is it liberal to censor? Or does being liberal equal support of free speech? Is there a way to allow users to hide the low effort comments rather than completely ban them?

To illustrate, I find the RES ignore feature quite useful.  Once I realize a user often post low effort comments, I simply ignore them. Encouragement of good practices are better then any kind of law enforcement. That being said, this place is beginning to suck more and more everyday. How many new rules since 2011? And the level of interaction has not improved much in last 3 years tbh.

tl;dr Won't be participating in Political threads any more because I have put too much effort to get the karma that I have and don't want to see it go to waste just because some mod with his/her attitude problems decides to use a ban hammer.

 > Low effort comments such as ""Lol what can you expect from these fascists/rightwingers/leftists"". Make a point, but put some thought into it.

A low effort comment is still a comment. Not everyone has the time, or the ability to put up very articulate comments. This *does not* mean their opinion is invalid. The up/down votes exist for resolving low effort and high effort posts and these should be relied upon.

The others I think are OK. So much fucking this! About time you idiots fix this shithole. Holy shit I'm sick and tired of constant bickering in serious threads.

To people who make these comments:

FUCK OFF, no seriously. Nobody cares about your stupid insecurities. Either you get an opinion and learn how to articulate it like an educated person or you shut the fuck up. It's a very simple rule. 

Ask yourself these questions before posting a comment: 

* Am I stupid? 
* Do I lack comprehension skills?
* Do I get a boner at the mere sight of a politician / or reference to a God?
* Am I ashamed of being wrong and cannot tolerate someone correcting me ?

If answers to **any** of the above is YES, do us all a favor: go to C:\Windows and delete System32 folder.

PS: Linux users can do `sudo rm -rf /`

PPS: **DON'T try this at home**

 *Arre yaar*, why should you ban the word secular ?  

Sangh is a totally non violent, peaceful, egalitarian, non religious, cultural and volunteer driven organization which has done lot many things for this country and this country's cows. Or not. But the point is why should *Sanghi* be taken as an abuse. It is literal meaning is the ""member of the Sangh"". 

Do the leftist, fascist, pol pot smoking/worshipping, Marxist, Maoist, Leninist, Trotskyist mods believe that the membership of such organization is equivalent to invocation of invectives ? 

But seriously, why ban these words ?  It's high time. I know many friends who are redittors but stay away from /r/india because of the political and recently religious posts. Heck, even I didn't subscribe to /r/india when I first joined reddit. Hope the trial works out well.  [removed] Thanks for doing this. I've been a lurker for most of the time that I've been on reddit, getting active only in the past 3-4 months when I've had time.

The one thing I have noticed that distinguishes posts on the frontpage versus that on /r/india is the quality of discussion. People actually seem to talk to each other/converse on the other international sub-reddits that I am subscribed to. Here, people seem to *need* to take sides. Accepting even that, given that this is politics in India, there is this drive to *prove* oneself right at all costs, which I feel severely detracts from any quality in the discussion. Nobody is willing to listen or cede a few points so that his/her own position can be considered on its merit.

There is rarely anything to learn from each other - in terms of style of debate, discussion, bringing an insight to the thread etc. Sad. I've always felt that we could do so much more.

It's almost as if we are fighting an election/political battle here - which is **not**, IMHO, the place for it. I've lost my cool a couple of times and regret it. I've vowed not to let it random comments affect my equanimity henceforth.

We all want India to change. We all want its citizens to do great and magnificent things. Could we start off by putting in some mindfulness and thought into our comments on political and religious threads, please? Just be nicer to each other. Let's not become the Ugly Indian here as well.

Apologies for the length. Sorry!

Edit: Donwvoted for making a case for basic decency on a reddiquette-enforced thread? Should I be surprised? Thanks to the mods for the effort you are putting into it.  You'll always have people who criticize.  Some of them have genuine points, and are helpful, but most are ... assholes.   I had unsubscribed from this sub due to all the bullshit comments. I'm glad you're doing this. Circlejerk may be shifted to other places. I hope this sub becomes atleast closer to the discussions at /r/worldevents or /r/geopolitics. Keep up the good work. There really is no other place for quality discussions on India in various issues.

One suggestion: while deleting a comment you can post a reply saying whIch rule it broke. You can make a standard list of formatted replies you can copypaste. So the child will be there and people can see what happened. If you think it's worth it, may be you can even quote part of the original comment. >Invectives such as ""seculars/sanghis/bhakts/*tards/communal"" 


THANK YOU MODS! I love you! This is an amazing decision. :D These words have fucked up actual discussion more times than I can count in this place. It's like beating a dead horse and dumping it on the same road everyday for everyone to see. I hope the changes become permanent.

>Low-effort comments such as ""Lol what can you expect from these fascists/rightwingers/leftists"". Make a point, but put some thought into it.

This will be unpopular among those who have nothing else to contribute, but those guys will always have randianoos.

Good work, mods. These changes are unpopular, but they're going to be really good for discussion in the long run. :) Did I make the first upvote? [100% agree.

"[AskIndia] If the number/population of Hindoos and Muslims were to be exchanged in this country, how different do you think would be the socio-economic condition of the minority ?",17,3wxhp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3wxhp5/askindia_if_the_numberpopulation_of_hindoos_and/,34,"Yes I had made a similar thread yesterday but the mods deleted it for being ""communal flamebait"" and yes I do agree that I had framed it a bit in a communal fashion but I was also looking for some serious discussion also and after looking at some of the answers yesterday I'm even more curious for the discussion

So this time I have framed the question in a neutral manner and have also marked the thread ""reddiquette"" so I hope the mods won't delete it and we can see what the people of this sub think about it

According to Wikipedia Hindu people make up 79.8% of the population and Muslim people make up 14.2% of the population in this nation

Now if the demographic situation was to be reversed, meaning Muslim (79.8%) and Hindu (14.2%), what do you think would be the  socio-economic condition of the people of the minority religion and non religious community

Wikipedia page which shows the religious demography of India

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_India

Also how different do you think would the conditions be in the North East and bordering nations like Nepal,Tibet(China),Myanmar and Sri Lanka(I know it's not a land border but still)",fresh69fresh," What minority ? no minorities here.  I guess it would be a poorer and less developed version of an Arab country like Saudi. Quite similar to how Pakistan is now. There are already lots of Muslim majority countries you can look at to see how it would be socio-politically. I would guess Hindus will be greatly reduced over the years. Like it happened in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The country will become dangerous in no time. Minorities i.e. non-muslims will definitely be second class citizens as in almost all islamic nations.  

Minorities will not have freedom of religion as in almost all islamic nations.  

Minorities will not be able to cry about intolerance because intolerance will not be as big of an issue as will be protection of Islam.

In short, if this nation ever has more Muslims then there won't be all the randirona about secularism. One of the commentators yesterday said 

>It depends what the socio-economic conditions of Muslims are. If they are as well of as they are now, it'll be a disaster and a fodder for fundamentalism and communalism. If they are exactly as the Hindus are now, it'll be difficult to say. Maybe, there will be greater Hindu fundamentalism, maybe there is soft-Mulsim majoritarianism.

To which I replied

>Is the social economic conditions of Muslims in Pakistan and Bangladesh similar to the situation of Hindus in India ?
I believe it is. But I can't provide any stats got it
Do you know about it ? 

Now since the thread got deleted I couldn't get any response from the person so I hope this ""reddiquette"" thread might help
 Once they are a majority (more than 50%), the tides will turn for the worse. It will become Pakistan. Simple. Islamists would try to kill all the Hindoos but Hindoos will fight back, there will be civil war.  [removed] Depends on the date switch. Pre-colonial era then probably more conflict with china. Colonial era? Well judging by the way Britain dealt with Islamic areas India would be poorer. There would also have been independent sikh and hindu states set up on independence. 

Cold war? With that many extra muslims around locally the mujahideen in Afghanistan would have been far less influence by Arab fighters.  This is a loaded and controversial question, because the answer that forms in most of our minds is not likely to sound pleasant and saying so would make us look biased and bigoted, when we are just saying something that seems a bitter truth.

That answer is that like in most Muslim majority countries today including our immediate neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh, minorities would find their lives a LOT harder than they do in our India. If anything.. we will make strong case for the annexation of Bangladesh and Pakistan.  You know what the problem with such 'what if' questions is? You can never go into enough depth to where a suitable reason can be reached as to how such a switch would make sense.

Why are there more Muslims than Hindus? When did it happen? What other effects did it have on history? 

There are thousands of such questions we can never answer in any meaningful way which makes the whole exercise pointless क्या होता तो क्या होता ? How anyone could know.
Are we astrologers.

Greetings /r/Indians Old and New: A word about comment score hiding feature,37,1jq5iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1jq5iv/greetings_rindians_old_and_new_a_word_about/,184,"Hello /r/india,

I feel we got off on the wrong foot here. I can narrate the series of events which led to this miscommunication but it’ll be in vain. Over the past week we realized that there is a major communication gap between the users and certain moderation initiatives we have under taken. To be precise I am talking about the ‘comment score hiding’ feature test initiated by mod /u/rahulthewall 2 days ago. The feature was introduced to the mods by reddit admins a couple of months ago and since then a lot of communities have tested and implemented it successfully. We realize that there are a number of new users in /r/india and reddit in general who do not understand what this feature means or what it is supposed to achieve. In fact a lot of old users also seem to be either confused about its utility or are against it for their own valid reasons.

I would recommend that the community read the following links to know more about this feature and then discuss its relevance in /r/india in the comments of this thread.

• **[Voting on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting)** 


• **What is comment score hiding?** : Minutes to hide comment scores is a subreddit setting accessible to moderators of a subreddit. If set, comments in the subreddit will have their score hidden for the specified number of minutes, after which the score will appear as normal. For example, if set to ""60"", any comments less than an hour old will not show their score. Voting still behaves normally, and behavior of the page will not otherwise be affected (best/top sorting will still use the scores, comments with score less than the user's threshold will be collapsed, etc.), but the comment's actual score will not be visible until it is at least that many minutes old. [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/)

• **Goal**: The goal of this feature is to try to reduce the initial bandwagon/snowball voting, where if a comment gets a few initial downvotes it often continues going negative, or vice versa. By hiding the score for a while after posting, the bias of seeing how other people voted on the comment should be greatly reduced.

Some other notes about how this feature works:
 - The maximum for the setting is 1440 minutes (24 hours). 
- Scores will remain visible to moderators (and admins). 
- Scores will also be hidden for RES users, mobile users, etc. (will display as the comment having the default 1 point in mobile clients)

• **General Reddit Feedback**: The community opinion is largely divided about this feature, but many subs have found it extremely useful. [Further Reading](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1e0dyz/moderators_general_feedbackfollowup_for_the_new/) 

Some users have reacted more negatively than others and accused the moderators of being on some sort of a power trip. Please be assured that every action we take here is to make the community better. We spend all day keeping your subreddit free of a variety of innovative spam, shameless self promotion, page-view mongers, porn among others things. We make sure that your real identities are secure and that no one incites a witch hunt against another user and that things never escalate to a level where the subreddit gets banned or hot listed. If you ever have any questions or need clarifications (heck we’ve even answered questions about comment formatting) about any aspect of /r/india then please feel free to write to us on [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia). Our response time is pretty quick usually; those of you who have written to us or who write to us regularly can vouch for it.

**Next step**:

• It is our suggestion that the feature be kept active for another 5 days to complete at least a week of testing. (The ideal testing time is usually 2 weeks)

• The poll will be active for the entire duration of the test and we will announce results at the end of the week.

• This is the Official Community discussion thread on the ‘comment score hiding feature’. Please put your point across in a civil manner, use your vote wisely and don’t downvote just because you disagree.

• **[Take the doodle poll](http://doodle.com/yzqqd5fyh87kktpn), and register your official vote.**

It is my suggestion to the moderation team to keep their interaction on this thread to a minimal [except answering questions directed at us]. The community has heard from us; let’s hear what the readers have to say. I encourage /r/Indians to upvote this thread for maximum visibility and use their votes and comments in a civil manner without getting into rage fights with other users.

 Comment
 score hiding is a bad idea here.

> While it's intended to decrease a bandwagon effect, it actually creates a much stronger bandwagon effect toward early commenters in a thread. Those commenters are the first to have their post scores un-hidden and they are the ones rising to the top even more sharply than they did before.
Early commenter advantage was always a skew in the system, but this makes it much worse. This is snowballing pretty quick. Why can't we guys just lay off for few days and then vote on this issue? Right now everyone is worked up so much that they wont be voting rationally. That is just my thought.

As I said in AMA thread. Comment hiding in /r/india is bad idea because there is no definition of what is an appropriate comment here. 

Comment score hiding in /r/games worked out because mods got in and started removing low effort comments. I am for comment score hiding if it is backed by some new rules. Request all the regulars to participate in this thread. Based on the overall vibe & feedback we receive here today, few decisions will be made [Of course, we would keep you updated before implementation]  My question: what was broken in rIndia that this feature fixes? moderators are doing everything except they really meant to do. Wait you guys moderate away porn! 

Why?!!

 Screw comment score hiding, I want to discuss this porn angle.  > Greetings r/Indians

No wonder, all moderation make sense now. Two things.

1) Comment hide should have been told to the community beforehand.

2) The duration of the time was 6 hours, then 2, now it's 3, I guess. It's idiotic, in my opinion. An hour is good enough time. What is 2,3 or 6 hours going to achieve that an hour wouldn't. And besides if I were to sort the comments by top, best, controversial etc, I'd know which ones are upvotes and which ones aren't.

Can we please revert back to the older days.

people do have the tendency to downvote/upvote a certain comment that does not fall under the purview of their ideology. But then that'd be too anal to have the 'hide comments' feature exclusive for that.
And since this is an internet forum, and nothing good comes out of free internet points, I don't see a reason why the comments should be hidden. If anyone has a different opinion that is largely different from the most upvoted comment, they can well state it and open up a discussion.
But it's good that we tested this new feature. Now we know it doesn't work at all in this sub. In subreddits I frequent comment hiding has had a positive effect. I do not understand why people are so upset about not knowing for a few hours how others are voting; I mean, I vote based on the content that I read and not because of how others have voted.

Thanks for this post and clarifying your reasons. I do believe that your intentions are right and there is no harm in testing features. I do not like the comment score hiding feature because it does not make a difference in this sub. It has made no difference at all in my voting behaviour and probably others too.  I find this annoying because of the way I browse reddit. I use reddit mostly in its text form, reading and quickly skimming through the comments and the score giving me a slight idea of the populatity of the comment, which has nothing to do for *my* perception of it. It is another statistic against a comment with the score, time posted and time edited.

Moreover, the maximum number of comments on any given post doesn't happen to be more than 100-200 on average, which ensures that even the downvoted comments are very much visible. This is unlike the massive comment threads in /r/askreddit or other default subs, where initial voting can result in a comment moving by hundreds of comments up or down.

I can not even disable this feature if I want to. I do not like the new style changes, and any subreddit's style in general, because again, I browse to read text, not the pictures. I can disable that and read the text, but not such a feature.
 _looking at the length of the post_

Ah, our moderators are one of us.

They also have no life. 

 I hate (sorry Cable guy) the hidden score system. I don't have the fucking time or energy to read through all the comments. I come to /r/india for some fun and the fun is directly linked to the comments.

Some would say why is this an issue as the comments are still ranked. It is a fucking big issue as I don't wish to read the comments which have a low positive or negative score. I would rather concentrate only on the comments with a large positive or negative score. Those are the comments which provide insights or lulz. I don't want to be bothered by the mediocre comments.

Once the scores are hidden there is no way to differentiate which are the worthy comments.

 Modame, I love you in the same breath as I hate you.


1. We are handful of users on /r/india, up vote count on a post/comment doesn't really change the dynamics of the popularity of the post. It gets influenced on subreddits where active users count is very high, that is, thousands of active users per hour. 

2. Majority of the posts on /r/india concerns around politics, on such posts our votes goes to the username and not what he or she has posted, because we know already that users political inclination. 

3. The general posts are up voted depending upon the quality of the content posted. And that is good. If you feel otherwise - please share some good posts that are not up voted on r/india? 

4. By hiding comments or even thinking of this feature you have only wasted time and added drama. A lot of you mods are nothing but jokers, apart from /u/neoronin no one else is doing a job properly. OP - Doesn't matter how shitty you are at moderating, /r/india is keeping you because to prove our secular gender credentials. Heard about reservation? You are a proof of why our country sucks. You must talk to that chootya kapoor to give you some work in her family drama serials. 

6. If at all you guys want to help, you should do things to promote /r/india to get your family, friends, mates and colleagues up here.

  Let me just say mod /u/rahulthewall is an asshole. I don't know why I say that except that seems to be the appropriate thing to say in these threads. (Fairly new here. Trying to fit in. No offense /u/rahulthewall.) Not for nothing that we are called ""The Argumentative Indians"". Let the mods feel happy if they want. For me, this one is a non-issue. I think I and for the change. I don't see why it would be a bad idea, but I sure can see how it will be a good thing. Now we have two polls http://metareddit.com/r/YesNo and http://doodle.com/yzqqd5fyh87kktpn

You make all of this so confusing.

Source for the first one: http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1jpwxl/do_you_support_the_practice_of_hiding_comment/ I will present a view opposite to most here. Let's implement this feature for the subreddit. 

My reasons?

* We have already seen a similar feature in place for posts. Why not comments?
* A lot of comments in r/india dwell on arguments. The bandwagon effect really comes into play when two people are presenting opposing views back and forth. The feature can potentially prevent this.he 
* Better formed comments will get better scores. Often, sensational and some snarky comments get upvoted to the top purely because of the bandwagon effect.

This being said, how long the comments should be hidden is really debatable. I would say 24 hours.

Also, I agree with most posters that the way the 'testing' was introduced to the subreddit was wrong. There should have been a sufficiently visible announcement. Also, the refusal of mods to admit the same (that it was wrong) is annoying.

 Let me add some comments about the mods

i find envia not fit to be a mod. a lot of his/her comments are immature.

and we have 7 mods. why ? i have seen only couple of ones active. good job, envia and rest of the mod teams! Much appreciated for informing the masses here on r/India! 

I hope to see this feature being added as a positive change! 

cheers! I do not care about score hiding, but I want downvote arrow removed. Do I want comment score hiding ? - Unsure, willing to wait for a week or so with the scores hidden to see how it feels. 

Post Deletion and Censorship - Mods on this sub have mostly been fair and leniant when it comes to censorship and such things, they allow pretty much everything to fly by and I once again ask them to continue in this vein.

Now two incidents have raised this certain aspect of modding, first time it was something related to what was considered ""generic"" i.e not related to India. At some level the Mods were right on this, in my opinion if the person really wanted to just share the image and raise debates and discussions on it he could have simply made a self post and be done with it, it would not have taken anything away from the debate, his post would not have been deleted etc.. I think it all boiled down to the currency of Reddit i.e karma.

But the second one is the one I have serious issues with. Now the Mods at some level have to act if they keep on receiving complaints about certain posts and users, fine with it. But and excuse my caps WHO THE FUCK IS COMPLAINING TO THE MODS?? Who are these sensitive asshats who's precious little feelings are hurt by these goddam trolls. Mods I implore you to not to pay attention to these precious little sugarplums and refrain from any form of censorship in comments etc no matter how ridiculous they are.

Also some advice for these advocates of reporting users and their comments, GROW THE FUCK UP!!! Reporting feature is there not to protect your feelings but report serious things like Child porn, solicitation etc and next time your candy floss feelings are getting hurt because of some troll and his comments exercise some critical thinking and downvote the shits, press that minus next the username to collapse the comments, heck easiest of all ignore the pests but for god's sake stop running to the teachers every time you see someone's being an ass. *""Sheketi Tattu kahein ke""* Too irritating to see 0|0 next to everything.

I want to know what POV has what support.

Does not matter frankly in the long term either way. At the moment, its irritating to see. Also, this is precisely the opposite of a free, unmoderated rIndia and non-interfering mods, that we have liked so far. I would request the mods to reconsider this at length. There was nothing that was broken that is now going to work, and as /u/phattu points out, there is no way we will know whether this works or not.

The most controversial of subs, /r/worldnews, doesn't use this ""device"".

While you are subverting the purpose of voting (to give/get karma), you also taking away the positive reinforcement that many comment for (there's nothing wrong in commenting for karma), and also encouraging trolls. I think keeping the score hidden is a great idea.  I would just suggest that the message be changed to [scores hidden for 1 hour] to reveal the actual time that one will have to wait to see the score. Envia, neither you nor rahulthewall do not deserve to be a mod of /r/india. For people wondering why the score hidden feature exists, check [this](https://pay.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dfnku/why_are_comment_scores_hidden/). My two cents

* update the guidelines in sidebar to explicitly say ""no trolling"" (to not have discussions like earlier where a removal of comment of a questionable nature was turned into a heated debate) and a short note for ""what gets you banned""
* if at all you decide to hide comment scores, have in in incremental time spans, start with 15 mins and then increase the threshold if at all needed to test the upper limit - to gauge the usage data, and to not cause large scale unrest.  
   It is natural for people to react to change, and the larger the change, the more the expression of outrage, however natural it may seem it just works against the change and the intentions of mods - however well intentioned they might be.
* /r/indians has moved to /r/wahoostipi. Please edit the OP to reflect more proper salutation. My suggestion will be [/r/indians](/r/india) or /r/india^ns. In case you do not have ""view source"" in RES, here is how to do it `[/r/indians](/r/india) or /r/india^ns` copy just the appropriate text. I actually am okay with the score hiding but the time duration is too long. 30 minutes or 60 minutes would be much better.",Reddiquette,2013-08-05 14:27:59
"Hey r/india, I'm planning on making a sub purely meant for se[r]ious debate and discussion.. Interested?",6,5lmmmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5lmmmj/hey_rindia_im_planning_on_making_a_sub_purely/,6,"/r/debateindia 

Had started this sub a while back and even posted about it here. Unfortunately I couldn't get much traction and only a few people ended up joining, so I stopped working on it.

While /r/india is a decent place for most things, it's impossible nowadays to have any form of discussion here without having to wade through unfunny jokes, troll accounts, mass downvoting and all (no offense meant to anyone, including the mods). 

There's no real platform for good, India-centric, discussion. Facebook is... well, you know. Quora is an IIT/IIM circlejerk. Reddit can truly be an amazing place to have amazing conversations. Especially if proper reddiquette is followed (and maybe enforced?).

This is why I'm considering maybe putting up more effort and maybe resuming /r/debateindia. I'll need your help to get more mods, set the rules, and start it up.

What do you guys think? :) Any interest?",rapidgunner," I hope it grows and becomes a platform for serious discussion Subscribed.

"A small appeal, r/India",67,qk432,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qk432/a_small_appeal_rindia/,114,"*This is regarding the act of up-voting and down-voting on this subreddit.* 

Before I start, here's a link to [Rediquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). I sincerely hope all of you, at some point, have gone through it. 

Now I understand how making a post regarding the voting could seem against one of the tenets of Rediquette, but I must, at this point, emphasize that I'm saying this with concern that a community, I feel attached to, is/could be discouraging other users, existing or prospective.

Now, it is a simple observation and I'm sure most of you would agree with me when I say, for reasons unbeknownst, most comments and posts here attract lots of downvotes. With due regard to the vote-fuzzing explained by the admins, in comparison to other subreddits, I can only observe there is heavier downvoting here. At this point, if the mods or users have an alternative plausible explanation to the phenomenon, the rest of the post could be deemed pointless. 

By rediquette, which I hope is something we agree upon, the only reasons why anyone should downvote is if you find that the content to be irrelevant to the topic or against community guidelines such as posting personal information, abusive content etc. It is suggested against downvoting someone just because you disagree with them or if they are critical of your views. It's also an encouraged practice to state why you downvote someone so it acts as constructive criticism. 

Coming to the noticeable practices in r/India, 

* users attract downvotes because they present alternative views in thread which are predominantly about one topic and not inviting discourse or diatribe.
* some users attract downvotes because they have at some point, divulged their personal information like religious beliefs, regions etc and they choose to comment with a counter-view. This info. is pointed out relentlessly under the said comment and turned into an ad-hominem attack. 
* some users attract downvotes because of their handles although it might have nothing to do with the content in their comments.  
* some users have repeatedly been mass-downvoted because they are considered trolls by a lot of other users. At this point, I'd just like to point out that viewing a comment unto itself is understandably better than holding a cumulative of their opinions every time you vote. If a said 'religious troll' is making a comment about auto-rickshaws in a city, he/she is still heavily downvoted.
* grammar, quality of comment etc also attract downvotes. Please bear in mind that not all users may be very comfortable with English. 

Karma means nothing and its hardly indicative of users' seriousness here. However, while downvotes needn't be paid any heed, they can discourage serious users who don't quite mind contributing to the discussions here. As someone who has been a regular here for over two years, it's disheartening to see so many well-meaning members leave and/or repeatedly feel discouraged. 

It's only a sincere request to the various members and trolls here to give others a chance, be open to ideas and more importantly, stop discouraging other users through blatant and oftentimes abusive criticism or the quintessential downvote. 

This isn't and needn't be a serious concern to me or most people here but it's a practice that doesn't take much to follow and could only be viewed, imho, as a constructive step.

P.S. [Obligatory Indian cat picture](http://i.imgur.com/INzoO.jpg)

**EDIT:** Far from surprise, this post also has started receiving its share of downvotes. 

But more importantly, I'd like to add a point on trolling. There are some obvious troll accounts who comment on most threads. The whole exercise of trolling is to be seek negative attention. Kindly refrain from downvoting Or upvoting the said troll accounts. You're only fueling the act and that's not desirable. Please ignore and carry on.  ",kabuliwallah," Thanks for this Kabuliwallah. Hopefully, it will have a positive impact here. 

In my view, people should upvote a post/comment that they disagree with (is contrary to their belief). This way, the post could generate a healthy (hopefully) discussion and everyone would be better off.  This place is a mess and i appreciate you efforts. I was a recent victim of mass down-voting for i touched a sensitive subject. In case anyone doing it  to please i am no troll. I thought this was a safe place to talk.

Anyhow another trend. People keep posting news links and the link gets upvote/downvote based upon the reaction to the news instead of importance of the post. Just pointing out. >it's disheartening to see so many well-meaning members leave and/or repeatedly feel discouraged

I feel discouraged by the use of swear words where they are just not required, in a normal discussion. That happens in plenty here. Not everyone is used to being called mc, bc etc. I know its a part of everyday conversation among guys in India but lets keep this place a little classier than a college canteen and not assume that everyone posting is from the same background or gender. Treat people with respect. Argue or abuse only when needed.   Paka diya behenchod. If only the politicians worked as hard for the country as you work for r/india, we would be No. 1 [deleted] I wish there was an obligatory cat picture after every serious/political/heavy topic in this sub-reddit. [](/yey) Wow... just joined this sr and this place looks terrible. Please follow the guidelines of the OP. r/india is my only relief from work. Is it possible to identify the user ids who down voted the most and may be a dialogue with them will help clear the mess. >be open to ideas and more importantly, stop discouraging other users through blatant and oftentimes abusive criticism or the quintessential downvote.

U must be new here :)  > EDIT: Far from surprise, this post also has started receiving **it's** share of downvotes.

it's = it is. I did not lose it at the Indian cat picture.  Sire, I would like to know the source of that pussy pic. > ~~small~~ humongous and impossible appeal

BTW, I'll comment once more after reading it. :) You make sense, my friend. But that will not help improve anything at /r/India. Sad but true, and I really appreciate and respect your post here. After a long time we had a thread on rindia with good funny comments. 

Enjoyed it :D


Now going to sleep. Fuck off.  I had asked once, and I shall ask again. Can we change the CSS to make downvoting not as simple as upvoting? For example, when clicking on ""downvote"", a ""pop-in""(?) appears asking the down-voter to confirm that the post/comment violates rediquette. Also, the downvote button could simply be hidden away? Well dude, I just came here to tell you that damage has been done. Within this thread another dude got down voted for no reason. I simply don't care but then I got down voted for saying ""Opera & Debian FTW"", that was what you call the final nail in the coffin. All my comments in that thread discussions were down voted ""systematically"" and all were simply trying to tell some one that Debian is a good OS. What the fuck? I think /r/bakchodi is the sanest place, at least they know what they are doing. [And I said it on /r/akchodi.](/http://www.reddit.com/r/bakchodi/comments/qibn2/baye_baye_rbakchodi_n_rindia_4_invironmant/)

Anyway, bbye /r/india. A *small* appeal indeed. I would rather work than read that essay. What I don't like about r/india is that you have to write this much shit, just to get some upvotes.  Finally! somebody said it. Dunno if people are going to listen though. But an upvote for effort and initiative.  okay. i'm gonna say it. imo, excessive downboating on [/r/india](/r/india) happens for 2 reasons:

* caste sensitivity (appropriate in one culture, not in another)
* misunderstandings due to swearing (again, appropriate in one culture, but rude in another) GOod post OP.

This shit happened to me. There was this Women's Kabbadi Championship post and I just commented how women's sport based on glamor are promoted more and these people just started on this huge downvoting campaign. I mean wtf! It's not like what I said is taboo, everyone knows it's true. And then that idiot resorted to name-calling. Mother of God, what kinda shitty subreddit is this?

A Humble Request,63,k27id,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k27id/a_humble_request/,57,"This is a humble plea to all my fellow redditors in r/india and to whoever is trolling us in the name of maula and his sock-puppets.

The forum has gone through so many changes in the last year. We have grown from a small community of 3000 subs to close to 6000 subs within 8 months. 

Reddit as a community has contributed to many positive changes in the US. Look at what kleinbl00 did for youngluck, or look at communities like r/favors, r/assistance, r/randomactsofpizza and their likes. 

I'm not asking or even suggesting that r/india to do something on that level. All I'm asking for is civility in discussions and to users to stop abusing each other. 

From a community that was robust in its discussions, we have devolved into a community of name calling, hatred, trolling and religious hatred. Debates are healthy and enrich the knowledge of everyone involved if done in the right manner. But here the only response seems to insulting each other and their family members

The experiment of banning users was something that I myself was not convinced on. But I didn't have the foresight to see the limitations of it and couldn't find an another acceptable way of maintaining civility in the forum. After discussing with the new mods, we decided to implement it as they were in agreement. 

What followed was something everyone knows. I will honestly accept my mistake of banning sniperinthebushes and apologise for it. My fellow mods ensured that it was reversed and I immediately realized what I had done and unbanned him. It was purely an emotional moment when I was called names and I acted on that. I have learnt much from that episode personally and have ensured that internet abuse does not affect me anymore.

I believe that r/india as a community will not stop growing and if this uncivil behaviour continues, we may end up attracting the wrong attention towards us and the community may suffer for it. 

Now that dirtyd0ggy has gone, can we, as a community, move on to making r/india a positive forum for discussion? 

I humbly request each and every one of you and the troll brigade to please, stop the religion bashing and hatred and abuse [also the ascii goatses] and the incessant downvoting. 

Let us make r/india as an example of what goodness we are capable of from our country. 

**TLDR: Please be nice in r/india and follow reddiquette**",neoronin," [](/hehheh ""I'll try to behave."") I don't really understand how stupid and how much time these guys have on their hands. For example, this guy's, IEBGENER, single points agenda seems to be to hating anna hazare, even in totally irrelevant threads. Ofcourse, personal abuses everywhere by trolls who are not even worth mentioning. And one thread everyday about the community. And all this for about 5000 subs ? Its India for sure. Mods, maybe its time you stick to one thing, either stay in the background and let people upvote/downvote or start banning people whose only objective is trolling. 
 Now now.. [don't feel too bad](http://i.imgur.com/o4On9.jpg). 

Let us all be nice from now on.  >Now that dirtyd0ggy has gone,

Whaaaa....? When did this happen?

I just wanted to say that I would upboat you a thousand times if I could. Thanks for manning up and being so civil about it.

I know that I have said before that I am against banning users based on additional rules, but you are fully within your power to ban users like maula or an account that exists for the sole purpose of trolling. I wouldn't mind seeing more of that.

Keep up the good work. Aw you big pansy!  C'mere - let's hug it out!

Don't lose sleep over the trolling -- its been the growing pangs of a teenage subreddit that is in love with itself.  Soon we'll be off to college and having erudite discussions about the economy, culture, and other things we don't know anything about.  We'll alternately shift from being too liberal to right-wing. Then the day will come when we are all farting about the best location for flats in delhi and why youngsters aren't wearing their pants right. You might even miss the trolls then. Hear, Hear! Now that most of the trolls seem to have gone, I too hope r/India will again become a civil place for discussion.  Let me take this opportunity(and not make a brand new post for this) to apologize to Neoronin for those insults and other machinations. I was mostly pissed at the tone of the new mod and I felt that the new rules would be very restrictive and subjective in removal. I don't usually hang out on other forums so did not expect such a barrage of trolls and trolling which followed that event. I agree wholeheartedly with Neoronin that we should self-police ourselves as well.  Funniest part which I feel about trolls is that, they are weak to fire attacks and yet they flame others? Are they suicidal by nature? 

With respect to r/india, I do hope things change, I am kind of bored seeing top stories about how trolls have deleted their account. Does anyone remember when /r/india found it hard to get 3-4 comments?

Sometimes I wish for that day. My friend Neo, 

This is a great initiative. Let us try making a conscious effort for one month to be civil.  Neoronin -

Now that you have expressed so much contrition, here is some thought/advice if you will choose to heed it. And the same goes for your fellow moderators.

You can't really be a moderator and an advocate at the same time. That is why the judge can't be a lawyer in the same courtroom at the same time. But you guys are, and there is really no alternative here.

I, and I think the silent majority too likely, noticed that as soon as brownboy became a moderator, sniperinthebushes got banned. We noticed too, that dirtyd0ggy was not banned until recently. Of course, some of us must have approved of it. I am one of those who did not, but did not make a big deal out of it then.

It was easy for me (and I think, a lot of people) to link this to the content and slant of the two individuals. To put it plainly, it appeared that you and your fellows banned one who espoused an Internet Hindu viewpoint and was none too subtle about it, but ignored one that was one of ""PLU', or ""people like us"".

Now, whether you are a right- or a left- winger is none of my business. But when you put on a moderator's cap, it does become my business. And I am sure that Conde Nast does not, AFAIK, subscribe to a particular philosophy, just like any other business.

So, let's leave aside these apologies. Are you and your fellow moderators confident that you will not let your personal beliefs come in the way of your moderating activities? Can you really separate out the neoronin[M] from the neoronin? Yes, it is difficult, but then, I assume that you and your fellow moderators asked for the job.

You've done a commendable job of getting the subreddit to where it was before you took on additional moderators. Whether it continues to go that way depends on you, and exhortations to members to be civil will not cut it unless you guys face up and change.

One last thing:

About religion bashing, pointing out a particular religion's history is not bashing; calling its members crude names is. For example, pointing out that Pakistan has wiped out its minorities and is an avowedly Islamic state and drawing a correlation is not bashing. But if you are biased yourself, you will likely call it bashing though it falls short of that. I don't know where you live, but freedom of speech is protected in the U.S., and it is *uncivil* and *impolite* speech that needs this protection, not *civil* and *polite* speech. Sorry to say this, but your posting suggests that you might need to introspect on this.
 lol trolls got banned and claimed that they deleted their accounts. This is like Pakistan claiming that they won all wars =)) Respect! Gosh, I've missed so much!  

**EDIT:** Wait! I still don't know what happened! [](/notsure) I concur and appreciate your candid post. Best I can do is to do my part. And I will. Let us hope everyone will do their parts to make this a place for  intelligent discussions. Make it a rule not to post stories on religion, politics, and cricket. Watch the nastiness go down :) this doesn't make any [sense](http://i.imgur.com/oJ6X1.jpg) hey who died and made you a mod...oh never mind r/india is like r eal india then? [deleted] Can we change ""Indians"" in the sidebar to ""Inventors of Zero"" ? A tribute and a step towards a classier r/india. Scumbag moderator-Issues are appeal to Maula after he has already deleted his account and revealed his identity. >TLDR: Please be nice in r/india and follow reddiquette

Being nice is not something that is generally associated with Reddit. Reddit is not the right place for truly touchy-softy nice guys.

To control irrelevant content, please downvote it so that it goes to the bottom of the page. And to ensure that you have a bottom in the page, have better content and more contribution.

I would hate r/india to become a disciplined group of front-benchers. I myself hate teenage(mentally) losers posting bullshit but if it is in the nature of things, let us handle it the same way, Man-to-man.

 What if we come back again?
Maula's account is also deleted, proves maula and I were same.
We (maula and I) were becoming obvious with trolling and people whom we were trolling fucked us in the ass. We apologize for wasting their time and oithers' time and not putting up a good fight.

remember Indians can do anything they put their mind to after all

[Meta] Discourse in /r/India,11,2cle31,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2cle31/meta_discourse_in_rindia/,20,"I have now been here for a year or so, and find that most threads descend into name calling and attacking known posters (cutting across ideologies) for what is their perceived stance rather than what they are actually saying.

I found that threads like Fibonnaci number (TIL sub), India dropping it's claim off the coast of Bangladesh (World News) more informative in the global subs while in our dear /r/India I found the usual name calling and the eternal kulcha vs non kulcha debate.

As a suggestion could we all (again, cutting across party lines) post stuff on topic, pertinent and eschew from the pointless personal attacks? When the community gets going we generate some awesome discussions even on topics such as [AAP](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2chvdi/serious_question_to_aap_supporters_reddiquette/) or [Colonial era India] (http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2chllt/you_should_know_the_arthashastra_is_not_just_a/) (usually very polarising subjects)

Just a thought I had and wanted to hear the views of the community on the same.",DaManmohansingh," * Report comments which consist of personal attacks.
* Use reddiquette tag while making posts. While we are talking about this, I am reminded of a discussion I had with someone on a thread about Aryabhatta's calculation of Pi to 5 significant figures. He was so damn anti-kultcha that he sincerely believed that anyone can just take out a compass and a thread, draw a circle, measure its circumference, divide by the diameter and get an arbitrarily accurate measurement of pi. My protests about things like least count error, thickness of rope, difficulty of keeping a rope exactly on a curve without adding twists etc fell on deaf ears. I had to contend with cursing the poor state of physics education in the country (especially practicals).

Why am I saying this? I guess my point is that there are stupid people on both sides of the equation and just because you are opposing something stupid, doesn't make you smart. You can be anti some form of stupidity and yet be stupid in your own right. The users needs to made aware of /r/bakchodi. 
That will resolve many of the issues. 
 Yeah, discussions on /r/india have been pretty bad lately. I have never participated actively in /r/india before I created this account. But as a lurker I have been visiting this sub for more then four years. I remember there were many many informative and interesting discussions before. 

One of the problem is that people are assuming what ideology people have, and even without reading the comment, the name calling starts. One of the most disheartening thing that I saw, was that in the thread yesterday about AAP supporters, many of the comments from AAP supporters were down-voted. The thread was specifically for them to explain their view regarding AAP's activity recently. There were some very good insight into the opinions, but still, you could find many comments down-voted without any reply for explaining so. It's as if now-a-days people are just downvoting-upvoting without reading the comments just based on the username. This severely discourages the participation.

Another problem, is that people have assumed what kind of person is seating at the keyboard on other side. What I have discovered when I have started engaging with the users, is that there is no black/white thing going on. People from diverse background, has a varying opinions on society, religion, politics and economy. The political party they support, does not always define any of those opinions. Yet, people just sometimes make assumptions based on your username, and start name-calling. It really really is affecting quality of this sub.

I don't think any of this problems are in anyway reflective of India. the problem is see, is that /rindia is /r/politics, /r/religion, /r/atheism, /r/philosophy, /r/news, /r/environment, /r/AdviceAnimals ,/r/funny , /r/worldnews , /r/socialism and /r/Conservative all rolled into one. There is a lot of circle-jerking and bigotry in this subreddit. But it also exists in variying extent in all the other mentioned subreddits too. But when they are all combined in a single subreddit. Oh god. Oh my god. It's a river of venom.

I believed that this situation will feather out after the election. But it seems that a massive victory in the election has relied some of the extreme elements on the right side of political spectrum. The amount of hatred displayed in the hate-mongering threads was disgusting. And similarly, the massive victory of presumed fascists have rustled some jimmies on the left side of political spectrum, and they are not letting go any chance to call the right wingers animals.  And it seems that nobody is in a mood to stop the flame-wars. 
 As our community will mature, the quality of discourse will undoubtedly improve.  Oh, please, the TIL thread of fibonacci was filled with anti-India and Western supremacy jokes. Jokes exist because that is what people wanna do. Not many here want serious discussions, and you can't force people to do so. If you start banning joke-ish comments, then barely any discussion will remain.",Reddiquette,2014-08-04 23:16:16

[Rediquette] Want to get a healthy discussion going rearding the interpretation of The Puranas on the topic of Age of Universe.,2,300jvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/300jvs/rediquette_want_to_get_a_healthy_discussion_going/,17,"Serious Discussion. Please avoid pointless downvoting if you don't like this post and let some people, who dont have views that are same as yours or modern science, have  peaceful discussion in the name of tolerance.  
  
So, i have seen confusions around this topic, so i will divide it into two parts. First will be the part that has no confusions.  
And in the second, i will try to answer confusions with my own interpretations and understandings which come from 7+ years of studying the puranas and 'living' the life of meditation (some questions are welcome):  
  
Non-Confusion Knowledge:  
--------------------------------------------  
  
1) The Lord Brahma comes into being at the start, lives for 100 of his years, each has 360 days, each daytime = kalpa and has 1000 chaturyugas, followed by an equal length of the night.  
  
2) Pretty much soon after coming into existence, The Lord of Creation starts to create the universe. So the lifetime of his is the same as age of universe 'till it will end'.  
So to calculate the complete age and not age as of today, we have:  
100 x 360 x 1000 x 2 kalpas. The two at the end corresponds to nighttime.  
The length of a kalpa I will cover in my interpretation.  
  
3) We are midway somewhere. To be exact:  
51st year of brahma  
Xth day of brahma (my interpretation later)  
7th manvantara  
28th chaturyuga  
Exact current yuga detail in my interpretation below.  
  
Confusion Part (and my interpretations):  
-----------------------------------------------------------------  
  
**1) Length of a chaturyuga in human years.**  
This I have inferred to be 24000 human years. The interpretation of some was 24000 celestial years which would mean 24,000 x 360=8,640,000 years. But this has recently been pointed out to be a wrong interpretation attributed to the effect of kaliyuga on the mind.  
Thus going by this, the final age of universe would be about 100 x 360 x 1000 x 2 x 24000 = 1,728,000,000,000 years or 1 trillion and 728 billion years. Of course, it is reasonable to agree that The Lord Brahma would have taken the equivalent of some human years before he actually began with his retinue and will end it not at the 12th hour.  
  
**2) Exact day of the 51st year of the Lord Brahma.**  
This I have interpreted to be 54th day.  
  
**3) Exact time in the current chaturyuga.**  
Again, as has been recently pointed, we are in the ascending dwapara of the 28th chaturyuga. And the Kaliyuga ended in the year 1699.  
These can be googled.  
  
Thus going by these, my personal interpretation of the 'current' age of the Universe is:  
a) For 50 years:  
50×360×1,000×2×24,000 = 864,000,000,000 years.  
  
b) For 53 past days:
53 x 2  x 1000 x 24000 =  2,544,000,000 years
  
c) For the current day:  
We are in the 7th manvantara (each has 71 chaturyugas + .5 in between manvantaras) and 28th of its chaturyuga, so  
6 x 71 + 3 + 27 = 456 chaturyugas gone, so:  
456 x 24000 =10,944,000 years
  
d) For the current chaturyuga:  
Since last kaliyuga ended in 1699, so since then we have had 2014 - 1699 = 315 years. Adding 12000 years for the descent, we have,  
12000 + 315 = 12315 till 31st december 2014.  
  
So, the final tally for the current age of the universe would be (adding the above a, b, c d calculations):  
 864,000,000,000 + 2,544,000,000 + 10,944,000 + 12315 = 866,554,956,315 years.  
  
**That is, the Current Age of the Universe is 866 billion, 554 million, 956 thousand and 315 years as of 31st december 2014.**
  
For the Final Age of the Universe we have:  
100 × 360 × 1000 × 2 × 24000 = 1,728,000,000,000 years.  
This is how long the material universe tends to last.  
  
Now, you are welcome to share your interpretations.   
  
Ok, I will add this reddit thing :  
**TLDR : My interpretation of the Current Age of the Universe is 866 billion, 554 million, 956 thousand and 315 years as of 31st december 2014**  
  
And this Hindu thing:  
**By the grace of the Lords and the blessings of Mothers, I release this knowledge to the world.**  
  
Edit : This blind downvoting is the sign of intolerance. Those who think they have understood too much of science, I would like to point it to them that the civilization of the west is a civilization of light. Go spread some light if you identify so much with it. Why do you get so insecure when other viewpoints are put up? Even interpretations? If you want to have your own space, dont call it india.

Seriously though,I do have to ask - has someone actually decided to report Reddit to the local police? Explanations are in order about what exactly happened to prompt this post, neoronin. 
 My fellow (/r/)Indians, I think it's time to re-read [this](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). 

PLEASE, click report only when you see spam. I'm out of the loop here. What's happening? To be precise, r/india needs to decide whether it will encourage trolling or not. Few passionate Redditors are keeping this sub-reddit alive and the last thing we need is to lose them because of incessant trolling. Can you give us some examples? 1. An already controversial and passion-stirring topic taken to the Internet can do nothing but raise even more passion and controversy.

2. Controversial topics not only attract people who are passionate about it, but also a crowd of angry and/or frustrated people barely picking up the opportunity to express their anger or to shout out loud their pain.

3. Comments, upvotes and downvotes are anonymous. ""*Give a mediocre person some power, and you will get a tyrant*"". [deleted] why are you conflating downvoting and reporting? your current problem, i believe, is with the latter. people are going to downvote stuff that offends them whatever you say. okay, after reading just one thread, i have to say that nothing in my four years of reading reddit has been as great an irritant as the stupid box that pops up every time my mouse pointer happens to intersect a down arrow. please get rid of it!

edit: nevermind, i hadn't noticed the ""use subreddit style"" checkbox Fact: Indians thrive on drama. good call on the CSS popup, but i'm not sure that'll help. IMHO trolls/or haters will ignore the popup. could you possibly have them enter a ""why i'm downvoting this"" for a few weeks? or something of that order. keep the who of the downvotes anonymous, but make the why's public? not sure if it would work, or how one would implement it.

Constructive criticism/other ideas to rein in hate/trolling welcome. [deleted] Some Questions for neoronin: 

- So, you said its not possible to know who is reporting, is it possible its just one or a few people? 

- What happens if a comment gets reported? 

- is it possible for those who are more experienced redditers to weigh in when they see a something getting strange?

 Only In an Indian subforum, someone has the audacity and the time to sit through and do something like this. If you need any help, let me know.

Announcement: New mod and change in submission rules,15,k54bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k54bk/announcement_new_mod_and_change_in_submission/,54,"Please welcome rahulthewall as our new moderator. He has been an r/india regular for ages now and has contributed immensely to the positive development of our community. With the new mod team in place, r/india should be able to continue its growth in the right direction. 

With this announcement, I would also like to bring to your notice on few changes in the submission rules. 

The direct linking to blog rule is removed. You can do direct blog submissions from now on. But strictly no self promotion. Self promotion is defined in the reddiquette. 

Submitting articles from one blog and not submitting any other links and not participating in discussions are defined as self-promotion. Submitting blog links are fine once in a while [definition of this period is flexible]. But if you are spamming us, you will be banned.

I would like to explain the history beyond the old rule and why we removed it now. Between 2008 - 2009, r/india was spammed with direct submissions from blogs incessantly. This led to a rule of banning submissions from all blogs [blogspot, wordpress, tumblr, etc] 

From the end of 2010, we have seen this trend drop. So we relaxed this rule and allowed linking to blogs in a self-submission. Now this self-promotion has dropped completely. 

**Also, strictly no porn links.**

Most of us browse r/india in our workplaces and we would love to keep the access.

If you have any issues with the change in the blog submission rule, please let us know.",neoronin," Can we have r/gonewildindia then ? The Wall reporting for Duty. I am fine with everything you said, but why the injunction against porn? First of all, I have never actually seen anything pornographic in this subreddit. Secondly, if someone wishes to submit something that's not safe for work, why won't the NSFW tag suffice?  I'm submitting porn.  >Also, strictly no porn links.

The mod's threat was worded as follows:

> Can you stop with personal attacks??

> Please consider this as your first warning.

**It was not a Reddiquette enforced thread.** So, is it a general rule now that no ""personal attacks"" are allowed on /r/India on any thread? I checked the ""Rules"" in the side-bar, and there was nothing there about ""personal attacks"". There is something under the ""Requests"" which is worded thusly:

> Do read the Reddiquette and refrain from personal/vindictive attacks while commenting.

Several questions:

1. What is the difference between ""Rules"" and ""Requests""? I thought Requests are nice-to-have requests which can be ignored.

2. What constitutes a ""personal/vindictive attack""? Specifically, are the use of expletives now considered as considered as ""attacks""? What about calling someone a moron, an idiot, stupid, etc.? Where does the ""vindictive"" part figure in this?

3. Are ""personal attacks"" not allowed anywhere? Not even on non-Reddiquette enforced threads? So, no use of expletives?

4. Is ""no personal attacks"" an enforced rule or a suggested request? If it is the latter, please move it to the rules section. If it is the latter, please don't threaten people for ignoring a request.

5. Also, the request I quoted above suggests that we ""read the Reddiquette"", but nothing about following Reddiquette. Is that the intention?

Please respond?!!?!?!??! lol All he said is op is on periods. It's no personal attack. It's not like op is first and only one to get periods. Half of population gets periods. 

Girls don't get offended even if you say it to their face. They just laugh it off and calm down. Mods need to hang out with more women.  I don't think it should be a ground for a ban, not because banning is the wrong action to take but because if you go ahead and ban people for using expletives it will just devolve into a sub with more banned users than unbanned.

I think Reddit's pre-existing upvote/downvote system is good enough to handle content which does not contribute to the discussion. Seriously-personal attacks should be avoided, but locx's statement 'are you having your periods' was no personal attack IMHO. 

If that was a personal attack we should also have a new rule  to call every one *Ji* or *Shri* or Mr/Ms for those who don't understand Hindi.

Why I am not a Hindu,0,23ov63,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/23ov63/why_i_am_not_a_hindu/,27,"Suddenly since about 1990 the word 'Hindutva' has begun to echo in our ears, day in and day out, as if everyone in India  who is not a Muslim, a Christian or a Sikh is a Hindu. I am being told that I am a Hindu. I am also told that my parents, relatives and the caste in which we were born and brought up are Hindu. This totally baffles me.  I, indeed not only I, but all of us, the dalitbahujans of India have never heard the word - not as a word, nor as a name of a culture nor as a name of a religion - in our childhood days. We heard about Turukoolli (Muslims), we heard about Kiristianiapoollut (Christians), we heard about Bapanoolu (Brahmins) and Konaioolli (Baniyas) spoken of as people who were different from us. Among these four categories, the most different were the Bapanoollu and the Komatoollu. There are at least some aspects of life common to us and the Turukoollu and the Kiristianapoollu. We all eat meat. We all touch each other... The only people with who we had no relations whatsoever were the Bapanoollu and the Komatoollu. But today we are suddenly being told that we have a common religious and cultural relationship with them.

Nothing but ad hominem bullshit in comments.",DopingExpress," [‘Institutes like IITs and IIMs should be closed down’ - Kancha Ilaiah] (http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1023204) Instead of bringing up Dalits and other historically oppressed people to a level playing field, this guy proposes to bring down the rest of India to level the playing field. Silly fellow. I *am* a Hindu. And I find the rise of the ""Hindutva"" phenomenon very disturbing. 

Militant Hinduism goes against every fibre of Hindu philosophy in the Vedas and the Gita. I abhor Shiv Sena and their ways. I don't like the way in the last decade, history books are being modified to say Akbar was a bad king, when for years and years we have heard countless good things. 

These are just a few I can think of off the top of my head and between things at work.  I am a Hindu. I am even cool with Hindutva. But I do not like how Hindutva has absorbed some monotheistic character, like insisting on one version of the Ramayana and deciding other people's sexual preferences for them. Ileyah and other Osmania University people from Hyderabad are systematically trying to break India (particularly hindus). Their hatred is incredible if you read Kanche's readings. Let me summarize mr.Ilaiah and the likes in a few points. This will show his beliefs, actions and how much importance we should give this idiot.

1. With adulterated logic and foreign funding, they publish books and writings which are flawed at best.
2. People like ileyah are so entrenched in revenge over the upper castes that they think every thing that is pious, religious or helpful to any upper caste must be objected to. He conducts beefearting seminars, hate seminars regularly in conjunction with MIM (owasi party) in Hyderabad. The Congress govt. in AP is spineless.
3. He also gives crap about Kashmir issue. In his opinion, protecting India is protecting the properties/resources of upper castes. So, Kashmir is not the issue for him. Little does he understand, that the Taliban and other extremists in Pakistan, give damn about lower castes. For them anyone other than muslims are asshs. 
So, Mr. Ilayah through out his life has done only one thing - Promote hatred for upper castes.
Little does he realize that M.K. Gandhi was the pioneer (almost on par with Ambedkar) in helping the upliftment of the 'untouchables'. He coined the word - ""Hari-jans"". 
4. He adheres to the Indo-Aryan invasion theory and says all upper castes are foreigners, although there are no concrete evidences to prove the theory in itself. Also, there is a clear motive for propagating this theory - breaking hindus. The same lot believes muslims who certainly borrowed their religion 800 years ago, are as Indian as the rest. This level of hypocrisy is stultifying.
5. He supports Mayawati to be the PM of India (one day).
6. Proof of his association with foreign associations aimed at denigrating hindu feeling in Indians is overwhelming and can be found easily.",Reddiquette,2014-04-23 00:39:35

Now, I think this is a horrible and hollow idea. Political posturing at it's worst. What is the logic behind pouring such a large sum of money into a project like this when there are millions of people who are actually alive that the money would serve better? 

A large portion of the population goes hungry and cold every night. Why spend such a vast sum 'honoring' a dead man who probably wouldn't approve of this himself if he were alive to see it? Wouldn't empowering the poor and the destitute of our country be a better use for the money? 

I do not want this harebrained idea to see the light of day and I doubt that I am alone in this. What can we do to make our voices heard? What can we do to ensure that reason prevails in this matter? 

I understand that it will help tourism, but is that really worth the cost of letting the poorest among us go hungry?

Is there a way to mark a new topic such that only up votes are allowed in the discussion and no down votes ?,1,2i6n2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2i6n2e/is_there_a_way_to_mark_a_new_topic_such_that_only/,4,"Firstly, I am not too sure if and how this is allowed within the Reddit framework. Off late, its getting annoying to see interesting points (both on the right and the left) being simply down voted instead of being thoroughly refuted by a counter-view. Too often people end up writing *guys, lets not down vote the above post as it adds to the discussion* or *i see silent down voting happening on my comments, pls refute if you disagree*. 

Can find two specific threads today having that same situation. Maybe we can do this for all threads marked Reddiquette. What say people ?",homelessvagrant," There is no way to disable downvotes on reddit. Some subreddits (like /r/bakchodi, /r/shitredditsays) still do it using CSS wizardry which definitely deters the users from downvoting, but ones who are using any other client other than the browser, or those who have custom styles disabled, or the ones who are hell-bent on shutting someone up, will still be able to downvote.

That said, Reddit rules clearly discourage the mods of individual subreddits to tamper with the voting buttons. Both upvotes and downvotes are necessary to keep the subreddit clear of off-topic and low-efforts posts and comments. 

People misusing downvote buttons to drown unpopular opinions is a different issue altogether, not just limited to /r/india, but is there on almost every subs which has a diverse demographic. The etiquette around voting is mentioned on the [Reddiquette page](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) (link in footer), which I doubt is visited by any user. Reddit should make this message more prominent and display in a more strategically placed location so users are reminded of it more often. We do have a small hover message on /r/india which shows up right when you are about to downvote.

Could Rahul Gandhi have actually had conspired Congress' Decimation to Increase his own Political Profile by introducing Reorganization of the Congress Party?,0,25wr0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25wr0u/could_rahul_gandhi_have_actually_had_conspired/,4,"Could this be possible? Maybe they conspired about this election looking forward to the General Elections to be held 15 years later? [Reddiquette Please ( => Comment if you are downvoting) ]
",Isnotabot," Sorry he just doesn't display the brains to pull that off. Even if this was true, he would have to pull a rabbit out of his behind to get the Indian public to stop seeing him as a joke.. Way too far fetched a theory to warrant any discussion.

Tired of the hate against leftists in r/india? Welcome to IndianLeft,0,1r4nzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1r4nzh/tired_of_the_hate_against_leftists_in_rindia/,6,"This is a subreddit modeled on the likes of r/truereddit.

A subreddit for really great, insightful articles, reddiquette, reading before voting and the hope to generate intelligent discussion on the topics of these articles. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/IndianLeft/

Communists, socialists, anarchists, left libertarians, libertarian socialist, the new left, or anyone who does not associate with the right wing ideology that dominates /r/india are welcome. I'm not looking for a huge community, but one which engages in serious discussions about the various political, economic, feminist issues relating to India.

Anyone who'd want to moderate the subreddit, please comment here.",IndianLeft," Anarchists are leftist ? I didn't know this - I thought they were radical left wing.

Also along these lines were the naxalites anarchists ?

And was Netaji Bose a radical leftist ? More like Blame Hindus for Everything, Islamic apologists. Left libertarian??? Who are these people?? Chutiya leftists. As usual cant take any criticism, blames critics for have a different POV, while at the same time wants their POV to be ~~heard~~ broadcasted on MSM by their leftists editor friends. Buncha loser comrade sissies.",Reddiquette,2013-11-21 17:23:57
MCing a Gujju + Mallu Wedding sangeet - Need content,1,2pc96v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2pc96v/mcing_a_gujju_mallu_wedding_sangeet_need_content/,2,"Hey guys. Two super close friends are getting married - Mallu boy and Guju girl. I'm MCing the sangeet. 

It's not a typical sangeet - the boy's mallu family is putting up a piano performance and one jazz and one soft rock band performance (trust the mallus to be awesome at the music bit). The gujjus are doing a dance and a singing performance.

I'm MCing this non-typical sangeet. And need funny content. Any insights about mallus will be hugely helpful - I'm trying to make a buzzfeed style 'How to survive your gujju/mallu in-laws/families'. Any other ideas will also be helpful.

(P.S. This is my first post here to please excuse any reddiquette violations :))

tl;dr: Need a source for non-offensive family-friendly mallu & gujju jokes

Update: No longer looking for buzzfeed style content - realized it's complete shit",BombayBoy84," Yeah, I think you blew it by saying buzzfeed style.  
No one's gonna want to help you now.  ",Reddiquette,2014-12-15 15:22:13
