Absolutely this should be made in local languages as well. 22 official languages is a must. FSSAI is one department which really tries to do it's job. They've openly refused certification for many big names, and they are pushing for very tough food health limits (sodium and sugar limits) in packaged food now. They also seem to be completely immune of who's the ruling government. It's quite admirable.  Nice, though I was disappointed how often the test for adulteration was:

**India top-ranked country in mobile data consumption: Amitabh Kant** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Lending a testimony to Indians' romance with mobile internet
consumption,

Niti Aayog

CEO (chief executive officer)

Amitabh Kant

, on Wednesday, tweeted that India has become ""world's no 1

mobile data

consuming country."" The tweet further said that,""It's(India) mobile data
consumption is higher than USA &amp; China's mobile data consumption put
together.""

> Amazing! With 150 cr gigabytes per month of mobile data consumption India is
now world's no 1 mobile data consuming... https://t.co/PnE4ihLdxo

>

> — Amitabh Kant (@amitabhk87) 1513908042000

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

Mukesh Ambani

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and
that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day.""

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

 LOL news of the day. I considered python to be most useful language for scientific research. in b4 'we invant' True. Just like Urdu is important for space travel. 
/s Phir shuru ho gaye bhencho. Yeh saaley thaktey nahin hein is sab chutiyappe se? Bas karo maaiyavon... Rajnath Singh, and other such idiots in the BJP, should just shut the fuck up. Winning elections doesn't give them a right to spew their ignorance on all and sundry matters. Lol. Chutya saala I doubt if he can even speak 1 word of Sanskrit  I wish I could conduct sanskrit exam all these fellas ! The single most important trait for science and technology is free flow of information. ""I see further because I stand on the shoulder of giants"".

Sanskrit will hugely disrupt this (there are hundreds of thousands of journals and preprint servers); the world is not beating down our doors to learn sanskrit to publish their theses.

Moving S&T to Sanskrit would therefore be a massively retrograde step for India.   Someone should ask this idiot: since Sanskrit is so useful to Science, Mr Singh, can you develop the necessary science to provide some scientific validation of this claim? [deleted] OMG, what a chutiya ?  I charge my mobile using ""Sanskrit'. Wish he had usefully made his speech in Sanskrit; with all reporting in Sanskrit. Then we could ignore him more. [deleted] Scientific Method most useful for science, technology, actual scientists say. 

Yes, I know he was a physics lecturer. That makes this statement all the more unfortunate. 

Sanskrit / Panani's grammar were pioneering and inspired the likes of Chomsky to advance linguistics (later used for designing programming languages) - but it's not the most important component of science.   Sanskrit is a great language, but instead of making pointless statements like this, or attending meetings advocating cow protection, Rajnath could actually try and focus on his job. As someone who initially had great hopes on this government, I am confused as to where the priorities of this government currently lie. Says the guy who has credibility on this subject ..which is an Urban Legend/hoax. This guy is the Minister for Home Affairs.. Mutherfucker write a compiler in Sanskrit. I dare you. I double dare you. How the fuck did he get a Masters in Physics without understanding what science is? wut. As long as you can get your ideas across unambiguously, what does it matter what language you use? ITT, redditors who probably cannot even speak their mother tongue properly, decide to shit on ancient language - because they cannot use that language to lay bitches. 

 Advocating the promotion of Sanskrit, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said even foreign scholars have considered it to be one of the most scientific of languages.

Respect! Sanskrit is an exceptional language as it is an artificially created language (Sam + Krita which means Completely Done or Completely Made)....While Sanskrit is undoubtedly better than most of the existing languages in many linguistic aspects it might not be that suitable for S & T, a single word in Sanskrit can have multiple meanings depending on the context of the sentence, thus making it ambiguous & unsuitable for S & T... This ambiguous nature is also one of the reasons why many S&T things remained hidden in disguise of shlokas & mantras. No it isnt'!!!

What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,6,918ek7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/918ek7/what_are_the_options_for_parttime_undergraduate/,3,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** ",kasam_se," why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ?. Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job? I feel the best option here is:

- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.
- The mother should move in with her son here.
- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.
- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. 
- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.

The mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. 

If you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates. Find out their political preference, and involve the local leader (preferably elected official) of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them. You need to find who has the most influence on the family and try to understand their concern and offer uitable solutions to convince them. 

And thank you for having such concerns for your student - our country is the better for it due to people like you. ",Science/Technology,2018-07-24 00:14:13

Modi government has invited anyone with experience in  in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass-media or administration and governance. 

This is the first time appointment of CIC is not based on seniority and based on merits.


DOPT  Circular - http://ccis.nic.in/WriteReadData/CircularPortal/D2/D02rti/4_7_2014_CIC-IR.pdf This is a good start. The current government has moved away from a seniority based appointment (earlier the senior most Information Commissioner was appointed the Chief) to an based appointment on application merit. Both processes have their own pros and cons.

However, there also seems be a road block. The [appointment process for a CIC](http://cic.gov.in/information_commissions.htm#19.) is done by a committee that includes the Prime Minister, one Union Cabinet Minister nominated by PM and the Leader of Opposition. We do not have a LoP as yet and any attempt to appoint one without the LoP may be viewed as a subversion of the process and therefore, unconstitutional. OR may be politically, we will soon see a LoP appointed. [**@OnlineRTI**](https://twitter.com/OnlineRTI):

I'll post the results of this survey here on /r/India in a few days.

Disclosure: I am with an NGO committed to improving the quality of STEM exposure in India.  We will use your responses to guide our future activities.  You can learn more about us through our first activity --- a science fair in Bangalore --- here [http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/](http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/)",happy_elephant," From what I hear in India, there is literally zero exposure to scientific thinking; the more options are made to rote learning and puking back content in exams, than understanding. 

Problem? funding. Most of the schools / colleges have to keep cost low and apparatus as old as 1947 are there. 

Alternative: Make math and science fun. No, computers/ laptops/phones do not count in learning - they serve as more of games or entertainment than the real thing.  Not a parent, but we need more exposure to critical and rational thinking. The amount of people that immediately believe bogus chain mails and forwards is staggering. Just think people. Frankly, I don't see too many Indian parents particularly interested in their kid's education until they reach college.  Particularly parents who are in business and wealthy.

school jata hain.  fail nahin hota hai.  haan theek hain.  baad main kyaa hogaa dekhaa jayegaa.  abhi aur kaam hain.  business hi to karega.  padhne main zyada kuch nahin hain. I wish Indian media paid more attention to quality of education in India.  To begin with, shouldn't we have rankings of high schools and colleges in India.  India Today does some work on this, but given our population and the number of schools and colleges don't we need better quality, and comprehensive rankings. >here http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/

I support you..very nice initiative.

but..isko escape velocity nahi bolna tha..you know there's special joke of this on r/India. Don't Indian kids already have an overdose of science and academics?  You should be working to expose them to more sports and arts and literature. Your website is really ordinary.  

How much does it cost to get a really high quality website made?  50k?

What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA?,4,cj7xx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cj7xx0/what_is_the_future_of_artificial_intelligence_and/,1," 

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Let me give you an example. I worked at motorcycle manufacturer in an Assistant Manager role in R&D. My job was to measure the dimensions of electrical components for new motorcycle models. And for that, I was paid more than 6 lakhs per year. 

One simple computer vision app can replace this entire job function (when I was working there, there were around 10 others who were doing the same thing, with different components)",Science/Technology,2019-07-29 15:28:48
A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,9,bwmz0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwmz0o/a_criticism_of_the_new_education_policy_2019_and/,6,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

To Redditors of Kolkata,1,bpgagr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/,0,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",arkoprovo1996,,Science/Technology,2019-05-17 02:38:12
"India is not a country, it is a union of countries",21,6w8oqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6w8oqs/india_is_not_a_country_it_is_a_union_of_countries/,44,"Ever since I can remember, I have wanted to improve the state of affairs of this country fundamentally. As a millennial, when I was young I was inspired by our independence and the patriotism that followed it. But as I grew and explored what the nation of India intrinsically meant and what it’s true genealogy was, it started spiraling down to be an empty concept. 

Nations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they’re claiming as their nation. This formation of a country, in cases other than autocracy, could be incited through a common ancestry, language, religion or ideology. The Indian independence incited us to form this nation, the constitution sealed it. But what is it really that binds us? Religion? No, we’re supposedly a secular nation. Language? Of course not. Ancestry? Not so much. Ancestrally, Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans than they’re to Biharis. Ideology? Nope. 

So why are we still a single country? Because, TAX. The centre can tax the whole country which is a HUMUNGOUS sum of money considering our ever-growing population. The governments have generation after generation fooled us using ‘nationalism’ while they eat our hard-earned tax. It is our money, it is our time and energy. I have agreed through the constitution to pay taxes along with my fellow people for a service, a service called the government. The only responsibility of this service is to improve the life of it’s people. But what it has become is a handful of pigs gobbling up the tax collected from a BILLION people. With this enormous sum of money comes enormous  power, the power to buy anything and everything. The power to buy the media. The power to cause so much toxic language pollution (fake news) that none of us realize what the real problems are. The power to stagnate education and hence reason. The pigs took away education from us, the worst thing that could be done as a government, it’s worse than physically crippling one. 

When we are given statistics like India's GDP is the sixth highest, it hides a lot of important information. Per capita is what matters. We're not supposed compare an economy of 1.3 Billion to 82 million of Germany or 127 million of Japan. There is absolutely nothing to be proud of. It's fallacious, it's a pseudo-statistic. The population of Bihar and UP combined is a 300 million. Yet we're constantly fooled by similar statistics that adds to our epidemic complacency that we're a growing nation. Science, technology, economy, healthcare, sports everywhere the statistics can fool us if we see us as just one country. 

Democracy is naive. A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy. When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day’s wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power. 

I’m no anti-national. National and anti-national don’t even mean anything if one digs deeper. They’re simply terms used by people for selfish reasons to stamp a person and reduce the details of what he/she says to merely ‘national’ or ‘anti-national’. We should simply stop using these terms and use a more productive terminology to label and discuss ideas. Everything is in the details, this is not about clickbait and headlines, these are supremely complex and deep problems that cannot be discussed and solved if we use crass terminology. The pigs are chauvinists and language polluters, they don’t care, they don’t even know, they will say anything to get media’s attention and media’s attention is more votes. What we need is a radical ideological revolution to give meaning to this beautiful ‘nation’. We should evolve to form a confederacy of countries based on a modern yet moral ideology.

A family is not a family....its a union of individuals.

Whats the point ?? Pigs everywhere !!!! You sound pretty salty here. Let's clarify some things:

1. There are nations that form for different reasons. India formed because of the of a) The British (at least in terms of their empire) and b) The Indian Freedom Fighters (who tried to keep the country consolidated after independence. Kudos particularly to Vallabhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru. http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/S8YxVMKFfwaIeLHUWCYINI/Vallabhbhai-Patel-and-the-making-of-India.html)

1. Second, their rationale behind them was not to ""Collect Taxes"". Contrary to what you're saying, the fathers of our nation believed that we were better and stronger together. Patel, Nehru, Gandhi, Ambedkar, Naidu, et. al. believed keeping the Indian state intact was the natural thing to do. They had a relatively cosmopolitan education/upbringing and believed people of all states needed to band together. Their regional affiliations didn't necessarily bleed onto their mission.

1. While I agree there's a lot of graft and corruption in the Indian Bureaucracy and Political System, India has done well since independence, particularly in the last two decades. How can I say this? Well, GDP per capita has risen from $1100 in 1990 to $6570 in 2016. Here's the source: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?locations=IN

1. You mention India has a Billion people (1.324 Billion) and then complain about education for everyone. You do realize that's a LOT of people right. It'll take decades for primary education to reach them all. Some states are doing it better than others (Kerala for example). It just requires political will.

1. You talk about our GDP numbers like they're a smokescreen. It's not. India is one of the largest economies in the world and while our GDP per capita isn't equal to that of western nations and other Asian countries, it also means we have tremendous potential for growth. Something other countries are struggling with. I hate people comparing us with the US and other European countries. We're literally one of the youngest countries in the world! How well do you think the US was doing in 1860?

1. Democracy is supposed to mean every person has a single vote. It has its flaws, but it is the fairest form of governance. At the end of the day, an imperfect system is better than an oppressive one. And give Indians the credit they deserve. Modi was voted in to bring economic reform. People voted for him because they wanted better lives for their kids. Vote bank politics is dying, slowly but surely. 


Finally, I'd like to say, I know your intentions are very noble here. But it's easy to sit back and complain and bitch about the country. It's harder to roll up your sleeves and work for the nation. I'm not saying you don't do that, but r/india is a great resource to discuss this. There are many educated and diverse opinions here. Eventually, the unkills will leave the country behind for us. Let's not become like them and die saying Sare Jahan se accha Hindustan hamara and then having their kids move abroad.  Add a TLDR please..and I don't know what you are trying to get at.. and how you arrived on answer of union of states, from tax. 

Eating tax of a billion people.?? Which tax are we talking about? The number income tax payers is < 3 %

 >Nations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they’re claiming as their nation.

This nationalism is a very modern concept. We been cosmopolitan from early ages itself. And cherished the subcontinent or peninsula more like a single entity of similar culture. 

For example Sankaracharya from extreme south established four temples at the four corners of modern India at an ancient time where nationalism wasn't upfront. Ujjain has remained the astronomical center for many of Indian calenders, irrespective of kingdoms. 

There is a reason for our extreme population, the land has been sought out by people from all over for fertile pastures and wealth, and those who came here settled. And diversity was inherent of land that shaped its culture, unlike other countries where ethnic groups clustered together. While in America every differences get melted into single stream, here people welcomed the diversity, and it still says that way. 

Also if European population hasn't moved out to their colonies, they would have been faced with this population problem as ours, am sure. > Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans

Nope. Sinhala people are Indo Aryan. They are more closer to Bengalis and Biharis than Tamilians. Your argument is trying to make India out to be a special snowflake.

Just look up the history of the **US of A** or **Germany.**

India's circumstances are not unique or new. These guys will give you the same old bullshit man that's the problem. Fuckers will still tell you about mother india being rich and wealthy centuries ago. We gave the world zero blah blah fucking blah. India is tragic as fuck, the talent and the potential is out of this world but the majority of the people are absolute fucking filth when it comes to mentality. Materialistic, show off, jealous, blinded by religion. Anything for the rupee, will literally sell their own mothers for money. They consider the ability to have maids and slaves as a fucking wow factor of living in India in 2017........all the butthurts are going to down vote this to death. 2 or 3 percent of people won't be like this. Biggest tragedy was the goras leaving. But OP is right though.....no unity at all. Which is one reason I love watching the Indian cricket team at least I feel like there is some unity, that and probably the defense forces. General public bheinchod tamasha dekhne ke liye paida hui hai. Bollywood, Ekta Kapoor, Politics, Babas.....so much chutiyappa. What you basically want is a federal structure, and you'd be surprised to know that the concepts of federalism is already there in the constitution. There are topics which are the state govt's prerogative and the central govt. can't interfere, and there are topics where the opposite is true. It's the reason why we have state governments at all in addition to having central governments. Federalism is something our founding fathers believed in, all it needs is to be strengthened and properly observed. I don't think your idea of completely splitting the country apart into smaller nations is viable. If nothing else, surely you believe that having a single unified military and financial structure is more beneficial than having dozens of them?

>A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy.

The point of democracy is that every citizen has an equal vote share by the virtue of being a citizen, not by the virtue of how productive they are or how educated. If you spend a few minutes pondering on what you wrote, you'd realize how unfair your proposed system would be and how quickly it'll lead to tyranny, by a group if not by an individual.

>When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day’s wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power.

Which is still better than not caring about votes at all and just shoving a gun at people's faces and telling them to do this and that. Again, while nobody says democracy is perfect, you'd realize it's still better than all the alternatives. Enlightened dictatorships only happen in fictions. This feels like a bad idea. Our ""confideracy"" of states will get chewed out by China. Besides.. being part of the same country is beneficial. Look at the water disputed between Karnataka and TN. Things would be a lot worse.

Need help with depression and anger.,9,7yz12m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/,3,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.
....

Will add if you guys advice something worth it.",officialshebu," Go through these things maybe it can help you. 

1. Get off social media, right now. Social media has been linked the number 1 place where one can get depressed easily, by looking at where your friends are and their success and looking at where you are. Want a hang of social media, Do redditing. Here people don't know you. Go to the subreddits that interests you. Talk your heart out.   

2. Get a hobby. Something interesting like writing, trading in market, photography, which ever takes your interest try it.   

3. Stop caring about society and don't give a shit about it. Society will be first one to trash you when you do something wrong. Stop caring about what people feel abot you. Their thinking is dynamic and will change according to circumstances.   

4. Discover a new outlook towards life. 

5. You have to survive no matter what life gives you.   


**Think of yourselves as company whose shares prices have tanked down to their all time low. Take decisions that will take the company high. Don't lose hope.**

**You Go out there and Kill it**

All the Best :)  Man! This brings back memories.

In the immediate aftermath, I felt like being the worst human being. I mean, if being nice still gets you hurt, what's the point of being nice? But for some unknown reason, I didn't go down the dark path of self-sabotage.


The first month was hard. I felt numb. I tried the Body scan technique of mindfulness (Lecture 8, TTC Mindfulness...courtesy tpb :-)

It was nice.


But my recovery started with Brexit and a feeling of schadenfreude. In hindsight, I feel it was a negative straw to latch on to. But it rejuvenated my curiosity to learn about the world i am in.


After a while, I found my appreciation for simple joys of life like pani puri, walking, ice-cream. I am not saying your grief is not real. Heck, the condition I was in, any advice would have made my self-loathing worse.

Now I did some digging and found out there seems to be pattern amongst all of the recent appointments.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

EDIT: WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated. C'mon yaar, it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info, I would request you not to downvote it. Please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate.
",Responsbile_Indian," Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year? I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. 

ISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.

To develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.

There are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.

 [deleted] > Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?  

Because they have failed at their primary goals? Negligible research output, unimpressive pedagogy and a vision that is missing in action. A bit of a shakeup at the top wont hurt. 

FTII on the other hand deserved better than Sri Gajendra. 
 >WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated

Party before Country . Right-wingers definition of nationalism . kids have come to power after 60 years :) . Don't worry next elections they are gonna loose for sure and every state elections from now on  FTII, and Indian film making in general, is as shitty as it can get.

People say Gajendra Chouhan is not qualified to be FTII chief. I say FTII is so shitty, even a random 40 year old with some life experience can only improve it. The one condition is that he/she should not come from FTII, or Indian mainstream film-making, which is just pure horseshit. 
  how is FTII and institution of national importance?

Second question, why should government be in the business of running FTII. >But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance?

You have **one** data point for this.  OP, just one correction. BJP is not far right in the generally accepted spectrum. If anything they would be considered left of centre. Economically, not much separates the BJP and tbh most other parties. Between the Congress and BJP? It is just that the BJP has better execution of projects and lesser vote bank politics. Youth congress making a mountain out of a molehill. Just riling up students for no rhyme or reason. Did UPA not make appointments for these posts? Did EVERY government not make appointments?

"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",46,4gbzmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,18,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

",hganjoo," So it's basically a fridge. >and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

Anecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught. The rest were just in in to clear the exams.

IMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country's education is the contents of the text books it's home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those ""guides"" are so bad it's not even funny. 

This problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don't understand what they're teaching. I got into several arguments about my scores being docked because i'd solved something by actually thinking instead of using what was in the ""book"".  Very well written!

IMO, the good faculties are on the look out for good PhD students and good PhD students are on the look out for good faculties. Currently, it is hard to find either in India. As OP mentions,

> The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation.

From the Computer Science and Engineering perspective, there are two sides to this. In general, a student who has the capacity to do a good PhD is likely capable of working in a good corporate company. Say a good student gets a job which pays ~7lpa. If he/she stays in the industry for 5 years, this would definitely (atleast) double. One can lead a good decently luxurious life with this sort of income. Now come to the Indian PhD student. He/she earns 3.36lpa + travel + book grants, for 5 years (it is not common to have raises for a PhD student). What follows is obvious.

Now one could argue that a student who is actually interested in research should not bother about money. But hell, the student also has a life outside research and needs to have some savings for the future! It is not easy to find jobs in India which require PhDs and do justice to them.

Now without good students, it becomes difficult for good faculties to 'want' to stay in the country. This can, again, be fixed by increasing compensation and freedom for the faculties. 

We need to take lessons from Israel. A country as big as Mizoram, has 9 universities, around 6 of them being in the top 100 universities of the world. Even though I do not trust world rankings too much, it is sufficient enough to believe that their 6th will be as good as our best. How did they manage this? I am not sure, but I do not think nationalism has played too much of a role. It is probably due setting up the best infrastructure, inviting the best researchers, giving them sufficient compensation and a lot of academic freedom.

**tl; dr** Invite the best researchers, give them sufficient compensation, academic freedom. Students and quality of research will follow. Can we also use the argument in OP's post to explain how so little engineering is actually done in india and how many of the ""engineering"" firms are just glorified contractors? http://408perceptions.blogspot.com/2016/08/engineering-in-inida-is-waste-of-time.html whatch this article

We could also get married and I could apply for an X-visa, and whilst marriage is on the cards, and eventually I will apply for an OCI card, the X-visa doesn't let you work, and so short-term isn't much use above letting me stay there whilst I look for work.

An Exposition and Solution to the NGO problem,1,28fy7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28fy7b/an_exposition_and_solution_to_the_ngo_problem/,1,"**Disclaimer**: I am not the author. This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",nerds_revenge," Remaining essay: 


This can ONLY happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the GOI
(1) are initiated, mandated and funded by the deep-state itself;
(2) inculcate through their activities a sense of mission, dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood;
(3) are TRULY not-for-profit, and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitely.

This last is a crucial distinction; NGOs which define themselves as ""non-profit"" have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to ""help"", because their OWN survival, and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train, depends on it.",Science/Technology,2014-06-18 15:37:31

This would be a journal of BJP stupidity in printed forget, See, people who are dumb, lazy, without an iota of critical thinking, comepletely superstitious, are very easy to subdue and control. You can guess what their endgame is. What's the end game?

Is this just another jumla to win more elections?

Don't they want to actually run the country for about 20-30 years?

Are they all one day going to get up and scoot to Antigua, Nigeria and UK?

Ambani cannot run away like Choksi or Modi did.

Nor can the Sangh.

Can't they see that the first chance that China sees of a broken country, they will try to control the country?

What's the 20 year game plan of Shah?

Winning elections is cool and I respect their awesome skills at manipulating everybody and everything without hacking EVMs, but in the end, where is this headed?

A feudal India is just waiting to be colonised or defeated economically to the point of virtual colonisation like China is doing with African and some Central and West Asian nations. USA is on the decline. China isn't going to stop till it becomes _the_ biggest superpower.

Modi can't see how he is dismantling the country because he is a psycopath who has achieved his life goal and is rudderless. He already has become King Emperor. There's nothing left to do.

But what's with the Sangh and Shah?

The Sangh plans well, like an expert Sith Lord waiting for decades.

I don't see an endgame here that benefits them - unless they really truly believe in a 1800s or 1700s culture as being the best for India. Then we are truly in the grip of a mad cult.

But I doubt that. Ambani, of all people, has serious vision. Will he step in and become PM? If not openly, by proxy?

Doesn't he have a vision for a billion and half potential slaves?

He has to understand economics really well, right?

Disposable incomes and all that.

What's the Sangh's endgame?

With Congress / UPA you could see that the endgame is simple - stay in power, do 20% good, 30% bad and 50% negligence - and just always stay in power. That 20% good was RTI and stable economy and all that.

With this Govt, there is literally no real 20% good.

There's only madness of one kind or another - cow, Mandir, vedic supremacy, ""China is bad"" while everything patriotic is owned by or made in China, Swachch Bharat is a joke, DeMo was a scam, GST is a disaster, Aadhar is a conspiracy.

Kuch to long term socha bhi hai ki nahi?

I can forgive Modi being a fool. He is a megalomaniac. But I cannot digest that all of them are fools and nobody is asking them to look at the bigger picture or the longer term.

They're behaving like day traders when they own the stock exchange. 

Who does that level of stupidity?

DAFUQ!? Some other propoganda from this site:


Fresh cow dung kills bacteria that cause malaria and TB. Cow dung is used for protection from atomic emission. Cow urine contains copper which transfers into gold in human body. Gold has power to destroy all pathogens. Cow urine also contains iron, calcium, phosphorus, carbonic acid, potash and lactase. It contains 24 types of salt and several useful medicines are made from cow urine.

We're fucked right to the core of the country arent we?

His desi gai stayed though What's the criteria for being declared honest? Shouldn't it be said as racist... Poor buffalo's being discrimated ...  As I veterinary student, it is my experience that the opposite is true in almost all the points. Exotic breeds have a friendlier temperament than indigenous ones, while also having higher production and better feed conversion efficiency. Local breeds are much more aggressive and a nightmare to treat.
And Buffalo milk is much better suited for making products like ice cream, butter, etc due to more fat percentage while buffaloes themselves are more disease resistant in general, and cleaner as they have almost no hair and love bathing in water.
Also, there is no 'surya ketu' nerve. Well none that I've ever read about in any anatomy textbook. M.Tech. Gau Rakshak Last 3 points for buffaloes are sketches of Bollywood villains. Lol at the milk point being mentioned after a statistic on the intestine. UNSECO has declared Indian cow (Gaumata) as the best in the world.

author is confused, maybe?

Abdul Kalam is known as a scientist coz he was one by his profession and designation, in both drdo and isro. One needn't be an academician and guide PhDs like Rao for being worthy of the title. It's the equivalent of saying that professional scientists of NASA or NCAR aren't real scientists as they are not Professors. Unlike the latter whose career depends upon impact factors and finding, career scientists have more security and a more focused domain. Creating a new satellite or any stuff doesn't mean that they are copy pasting or just scaling a design like lego builders; it involves applied science, hundreds or thousands developing new materials, better fuel options, better heat dissipation, structural design, aerodynamics, control systems and all sorta works. And unlike academicians of basic research they don't have the compulsion to publish for brownie points. Sometimes you are not exactly allowed to publish, even.

To the arguement of India lagging behind science, by research output we are at top 5; and research funding we at top 6.

But, this article feels more like Sheldon Cooper making Physicist master race arguement, that surprisingly ends in a compulsive suggestion on the very applied science it has been bashing . India ? Sure a country with more than 1 billion human beings don't know the difference between tech and science because some idiotic article said so.   **India still doesn’t know the difference between tech & science** and that's why A P J Abdul Kalam is considered by all and sundry to be a scientist.

Which branch you’re in? You can still move to pure sciences, lot of people have done it.

Stats or applied maths will get you a great career in data science. Financial mathematics can get you a career in HFT firms or others as Quantitative Analyst but it’s tough to get into, you have to be really good at your maths.

If you are in other branches also, these fields are open. Applied physics is also good for niche careers especially if you have mech background.

NEW DELHI: A central panel, set up in April to study the role of cow urine and dung in curing diseases and scientific validation of uniqueness of indigenous cows, is likely to have its first meeting next month when it will assign various projects to ministries and institutions.The panel, headed by science and technology minister Harsh Vardhan , will evaluate the role of 'Panchagavya' — a concoction of cow urine mixed with cow dung, milk, curd and ghee — in four broad areas like medicine, products for agriculture applications, food and nutrition and utility products.Besides eminent scientists like former CSIR director general R A Mashelkar, the panel has members from RSS and VHP-linked organisations. The tenure of this panel will be for three years. ""Though the panel — National Steering Committee NSC ) — was constituted long ago, it could not meet so far due to one or the other important engagements of its members,"" said V K Vijay of the Centre for Rural Development and Technology (CRDT), IITDelhi. He is one of the members of the 19-member panel.Amid indication of its first meeting some time next month, Vijay told TOIon Sunday that the panel will function as an apex body for guiding a national programme on 'Scientific Validation and Research on Panchgavya'.TOI had in February reported the government's plan to form such a committee. The panel includes chancellor of Nalanda University in Bihar Vijay P Bhatkar, IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao and secretaries of the departments of science & technology, biotechnology and renewable energy. Other members include Sunil Mansinghka of VHPlinked Go Vigyan Anusandhan Kendra which has long been involved in research on cow urine and cow dung.

 My dad worked there for plenty of years. Says the Institute is corrupt as fuck with very little original research actually comes out. Quite a lot of scientists indulge in petty corruption and a ,ajor requirement is to be a brown noser and not a good scientist if you want to advance your career.

CSIR claims to have licensed a percentage of its patents, but has so far failed to show any revenue earned from the licences.

ISRO does it and look where it is now; developed its own cryogenic technology . You don't see them begging for funds because they have successfully managed their organisation. And the government doesn't interfere. 

I will be glad if government stop pouring taxpayers money into those other money sucking black holes like Air India, BSNL etc.

Tuition around $120k total for two years. Living expenses depends on the city. But budget around $80k-$100k for living expenses for two years. Likelihood of scholarship in top 20 schools is very low based on your profile. If you go below top 20 schools, you may get a scholarship based on GMAT, but you may not get a job.

>6) He is a merchandiser and has been in this industry for 3 years. He has worked for one start up also(pretty crucial role), can leaving his current job for 2-3 months for preparation have negative impact? (in terms of Recommendation letter, Work experience etc.)

Depends on the rapport with the person who will give recommendation letter. Small gaps won't likely have huge impact on application. But three years of overall experience is very low for US b-schools where the median is 5 years and for Indian applicants, it's likely around 7-8 years.

India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology,17,7tahs2,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-must-shed-intellectual-colonialism-to-excel-in-science-and-technology/story-wfbhX71Evf9ilqqUKkjAQL.html,6,,s18m," Language is least of the issues with science and technology in India. The entire education system is based on the Sharma ji ka beta ko 90% mila tereko 89.9999 kyun mila ? system. The rat race is for marks and not for imparting basic education irrespective of the language.  LOL, fuckers really like tampering with education. How about saying to no to learning *vaimanika shastra* and *gomutra yagnas* etc?

Science isn't intellectual colonialism.By teaching it in Enlish, you are just ensuring that children are able to hook up on research at a global scale directly rather than be mediated by translators. 

Also, fuck your hindi-speaker employment schemes.

**India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology** 

 ______ 
There is a major power imbalance in the world, which comes from the language
that dominates the world of discovery, innovation, and science and technology.
Today, that language is English. The intellectual domination of the West comes
from the building of communities whose power comes from their deep connection
with their native language. The language which they use to think, dream and
shape the world is their own. This results in ideas that can change the world.
If you do not use or have a mastery over your native language in science and
technology, then, mere facility makes you a great follower and never a leader.

While overthrowing political and economic colonialism, we have failed to
overthrow intellectual colonialism. In making English the sole language of
intellectual discourse in science and technology in India, we have lost on
many fronts. First, exceptions aide, as a community even our best institutions
can never lead globally if English is the only language of high-level
intellectual discourse. Our best minds will merely be eloquent paraphrasers of
the ideas of others. Second, we close opportunities in intellectual leadership
to huge sections of our population. In other words, as intellectuals we cannot
be the best in the world. In addition to this, we lock the doors to even the
second- level positions we occupy as elites. One of the many consequences of
this is a poor connection of professional leadership with our society. Thus,
we fail in being great intellectuals, we exclude and do not share a sense of
purpose for society. In turn, our society responds to this elitism by
undervaluing learning and the intellectual enterprise.

There have been many examples of countries which have successfully addressed
the twin-challenges of developing communities of intellectual leaders in
science and technology and are yet deeply rooted in using their native
language for churning ideas. In Germany, science students would have had their
principal language as German and yet be fluent in English. Many of the best
German labs are international and the language of discourse may well be in
English, yet, the advantage that comes from the ability that German scientists
have to think in their native language, in the most advanced scientific
subjects, is not small. Conversely, no country, including India, that has
chosen English as its primary language of scientific discourse, ignoring its
local languages, has become an intellectual powerhouse.

Whenever there is a discussion on this subject, two arguments are made against
university education in one’s native language. The first is that English is
necessary in today’s world, which is valid. The answer is not to diminish
English, but to enhance the use of one’s native language at every level. The
second argument is that the task is impossible to implement. This argument is
both a cop-out and false. It is a cop-out because not taking this up forever
makes us an intellectual vassal-state, while maintaining an elite that is both
dysfunctional and disinterested. The argument is false because the task is
entirely feasible with focus and investment.

What, then, is to be done? Currently, the bulk of our college education in
science and technology is notionally in English whereas the bulk of our high-
school education is in the local language. Science courses in college are thus
accessible largely to the urban population and even when this happens,
education is effectively, neither of quality in English nor communicated as
translations of quality in the classroom. Starting with the Kendriya
Vidyalayas and the Nayodya Vidyalayas as test-arenas, we can ensure the
training of teachers so that students in high-school are simultaneously taught
in both their native language and in English. This already happens informally,
but its needs formalisation. The student should be free to take exams in
either language or indeed use a free-flowing mix. This approach should be
steadily ramped up and used in all our best educational institutions in
college and then scaled to be used more widely. Public and private colleges,
in STEM subjects, for example, can lead and make bi-lingual professional
education, attractive and economically viable. Technology, can of course
assist implementation, but the primary driver is a will to change.

Our international partners envy the facility many Indians have with English.
Without losing this, we must also have the ability to think deeply about
complex and difficult subjects at the level of the best in the world. This can
come only when communities in Rajasthan, Kerala or Odisha can wield, in their
minds, their respective languages in the frontier areas of science the way in
which the French, the Dutch or the Germans do. We should not conflate the use
of English as the vehicle for communication and commerce with the use of
language as the basis for the power of ideas.

"Scientists of India, ministry of science and technology wants you for research on Yoga & meditation",96,70mzlx,https://imgur.com/NF5ee1Y,23,,pakaomat," [deleted] Though myself vehemently oppose the zabardasti ka superior kulcha line. I have no issues with proper scientific research done to prove the benefits or ills of said kulcha.  The only problem I see is that the research will be done in a shoddy manner and hence be a waste of money. This is actually much needed. There are so many neuroscience studies on the effect of drugs, videogames, sex, tv, facebook etc on our brains - but different forms of meditation are not as studied. Each one would yield different results. It's time these were scientifically scrutinized.

 The only question is whether unsatisfactory results will be allowed to be published. > SATYAM

This government sure knows how to spin creative acronyms. Very welcoming! We should do more research on this rather than Harvard or Stanford.
There is a lot of research that these two institutions do inspite of yoga being an Indian thing. We should try to match them. Where's the problem OP? There are already many international universities researching the benefits of meditation on the brain. Why shouldn't India do it? Don't expect me to spit on something just because it's connected to religion and you have problems with it. *Disclaimer: If the paper shows yoga and meditation have no major impact on health The Truth Ministry will make sure the researcher get Vyapamed™. Please read the terms and conditions carefully before applying. BMJK. OP you are a scumbag. This project might actually help in getting rid of dumb pseudoscience and superstition associated with yoga and ayurveda. Stop dissing on Indian culture and arts just cos they dont fit your worldview, you goddamn pseudo-secular self-hating commie fake-liberal fake-scientific thinker. I dont mind the request from the ministry , what i worried here is how much of these research are going to be genuine , as there is more chance , few of the research later on can be used by this govt to support yoga and meditation being implemented ...like say while watching a movie in a theatre...

India will soon start producing first indigenous Lithium Ion batteries.
(Image: PIB)

India will soon start producing first indigenous Lithium Ion batteries. A
memorandum of understanding for transfer of technology for India’s first
Lithium Ion (Li-ion) Battery project was signed today between CSIR’s Central
Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI), Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu and RAASI
Solar Power Pvt Ltd.

According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, the indigenous technology
of Lithium-ion cells has been developed by a group of CSIR-CECRI headed by Dr
Gopu Kumar in partnership with CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL)
New Delhi, CSIR- Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute (CSIR-CGCRI)
Kolkata and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) Hyderabad.

“CSIR-CECRI has set up a demo facility in Chennai to manufacture prototype
Lithium-Ion cells. It has secured global IPRs with potential to enable cost
reduction, coupled with appropriate supply chain and manufacturing technology
for mass production,” a Science and Technology Ministry release said today.

At present India depends on countries like China, Japan and South Korea for
import of Lithium Ion batteries. India imported Li-Ion batteries worth $150
million in 2017 and is one of its largest importers in the world.

Speaking after the signing of MoUs, Union Science and technology minister
Harsh Vardhan said: “Today’s development is a validation of the capabilities
of CSIR and its laboratories to meet technology in critical areas to support
our industry, besides other sectors.”

The indigenous production of Li-Ion batteries is expected to boost Prime
Minister Modi flagship programmes like generating 175 Giga Watts of clean
energy by 2022 and National Electric Mobility Mission.

“It will give tremendous boost to two flagship programmes of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi – increasing the share of Clean Energy in the energy basket by
generating 175 Giga Watts by 2022, of which 100 Giga Watts will be Solar and
the second, National Electric Mobility Mission, to switch completely to
electric vehicles by 2030,” said Harsh Vardhan.

The project, the minister said, is also in tune with PM Modi’s vision of “Make
in India” to turn the country into ” a manufacturing hub and to cut down
outflow of foreign exchange.”

As per the MoU, Raasi Group will set up Li-Ion manufacturing facility in Tamil
Nadu’s Krishnagiri district, which is close to Bengaluru. The company aims to
bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs 15,000 per KW to replace
the Lead Acid batter. The company also plans to manufacture Li-Ion battery for
solar rooftop with life span of 25 years.

“We want to bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs. 15,000/- per
KW to replace Lead Acid Battery…“We also have plans to make Lithium Ion
battery for solar roof top with life span of 25 years to make it affordable
enough to drive the Photo Voltaic segment,” Raasi Group Chairman-cum-Managing
Director C Narsimhan said.

Why Lithium-Ion batteries:

Li-Ion batteries have applications in Energy Storage System – from hearing aid
to container sized batteries to power a cluster of villages, Electric Vehicles
(2-wheeler, 3-wheeler, 4-wheeler and Bus), portable electronic sector, Grid
Storage, Telecom and Telecommunication Towers, Medical Devices, Household and
Office Power Back (UPS), Powering Robots in Processing Industry.

Lithium-ion batteries can power any electrical application without the need of
physical wires-means wireless.

It is no surprise the only guilty Nazis who legally escaped judgement of Nuremberg trials happened to be scientists whom the Americans thought would give them an upper-hand over their soviet opponents.  Lelo achhe din BC!! >_< And so it begins. The time is not far off when IITians will be doing research on cow urine and cow dung. [removed] BC paagal gadhe sab ki sab. A board that propagates vedic science and ayurveda is going to oraganize a science fest in IIT fucking Delhi? What a joke!

I can't wait to see the look on my friend's face who is an alumni and aggressively supported Modi last year, along with other IIT cheerleaders, despite my warnings. He is a good friend, but chutiya hai saala. IIT Mumbai and the rest are laughing at you, IIT Delhi. People have been asking for opening more IIT-level colleges all over India, since the education in many colleges is sub-standard.

The government's brilliant idea is to downgrade the standard of IIT - then suddenly we will have thousands of colleges of ""same standard as IIT"".


/kulcha logic. How can they do this to my alma mater, these anti intellectual fucks.
Is there nothing we can do ? Where does this end. No society has ever progressed by looking at the past, and thats where we are heading, fucking stone age.
Do you guys even realise how bad this can get, this would negate 100 years of ""development"" promised by your dear supreme leader. 
 But why choose Indian institute of **technology** to do ayurveda and vedic science? Go to IISER to for science and some medical institute for ayurveda.

It's truly mind-blowing what OP has suggested.

Basically, this model has been there since 19th century and it was used to discipline kids and make them obedience.There has been no change ever since.Even though literacy rates of the west are higher,the quality of education has made many students drop out because it doesn't promote any creativity or critical thinking.The side effects of this are depression,ADHD and living unproductive life,of course.

What do you think of the solution they suggested?Do you want to add something to solution?

3.[Why is the US still using Prussian Education System](http://www.returnofkings.com/64892/why-is-the-united-states-still-using-the-prussian-education-system)

",edu_not_found," It boils down to the high expectations parents force on their wards. Often times it is about projecting their shortcomings on their children - 'Hey I wasn't able to crack this engineering\medicine course, I hope my child does it' So even without understanding what their child wants they go about forcing them to become who they were unable to be!

Although I agree that math and science is not the sole criteria for measuring a kid, I do believe we need it in our lives to understand things around us - what we can do is make it interesting in the lower standards, like a game, so that students don't feel it as a chore. My parents used this method and I found myself engaged in math & science from a very young age.

Even though US follows the Prussian model, they give a whole variety of other things for the child to choose from to help him/her identify their core competency. This is lacking in India though - athough there's a marked change recently albeit only for those who can afford it. The rest, as you pointed out, go through the 'industrial belt process' and come out as packaged cans unable to apply their minds critically let alone use what's stuffed inside! tldr: [Ken Robinson: Do schools kill creativity?](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity) That post is really a gem of a discovery OP!

What the post is suggesting is somewhat similar to Rabindranath Tagore's Shantiniketan Academy isn't it? I once an interview with Amartya Sen about how the eclectic environment of Shantiniketan shaped his mind, I've always been interested in the model of 'open', 'interest based' learning. Yes, some things are necessary and have to be compulsory - such as arithmetic and language, even if children are not interested in them.

But all other disciplines should be learned in a sort of mixed way. For example, why separate History and Literature? Why not study the great texts of the past to study about past society and learn the intricacies of great literature? I've always thought this would be an interesting approach. One could do the same for geography, learn stories from different places, then discuss the environment in which they take place.

Science should be more story based too, linked into history and literature, about how human discovered more and more about the world, leading to scientific revolution and the world of today.

All this can only happen when school occurs in a more relaxed atmosphere. I like the idea of not having rows, perhaps we should have more garden based learning, something like the Ashramas of old, with lessons and sport intermixing, with perhaps theatre and dance, singing, etc.

All this sounds too utopian, but maybe schools can start by designating one month for such kind of learning and see the results. Education needs reform though, even the most radical ideas should not be rejected out of hand. Wait the answer is not track all students using aadhar? /s Finlands made great strides in this area, look for talks by pasi sahlberg. I do not think reform is needed.
We just require better teachers.  > One way India could reform **it's** education

RSS made a deal with modi, if BJP comes to power they will dictate cultural agenda of the Government. Then they put their stooges in ministries that influence the following:

> school curricula, art and cinema, science and technology and libraries

That's why Smriti Irani is HRD minister instead of Yashwant Sinha or some qualified politician.

These stooges report direct to RSS and have regular meetings with people from RSS to give them progress cards and take directions from them.

Systematically all organisations have been taken over :

1. IITs (Baba Ramdev incident in IIT Delhi)
2. CBSE(Dinanath batra)
3. Censor board
4. History research grants commission
5. NSD
6. FTII
    and many others.

The most worrying part in all of this they have agendas for ""Science and Technology"" is part of their agenda.

Just read this article published in Nature:

http://www.dailyo.in/technology/narendra-modi-nature-journal-science-csir-madhukar-garg-icmr-greenpeace-biotech-space-research/story/1/3726.html

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Four-top-scientific-institutes-have-been-headless-for-months/articleshow/46649366.cms

To further their ""patriotism and hinduism"" agenda it means they need money and this is coming from budget cuts for research endeavours.

If somebody doesn't respect the international peer reviewed version of science & technology by calling it ""westernized"" then India will definitely fall behind others when budget cuts are made and research output is thought of as bogus ""westernized"" research. This can be seen by the fact that for the history research grants commission a person without one peer reviewed paper was made head.

Even highly patriotic countries with language barriers like Japan, South Korea and China believe in the international science system. 

If we go down this road further one has to believe that we will produce less and less scientific output and become like Pakistan or the middle east in terms of science and technology. kuch ni hoga. That's it. I'm outta here. I am against Indian Culture because these are the proponents of Arjuna as a great warrior and Drona as a great student. Mahabali was a just ruler and all people were without caste or creed yet he was banished to pathala because he dared challenge the Aryans. Actually, Ekalavya was better than Arjuna and Drona and we should have named awards after him. Indian Culture encouraged giving girls to sexual slavery in temples and It was Amy Carmichael who rescued them. Yet not a single university is named after her. Ida Scudder was a great soul yet no one in India has recognized her efforts in bringing about CMC vellore. BOth Ida and Amy were foreign Christian Missionaries and because of that the Indian society has ostracized them. Shame on this Indian Society. I want Modi's BJP and Congress to recognize this and give Bharat Ratna to both Ida Scudder and Amy Carmichael. I am a low caste and I would like to thank Indian Society for calling me a melecha because I eat beef and pork. to cleanse western cullture we have to throw away the atomic knowledge gained from westerners like James Chadwick and  Thomson. Besides this RSS people want to live in 13 th century  So they are going to ban Idol worshiping and arraigned marriages, English language and computers ?  Wouldn't this be cause problems to his Make-in-India plan? Every time we vote, we get idiots. Elections are guaranteed to give us idiots. Why vote? ""So does western culture also include the intense consumerism driven by neo-liberal economics? The same consumerism which is destroying the environment, driving inequality and creating more slave labor everyday?""

""Oh no, that we love about the west, we just mean rap music""  What else would you expect from an illiterate idiot who did not even pass 10th standard? This country of idiots deserves this. My children will not be growing up in this shit-hole. What a generic piece of crap is this. OP paka mat yaar  Except for hedonism and embracing promiscuity as the norm ,I feel western culture is just inherently superior. So they are going to ban Idol worshiping and arraigned marriages, English language and computers ?  Wrong priorities.

The only thing they should do is to remove English and reinstate Sanskrit as the lingua franca of India. And remove the Congi pro-British propaganda still being taught in schools.

Also, haters please note - there is a big difference between Lingua Franca and Majority Language. Two completely different concepts. Lingua franca is what you use when you converse with someone who doesn't understand your mother tongue (like many Indians use English today to speak to each other, Europeans used French earlier, etc.), majority language is just the language that becomes widespread and is spoken by a lot of people.

What I want is Sanskrit to replace English as the means of conversation between people from Indian states and language zones.",Science/Technology,2015-09-09 19:53:41
What are the websites that cover science & technology news focussing on India?,19,5vouxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5vouxk/what_are_the_websites_that_cover_science/,16,"Like verge.com, wired.com etc.",monsoon_man," You won't get anything spectacular because science & technology is pretty much united. So, all English speakers use the same site. Chinese and Russians have their own.

Indian contribution to science and technology is very minimum. So, there are not many Indian specific websites. But, in most English websites, you will find a small group of Indians.

IISc debuts in top 100 world university ranking.,138,3sj9dg,http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/education/iisc-debuts-in-top-100-world-university-ranking/article7869064.ece,42,,pradeep_sinngh," Regardless of the good news, it is hard to trust a list that gives a higher research score to NUS than MIT.  [deleted] ""Lund"" is ahead of IISc. :D Fuck yeah

PS - Always take these rankings with a pinch of salt. They are very much anglo-saxon oriented and each of them use different metrics. 
For e.g. - If you consider Munich or Berlin or Zürich, they in the Germanic tradition separate universities of basic learning and universities of technology, which the UK and US mostly don't. All of their big unis do research in and teach all disciplines. But say for .e.g in IISc or at the University of Munich, you don't do technology. That's the domain of the technical universities (Technische Hochschulen or Technische Universitäten). If you club them together, then Munich and Berlin would rank in the top 25 based on pure research output and impact. But most of these rankings also consider things like the ratio of international students and gender equality and social impact etc. 

If you want to do a good intensive Master's programme and then a PhD, choose a smaller university. The instructors are more hands-on. I studied at the Uni of Munich and except 2 professors, all the other big guys sent in their post-docs to teach. A friend of mine did her MSc in Neuroscience at the Uni of Edinburgh, and it was just 1 year and just 3 months of thesis. They hardly learnt anything general; it was way too focussed on a few particular topics. And in the same way, choose a doctoral advisor (PI) who is an up and coming star instead of a well-established professor, because the younger guy will be more hands-on because he is in line for big grants and a future Chair at a big Uni.  There was another ranking a few weeks back where the IITs were ranked at 600 right? So is this another ranking? Thanks in advance for clarifying.  IISc: 19 : 81 Female:Male Ratio [deleted] And this institute had to bend over because of ego of the current government. It's a shame that such nice institutes cannot freely decide how they want to teach. The Indian Institute of Science Bangalore is the first Indian university to enter the list.

Bengaluru: View: A compelling case to have Bengaluru as second Indian capital,0,7s3r2j,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/view-a-compelling-case-to-have-bengaluru-as-second-capital/articleshow/62583461.cms,3,,Luciferslair," No pls.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**View: A compelling case to have Bengaluru as second Indian capital** 

 ______ 
** By Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw **** **

The recent suggestion by

RV Deshpande

, Karnataka's minister for large &amp; medium industries and infrastructure
development, that

Bengaluru

be given the status of a second capital of

India

has sparked off an interesting debate.

For a country as vast and ethnically diverse as India, I believe there is a
compelling case to create a southern capital for all the reasons that
Deshpande has outlined in his letter to the prime minister.

The concept of two capital cities is not uncommon: nearly 15 countries across
the world have multiple capitals. For instance, Bolivia, Georgia and the
Netherlands have two capitals! South Africa has three capitals — Bloemfontein,
Cape Town, and Pretoria — that house its judicial, legislative and executive
branches.

Bengaluru's strongest claim to being India's second capital lies in its status
as the country's science and technology (S&amp;T) hub. It's only our
scientific prowess that can help propel India into a higher growth orbit.

Bengaluru boasts a mature S&amp;T ecosystem, which has attracted several MNCs
to invest in the city to conduct their R&amp;D operations. The government,
industry and academia here have provided the impetus for the development of
the S&amp;T sector in terms of the availability of a scientific workforce,
world-class R&amp;D infrastructure and investor-friendly policies.

The information technology and biotechnology booms have engendered a strong
entrepreneurial culture in the city. Bengaluru is already the ""Science
Capital"", ""Startup Capital"", ""IT Capital"" and ""Biotechnology Capital"" of the
country.

By proposing it as a second capital, the intent is not to duplicate the
administrative infrastructure with overlapping jurisdictions, but rather to
have a more efficient and optimal distribution of ministries between New Delhi
and Bengaluru. It means leveraging the core competence of Bengaluru as India's
Knowledge Capital.

The city possesses the kind of intellectual capital that can drive the
evolution of forward-looking, next-generation policies that will enable India
to leapfrog to global leadership in S&amp;T. There is a strong case for
implementing over the next five years a plan to relocate the science-related
ministries from New Delhi to Bengaluru. These ministries will benefit
immensely from the scientific culture of the city. It will also help the
government in keeping its ear to the ground when formulating policies.

The success of India's space programmes is due in large measure to the
Department of Space being based in Bengaluru. Housing the ministries of
science &amp; technology and electronics &amp; information technology in
Bengaluru would throw open many new avenues for closer collaboration that can
lead to greater success of these sectors. For instance, agencies like Unique
Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), if located in Bengaluru, can
benefit immensely from the large IT ecosystem and the rising status of the
city as the data science hub of the country.

As India's Science Capital, Bengaluru can be the epicentre for pushing India
towards a more digital and formalised economy, while enabling e-governance and
participatory policy-making through the government's

Digital India

initiative. Currently, the southern states feel alienated when it comes to a
redress of issues and policymaking.

As a second centre of administrative power, Bengaluru can help ease the burden
of governance through greater expediency and efficiency.

By giving Bengaluru the status of India's second capital, not only will the
Indian government help unleash the huge potential of the country's innovative
S&amp;T prowess, it will also send out a strong signal that the South is a
very integral part of the country.

Sending them off to prove batshit crazy theories. Solid plan. Why, BJP- why so stupid ??! ಠ_ಠ Facepalm news of the year. This is what happens when the director is [appointed by the government](http://www.ibtimes.co.in/take-lessons-ancient-sages-they-were-probably-great-scientists-manohar-parrikar-tells-drdo-647834). This is nothing new. Last year they harping about [intel gathering in the vedas](http://www.dailyo.in/politics/how-the-drdo-is-riding-the-saffron-chariot-to-please-modi/story/1/1238.html), and before that they wanted to [hire this idiot](http://swamykujrananda.blogspot.in/2010/05/fast-yogi-how-stupid-is-media.html), to train soldiers to survive without food and water. Why DRDO? Why? Why do you have to be like this? Look at your brother over there. Why can't you be more like him? Such a waste of DRDO resources. We really need some private investors to boost research because successive governments have proven useless.  Its because of idiots like these that sometimes its embarrassing to call ourselves Indians yes, good preparation for WW4.

**India thinking fast forward** India’s premier defence research agency’s missile tech unit signs an MoU with the Tirumala temple to conduct scientific research on Vedas. We bet the next Science Congress would be even more bizarre

> * India's premier defence research agency's missile tech unit signs an MoU with the Tirumala temple to conduct scientific research on Vedas.

> * Now, the Narendra Modi government is taking it all to the logical end.India's premier defence research agency the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) has gone right ahead to sign a memorandum of understanding with the cash-rich Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) to conduct scientific research on the Vedas to scout for possible secrets pertaining to missile technologies hidden in the ancient scriptures.The MoU with TTD was signed by the Hyderabad-based Research Centre Imarat (RCI)-DRDO to conduct scientific research on the Vedas.

> * But nothing has been conclusively proved so far.In fact, a 1974 study titled ""A critical study of the work Vymanika Shastra"" (Science of aeronautics),conducted by researchers of the Indian Institute of Science into 'ancient scriptures' pertaining to aviation technologies claimed to have been handed down by Sage Bharadwaj, were actually found to be a modern works, somewhere between 1918 and 1923.The study, which was then published in the journal Scientific Opinion on four 'planes' described in Vymanika Shastra - Shakuna Vimana, Sundara Vimana, Rukma Vimana and Tripura Vimana - and claimed to have been given by the ancient sage, were at best ""poor concoctions rather than expressions of something real"".

> * ""None of the planes has properties or capabilities of being flown; the geometries are unimaginably horrendous from the point of view of flying; and the principles of propulsion make them resist rather than assist (in) flying,"" the researchers said in their study's conclusions.They also concluded that the texts and the drawings did not correlate with each other ""even thematically"", suggesting that such claims were only figments of imagination by the author.Similarly, none of the mythological claims to high-end technologies in the ancient Indian past have found scientific basis despite various studies being conducted on the issue.The TTD has established the Centre for Veda Science Research (CVSR) for promoting research in the field and has recognised seven patasalas as 'centres of excellence' in Vedic studies to give a fillip to oral tradition of dissemination of Vedas.Eminent scientists will guide the project, but no further details were available on who they might be.The President inaugurated a new Veda Pathasala (school) set up by the TTD at I Bheemavaram village in Akiveedu Mandal of West Godavari district.The TTD has constructed I Bheemavaram Vedic School at a cost of Rs 4.7 crore.

I'm as much of a BJP detractor as anyone you'll find. But at the same time, there are a few things I know:

* Yoga has legit benefits

* Meditation is known to change thought patterns. Legit shit.

* Not all ayurveda is quackery. Head over to /r/nootropics and read about how different ayurvedic herbs act as nootropics. Sure, it won't save you from cancer, but some of this stuff has benefits. 


Nothing wrong with studying any of these in detail. Ministry of Pseudoscience Excellent use of state resources.

> * While the US, Russia, China and others are leagues ahead in the race to develop advanced DEWs, though their actual operational deployment is still some distance away, India is also trying to make some headway towards such futuristic weapons.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is already tom-tomming its ongoing development of a 10-kilowatt DEW against UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) like targets, with ""the establishment of critical technologies of precision tracking/pointing and laser beam combination"".The ""system"" has been tested up to a range of 800 meters at its Hyderabad-based Centre for High Energy Systems and Sciences (CHESS), and was also demonstrated to the armed forces at the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory's firing range at Ramgarh (Haryana) in September last year.Development of DEWs and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons has been identified as a top-priority area in the 15-year ""technology perspective and capability roadmap"" chalked out by the defence ministry, as reported by TOI earlier.The DRDO, often criticised for huge time and cost overruns in its projects, says smaller systems like laser-based ordnance disposal of IEDs and mines, hand-held laser dazzlers to overpower armed terrorists and vehicle-mounted laser dazzlers for controlling unruly mobs have already been developed.But the real challenge will be in achieving the declared aim to develop solid-state laser DEWs for aircraft and warships, which can destroy enemy ballistic missiles in their ""boost phase itself"", somewhat akin to what is already being tested by the US.The DRDO's Laser Science & Technology Centre is working on an array of systems from ""chemical oxygen iodine lasers"" to ""high-power fiber lasers"" for st-rategic uses, which includes a 25-kilowatt laser to take on a ballistic missile du-ring its ""terminal phase"" at a distance of 5-7 km.All this has gained momentum after the government in February 2014 sanctioned Rs 115 crore for de-velopment of ""experimental technology modules for directed energy laser syst-ems"" by CHESS, with the project completion date being set for July 2017.

Calculus created in India 250 years before Newton: study - Technology & Science,143,2p81f0,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/calculus-created-in-india-250-years-before-newton-study-1.632433,146,,sjain75," Awesome! I read about this sometime back, but it was speculation and not the conclusion of a study then.

Anyone interested in reading viewpoints such as of these researchers should read The Indian Clerk, a book about Ramanujan and his time in England. People are arguing that the Taylor series was proof of invention of calculus. Bitch pls. Be proud if you want to but get your facts right.

While I understand that the Taylor series is a very important concept in calculus, it isn't necessary to combine the ideas of infinitesimal sums and differences, convergence, divergence and limits to get to it. The form newton and leibnitz fought over inventing was one which had these concepts (as evidenced by newton promptly using it for his kinematics work).

So no, in the true sense, I wouldn't call this the invention of calculus. But it's an absolutely important step there nonetheless... something which neither newton nor leibnitz had set eyes on, so careful before you start accusing them of plagiarizing.  These are REAL Indian achievements. I have no idea why the wingnuts insist on tom-tomming the Taj as a Shiv mandir when there actually are real things to be proud of.  Really, this is new? I thought Madhava and the taylor series has been known for a quite a while now. Newton wasn't even the 1st European to develop the calculus.  A better title would be ""Medieval scientists in Kerala invented Infinite Series centuries before the West"".

This is indeed admirable, but please do remember that calculus isn't just about infinite series, the concept of limits, infinitesimal small changes and their infinite sums is crucial. Infinite series is just one part of the stepping stones to calculus.

Regardless, this is definitely something to be proud about. It's interesting to see proper research into the Indian history of the maths, sciences and economics; since this is severely lacking in our narratives of history. However, using clickbaity headlines is a bit disingenuous, but to be expected. It is a 2007 article, going by the date.

>""There were many reasons why the contribution of the Kerala school has not been acknowledged,"" he said. ""A prime reason is neglect of scientific ideas emanating from the Non-European world, a legacy of European colonialism and beyond.""

>However, he concedes there are other factors also in play.

>""There is also little knowledge of the medieval form of the local language of Kerala, Malayalam, in which some of most seminal texts, such as the Yuktibhasa, from much of the documentation of this remarkable mathematics is written,"" he admits.

I think Mr Gevarghese George, who sounds like an Indian, has got his primes mixed up. The Brits were rather interested in what we had discovered and what we believed, if the Journal of the Asiatic Society is anything to go by. I would say that the prime reason is what he accepts as 'other factors', something for which the blame lies squarely at our own feet.

I think we have done much more than just this - in Advanced Mathematics and Astronomy. And then let it all go to seed ... This is mentioned in Wikipedia. 

>In the 14th century, Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics stated components of calculus such as the Taylor series and infinite series approximations. However, they were not able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the powerful problem-solving tool we have today

The researcher of this article is George Gheverghese Joseph from Kerala. 

 V INVANTED CALCULUSS [removed] Shocked that I haven't seen a **so prod v invant** comment here so far. 

Anyway, now that Western scientists have put this matter to rest, I am sure our fellow randians are convinced. Otherwise we would have seen a bunch of disparaging comments about the people who say anything along these lines. Secular feathers will be ruffled. Kya ukhaad liya calculus invent karke Everytime someone comes out with statements like this (especially if they are right), the natural question that arises is - then what the f*** are we doing with our garbage heap of an education system, rote learning, utter absence of creativity, and spectacles like a daytime drama queen (literally) as the person in charge of education, chokehold of bureaucracy, anaemic support for higher education, and research (0.7% vs. 3% of GDP that all of our competitors have)? It must have been invented we had a very skilled and glorious past. Even scientists today r baffled by indian architecture which was created in past. The ashoka pillar is the iron pillar standing in open since years without any rust, and taj mahal ajanta ellora paintings etcetc. But sad truth is today we are a third world country with poverty population explosion and corruption. Just coz ur father was a rich n successfull businessman doesnt mean u keep on doing nothing and encash on his name hope this is clear Not sure, why we always want to compare our civilization with western one. Seems like we still have the inferiority complex because western one ruled over us. 

We know  India is one of the oldest and great civilization. A lot of was discovered and invented in India. But can we focus on how what we are today. Even if Calculus was created in India, no one can deny that Leibniz, Newton and western civilization reinvented it, documented it, promoted it, applied it and made it part of math curriculum. 

So even if India  created calculus, stop finding reasons for how great we were, and discuss on how can be great today.
 Calculus is INDIAN^Mlecch_Certified where is the anti kulcha people now Doesn't matter, because Issac Newton was Indian too. He was kidnapped from Yamuna vaidhshalaya (university) and brainwashed by white people. His real name was Isayu Nathuram. Look it up on Subramanian Swamy's facebook page if you don't beleive me. So we inveneted calculus either way. so prod of r kulcha Doesn't matter. Issac Newton (Ishant Nutan) was actually of Indian origin. His father had emigrated from India.  That is why his father forced Ishant to learn Sanskrit which was responsible for Ishant creating Calculus.

Prime minister Narendra Modi’s pledge to place India among the top three countries in the world in the field of science and technology (S&T) by 2030—announced at the Indian Science Congress in Tirupati earlier this month and reiterated at the Nobel prize exhibition in Ahmedabad this week—is a fine sentiment. But it is also a grandiose one. Getting even part-way there is going to take some doing. India performs below its potential on just about every indicator of scientific progress and achievement there is: be it the amount of public and private funding earmarked for research, the number of prestigious awards won by Indian scientists working in Indian institutions, the number of patents registered in the names of Indians or the number of articles published in well-known peer-reviewed journals.

India has a long civilizational history of scientific achievement. But today the list of Indian scientists who have won the world’s most prestigious award, the Nobel, begins and ends with C.V. Raman. The longer list of Indian-origin and Indian-born winners has 16 mentions—but that also only highlights the large-scale systemic failures that extend across institutions and manifest at all levels.

Only time will tell if the Modi government will be able to put in motion the revamp he has spoken of. But for now, there are early indicators that give us some idea of the government’s plans and priorities.

First is the government’s focus on improving science education at the school level: In Ahmedabad, Modi spoke of scientists helping develop course modules while in Tirupati, he mentioned scientific social responsibility wherein premier laboratories and research institutions could partner with nearby schools and colleges to create an environment that supports scientific education and innovation. This is well and good. But these are in the nature of vague, broad ideas, when what is needed is foundational work on the overall education system.

A human resource and development ministry report tabled in Parliament last month noted that as many as a million teaching positions in government schools across the country are lying vacant; successive status of education reports by the non-profit Pratham have highlighted how educational outcomes among Indian school students are falling at an alarming rate.

The situation in institutions of higher education is hardly any better. Elite institutions such as the IITs are the exception, and they too struggle to compete globally. In the QS World University Rankings 2016-17, only two Indian institutions ranked among the top 200 universities in the world: Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (rank 152) and Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (rank 185). Research institutions also suffer from government interference and lack of funding which, among other problems, makes them unattractive to rising talent that prefers greener pastures abroad.

The second issue that the government is focusing on is strengthening the links between S&T and industry. If done right, this could potentially bring in the resources necessary to boost Indian science. Currently, much of the funding comes from the government while private-sector investment (in the form of research and development centres, for example) is below par. Overall, despite talk since the late 1980s of increasing S&T investments from the public and private sector to 2% of GDP (gross domestic product), the figure still hovers at around 0.9%. In comparison, South Korea leads the race, investing 3% of its GDP in S&T, while Japan follows close behind.

Another example is tiny Israel, which has not only nurtured a flourishing S&T ecosystem but leveraged its security challenges to build a robust defence industry. In India, it will be interesting to see if the Modi government’s flagship scheme to boost domestic manufacturing and its consequent efforts to woo foreign capital (specifically in defence) can do something similar.

Against this backdrop, it was perhaps in the fitness of things that the Nobel exhibition, which brought nine Nobel laureates on one platform in Ahmedabad, was organized in association with an investment summit to underline how science, technology and innovation hold the key to enterprise and entrepreneurship. The event is part of the larger Nobel Prize Series—and can be seen as part of the government’s larger effort to make science more glamorous. But talk is cheap. If there is to be real progress, it will need unglamorous, ground-level work. Fetishizing the Nobel as an end in itself—as Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu did last week when he announced Rs100 crore in prize money for anyone from his state who wins the prize—will not be enough.

With Smriti Irani, you could have gotten something memorable like:

""Indian pundits had flown to Pluto in a vimaana and mapped the surface. It surprisingly looks like my arse. Brown, round, cold, and with almost nothing substantial ever coming out of it. So, when people think that I insult academicians by yelling at them, I am actually trying to make them into modern astronomers by asking them to lick and observe my fat arse at close quarters. If it was not against our kulcha, I would moon you all.""

The Lucknow University Senate needs to be careful about quality control. Maybe schedule their convocations when Irani is available?

/s Wow. It's crappy articles like this that make even rightful BJP-bashing seem uncalled for. This is a case of extremely bad paraphrasing.

[Here's](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/home-minister-rajnath-singh-hails-ancient-indian-contributions-to-science-maths/articleshow/45940516.cms) the same story from The Economic Times in case anyone's interested. > ""Many times our media is confused. They say that US observatory has informed about lunar and solar eclipse on a particular date...Don't look at an observatory, ask any Pundit next to you. They will open the 'Panchang' (Hindu calendar) and tell you the dates of eclipse 100 year ago and also 100 years hence,"" Rajnath Singh said while addressing the convocation of Lucknow University here, reported PTI.

The title is clickbait-y but who gives a crap if a pundit can tell you when the eclipse is? Why does it matter. 

>""Our saints had said that earth existed 1.96 arab (billion) years ago. Earlier, science did not accept this but later it had to. What they tell is run by our channels. They should have asked Pundits,"" he said praising ancient Indian knowledge.

Just a simple google search shows that the age of Earth is ~4.5 billion years old. That's why science didn't accept it. Do speechwriters even fact check?

>Stating that no other country possesses the knowledge, which India has, Rajnath Singh said be it theorems of trigonometry, algebra or others no other country could match our knowledge.

I think anyone with a math textbook can match our knowledge. It's not some closely guarded secret. If he's talking about historically, then it's out of my area of knowledge. 

>""When knowledge is cut-off from traditional values, it becomes disastrous. Civilizations which get cut-off from their traditions and values do not survive for long. It was India which showed a big heart and gave message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family),"" he said.

Uhh what? I think history has shown that, people who stick to their ""traditions"" instead of adapting to a changing world, are the ones who die out. 

>Objecting to ""hi and bye culture"", the minister asked students not to indulge in it and instead follow traditions and touch feet of their parents and elders.

>""Today, youths say 'hi and bye' even to their parents. Instead, they should touch parents' feet as a mark of respect,"" Singh said, adding that ""Jo jhukna nahi jaante, woh toot jaate hain"".

LOL. 

If I had to listen to this sanctimonious bullshit on my graduation day then I would seriously annoyed. Reads like a love letter to a kulcha warrior. This is worse than the last graduation I went to when I had to hear Sashi Tharoor bloviate about his foreign trips and people he met.  everyone please join the anti right circlejerk thread, let us all bash the chaddis. 

no /s Actually our vedas and culture contain all knowlez about everything in the universe. The west stole everything and looted the sone ki chidiya that was once bharat. They not only looted this knowlez but also our wealth and make peoples suffer.  I feel like banging my head on the wall right now. >they will open the 'Panchang' (Hindu calendar) and tell you the dates of eclipse 100 year ago and also 100 years hence

Well... Isn't that true? I thought the Hindu calendar had accurately calculated eclipse dates?

Also, I'm having trouble finding the direct quote where he says that ""An Indian pundit know more about lunar and solar eclipses than any US observatory""

I just want to exercise a little caution before jumping on the ""ZOMG V INVANT"" bandwagon And this guy has a Masters in Physics *sigh*",Science/Technology,2015-01-20 00:57:16

>* NEW DELHI: The government will invest close to Rs 500 crore to set up research parks, technological business incubators and startup centres in premier educational institutes like the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and National Institute of Technology, according to a senior official.These institutes had recently made proposals to the ministry of human resources development and the department of science and technology (DST) for such facilities.The official cited earlier told ET that the HRD ministry has committed Rs 50-80 crore towards over Rs 100 crore needed for each research park while the department of science and technology is likely to invest close to Rs 100 crore for setting up of technology business incubators (TBIs) and startup centres.The funds will be released when the institutes are ready, the official said.

>* Six institutes are likely to get funds for research parks including the IIT campuses in Delhi, Kanpur, Hyderabad, Gandhinagar and Guwahati, and IISc Bangalore.At present, only the IIT campuses in Chennai, Kharagpur and Mumbai have research parks.

>* The official said the move to fund such centres will help the institutes generate additional revenue with creation of intellectual property rights (IPRs).An official at DST said the government has raised the budget for innovation and entrepreneurship to Rs 180 crore from Rs 40 crore last year.

>* However, the institute's director, SK Das, said, ""We are internally ready for a research park and intend to push for this again.

>* We are asking for centres/schools focused on specific domains, named chairs, and so on,"" said IIT Madras director Bhaskar Ramamurthi.

 I will forever be grateful to BJP if they let Hinduism alone. But who am I kidding?  But 2002!

Modi's haters will keep scaremongering about how he will start an orgy of Muslim blood and destroy India.

And whenever he proves them wrong(which is always) they will desperately go back and rake up 2002 again.

This will be their fate for the remainder of their natural lives. They will still be talking about 2002 in 2052. Fuck the elections. You want to see who wins? See who's the friendliest towards the West. Which almost always means they ignore the people. The US has all of their telemarketers and troubleshooters here, they dump all their plastic garbage not far from Chennai, and we provide Trillions in education money and then we stay back there to fill their coffers. 

Meanwhile ours is rapidly a dumping ground of the dregs of the human gene pool. The intelligent procreate less, or emigrate, therefore they will be evolved out of the gene pool.

  By Amit Kapoor  

 

  A special ""Nobel Series"" session was a notable addition at the latest Vibrant Gujarat Summit (January 9-12).  

 

  Nine laureates were invited to share their thoughts about the challenges of humankind and what could be done to alleviate them. A Nobel exhibition is housed in Ahmedabad's Science City for five weeks post the summit. The scientists discussed the importance of science and technology for India to become a knowledge superpower. They also interacted with students and shared their research and general approach to science and technology.  

 

  While all this bodes well for the rise of Indian states in the global arena, what is important is that, of late, Indian states are recognising the need for not only inviting creative individuals but also trying to enable an ecosystem that helps people grow and make the best of every opportunity.  

 

  A question is: Why foster science and technology or even creativity? Many scholars, economists and public policy professionals have devoted considerable time on understanding the sources of a nation's prosperity. Some of them opine that economic prosperity arises as a result of ""institutions"" while others argue that factors like endowments and geographic location are equally important. More recently, other scholars believe that productivity is the basis of economic growth and prosperity.  

 

  Recently, scholars like Richard Florida of the Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI) at the University of Toronto have pointed out that the rise of the ""creative class"" could help explain the prosperity and economic development in some parts and the lack of it in other parts of the world. ""Creative class"", according to Florida, is a group of people engaged in creative occupations. These people, when given the right environment and ecosystem, enable innovation, which is the main driving force for economic development.  

 

  Urbanisation and the progress in technology over the past two/three centuries have meant that the flow of ideas and sharing of information can now be done much more quickly. This has led to the rise of the knowledge economy.  

 

  For tracking these developments, Florida and his MPI team have created a Global Creativity Index. The report is based on the 3T framework that forms the basis of economic progress within the city/state -- Tolerance, Talent and Technology -- that in turn leads to economic prosperity. If one looks at the most recent version of the Global Creativity Report 2015 one finds that most developed economies perform well -- Australia is on top, followed by the US, while Singapore, the only Asian nation in the top 10, is at 9, followed by the Netherlands. Also the share of the creative class in many North American and West European countries is closer to 40 percent.  

 

  Contrast this with India's performance -- 99th in a list of 120+ nations -- and there is scope for tremendous improvement. One of the reasons for this low performance is that the share of the creative class is quite low in India. This is due to an issue of quality education and skilling and outflow of people who receive good education. Less than five percent of the Indian workforce is formally skilled. The gross enrolment ratio is also quite low in India.  

 

  India is relatively good in the technology component but bad in the tolerance and talent domains. Even the BRICS as a block is not especially impressive with a diverse range of rankings. Brazil ranks the highest in the Creativity Index within the block at 29. Russia is outstandingly bad in the tolerance aspect.  

 

  The Institute for Competitiveness and Martin Prosperity Institute had previously tied up for research on India's ""Creative Class"". The research and ranking of the Creative Economy of Indian States was done recently.  

 

  The broad findings remain the same as last year. This year we have added a classification of Union Territories and separation from other states.  

 

  Delhi and Chandigarh retain rank 1 and 2, respectively, in the city-states/Union Territory category. Punjab moves to top spot this year from the previous years' third position (in the main states index) pushing down Kerala and Goa. States like Bihar and Orissa are bad performers overall and but have tremendous opportunity to move up in the years to come.  

 

  The maximum negative variation is found in states like Himachal Pradesh, which has moved down six places. Haryana has seen an upward movement of seven places, thus showing significant improvement in performance. States that have moved up in the ranking include Gujarat and Karnataka. The rankings among the Union Territories remained unchanged from the last year.  

 

  In the years ahead, India's economic prosperity will be driven by states and Union Territories and locations and cities within these that are creative. States that do well to foster the creative class will in turn be instrumental in driving innovation and economic progress.

Need $5 billion more to make biotech a $100 billion sector: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw,29,45cxxj,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/need-5-billion-more-to-make-biotech-a-100-billion-sector-kiran-mazumdar-shaw/articleshow/50918288.cms,7,,indianwi," This sounds like the content of some spam mail.

Give so much of money, and you'll have THIS MUCH! So BioCon wants the government to setup more research centers and universities? Does BioCon fund any professor chairs or labs today? If not, then all they are asking is taxpayers money to be spent in research which could then be sold by corporations for profits. I could be simplifying. Correct me if I'm wrong. Need $5 billion more to make biotech a $100 billion sector: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw

>* BENGALURU: Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw today said it will take an investment worth $5 billion in biotechnology to realise the target of making it a $100 billion sector by 2025.

>* ""Today, biotechnology is a $11 billion sector, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 20 per cent.

>* We also are aspiring to be a $100 billion sector by 2025,"" Mazumdar-Shaw said.Though this seems a ""fairly daunting task"", she said, adding that ""by investing in human capital and in the sector alone in terms of infrastructure and other research initiatives, I think we can actually deliver on this aspiration.

>* ""Mazumdar-Shaw, also the Chairperson of Karnataka Vision Group on Biotechnology, was speaking at the inauguration of 16th edition of 'Bangalore India Bio 1016' here.The event was also attended by Union Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan and Secretary in Department of Biotechnology K Vijay Raghavan, among others.Stating that India's investment in science and technology is at suboptimal level, she called on the government to invest more.

>* ""We request you (Harsh Vardhan) to push the government to make sure that our investment in science and technology only grows and increases, because this is the future of India, this is what will give us demographic dividend from our scientists,"" she added.The three-day long ""Bangalore India Bio"" will be covering various spectrum of activities including multi track conferences, international trade show, key note talks, poster sessions, bio invest, global biotech conclave, among others.She said to dominate in the field such as biotechnology and information technology what is paramount is human capital, which will actually shape India's science and technology prowess in the world.

"Universities must have more academic freedom, autonomy, says PM Narendra Modi",29,2r7wrb,http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/universities-must-have-more-academic-freedom-autonomy-says-pm-narendra-modi/1/214202.html,14,,janupbhoteyojana," >**""We want our scientists to explore the mysteries of science and not of government procedure,""** Modi said, while inaugurating the 102nd Indian Science Congress in Mumbai.
""Our institutions of research must become more broad based. Our universities must have a higher degree of academic freedom and autonomy,"" Modi said.
**In turn the universities must also subscribe to highest standards of academic excellence and accountability**, Modi said.

We'll have to wait to find out what that emboldened bit means in terms of specifics I guess...

On the administrative policy aspect

> ""As the major source of science and technology, government must do its part. When I speak of ease of doing business in India, I also want to pay equal attention to the ease of doing research and development in India,"" Modi said.

and

>**The Prime Minister said each government department should have an officer focusing on science and technology relating to its area of work and, allocate a percentage of its budget for such activities.**

(Awesome!)

and

>""We have to place the university system at the cutting edge of the research and development activities in the country,"" he added.

... as opposed to moribund government institutes? Cool. One difference being access to student population, and their talents. This demographic is still unencumbered by the livelihood phase, and is living in a setting where their only real responsibility is to learn. (Leading to a system where enthusiasm is fostered, rather than let wither)

Moving on... the PM, *possibly* on the parenting and socio-cultural aspect, says

>Emphasising the need to popularise science and technology, he said, ""Our children should see role models in scientists as much as in sportsmen.""

&
 
>""You will have no better supporter than me. In turn, I seek your help in transforming India,"" Modi said as he told the scientific community that their achievements should be celebrated ""as much as we rejoice in our success in other areas"".
""We need to put science, technology and innovation at the top of national priorities. Above all, we must restore the pride and prestige of science and scientists in our nation,"" the Prime Minister said.

A re-iteration of the publicly-acknowledged (though spurned in private) view. I still would like someone to simply pitch the awesomeness of science to the public - as a standalone... and not tied to pride, or its use for development, or national supremacy... but I guess this'll do for now.

Modi on the legislative policy aspect.

>He also called for clear regulatory policies for research and development in areas like biotechnology, nano-science, agriculture and clinical research.

There are other issues too, but his mention has now gotten me thinking: what is the Hindu religion stand on stem-cell research? (Or abortion for that matter?) Or genetic modification etc. etc.?

The PM's other observations in the developmental/fiscal/economical aspects

>A nation's progress and development is linked to science, Modi said.

&

>The Prime Minister called upon Indian industry to step up investments in science and technology in its own interest.

&

> **He said India's own pharmaceutical industry has carved out a place for itself in the world, because it invests significantly in research.**

(Are you listening, industry?)

>China's emergence as the second biggest economy is parallel to that country's strides in science and technology, he added.

The usual stuff, but I think I hear Western Pharma company CEOs, the WTO, and western patent lawyers turning in their graves. (They can continue to do so AFAI'm concered though). But yes, do Indian pharma firms really invest that much in R&D? As in IP generating R&D? As opposed to number-crunching processing/experimentation centres that use cheaper labour, without requiring this labour to do their own directed thinking.

Anyway, he goes on to recognise the historical approach to S&T policy, as well as offer his two cents.

>Modi asked the scientists to incorporate traditional local knowledge to develop more appropriate, effective, sustainable and affordable technologies that contribute immensely to development and progress.
He said the arms of science, technology and innovation must reach the poorest, the remotest and the most vulnerable person.
The PM also felicitated Nobel laureates and Indian scientists on the occasion.

**India and Portugal sign 11 agreements: All you need to know about them** 

 ______ 
India and Portugal recently announced a four million euros joint fund to bolster research in science and technology as Prime Minister Narendra Modi held in-depth talks with his Portuguese counterpart on cooperation in areas like counter-terrorism, space, climate studies and start-ups.

In a joint address to the media after signing 11 bilateral agreements, Modi and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, who traces his origin to Goa, said the two countries have made substantial progress since Costa visited India in January.

The agreements signed included cooperation in outer space, double taxation avoidance, nano technology, improving cultural ties, youth and sports, higher education, scientific research, and setting up of a Portugal-India Business Hub and an Indian Chamber of Commerce.

How will these pacts benefit India?

The goal of the Centre is to provide a shared environment to foster new climate, earth, space and marine research

With respect to space, cooperation is expected to include development and cooperation of next generation nano and micro satellites

On marine sciences, the project would enable India to study the atmospheric and ocean behaviour of the Atlantic and its linkages with weather patterns including the monsoon

On joint science and technology fund of 4 million euros:

Speaking on collaboration in cutting-edge technology, Modi announced the setting up of a joint science and technology fund of four million euros. ""Our economic ties continue to follow an upward trajectory, and we can do more for the flow of goods, services, capital and human resources,"" he said, adding that bilateral trade has grown 17 per cent in the past one year.

""We look forward to engaging with Portugal in the Atlantic International Research Centre, both in the Space and Ocean Science fields,"" Modi added.

Other MoUs signed:

Protocol amending the Double Taxation Aviodance Agreement

MoU on Nano Technology MoU on Public Administration and Governance Reforms

MoU on Cultural Cooperation

MoU on Youth and Sports

MoU between Portugal India Business Hub and Indian Chamber of Commerce

MoU on Cooperation in the fields of Higher Education and Scientific Research

KOLKATA: A 14-year-old has wowed cityscientistswith her discovery of the impact of the 'Om' sound in reducing fatigue.Anwesha Roy Chowdhury, a Class-IX student ofAdamas World School, topped the recently heldScience Congressorganized by the state government.



Her findings that chanting of 'Om' increases oxygen level in blood and lowers carbon dioxide and lactic acid, which reduces the level of fatigue, were vetted by physics and physiology professors of Calcutta University andJadavpur University. Debashish Bandopadhyay, head of the department of physiology, Calcutta University, told TOI, ""Anwesha's project is innovative, it's quite flawless and convincing.""



An-we-sha, who likes to spell her name thus, since anweshan in Bengal means 'search', told TOI, ""I found that sounds with a particular frequency, if heard or recited right, raises the level of neurotransmitters and hormones like serotonin, dopamine, DHEA etc. Because of their vasodilatory actions, the oxygen level in blood soars. It also produces less lactic acid and allows the person to act without fatigue.""



""In the last decade, the body of research on workout music has swelled considerably, helping psychologists refine their ideas about why exercise and music are such an effective pairing. But this specific finding on the 'Om' sound is impressive,"" said Rina Venkataraman, secretary, state science and technology department.



""No one has ever pin-pointed on the 'Om' sound and conducted such comprehensive experiments on its use,"" Dipankar Das, senior scientist, state science and technology department, said during a workshop conducted on 165 students who were shortlisted for the statewide Science Congress recently.



It all began when Anwesha visited Uttarakhand, where she ""found some priests carrying water from Bageshwar to Kedarnath, covering 68km every day, without tiring. The priests sang a tune all along. There was no way she could reproduce the same mantra for her experiments. So Anwesha started looking for a similar tune.



""Finally, a tune with 430+ Hz frequency clicked. In five experiments in various laboratories, I measured the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels of 17 adults (all on the staff of BITM) while listening to the tune for 30 minutes, and there was an increase of oxygen level and decrease in carbon dioxide in their bodies,"" Anwesha said.

A place to discuss scientific and engineering research for and by Indians? [Science & Technology],6,5jscfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5jscfe/a_place_to_discuss_scientific_and_engineering/,3,"I've been thinking about this for a while. It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.
 
The topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).

I am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

I would like to hear suggestions from randian researchers and non-sci/tech folk alike on this.

[NP] Need help in switching stream to Big Data Analytics/development.,9,21zxad,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/21zxad/np_need_help_in_switching_stream_to_big_data/,20,"I am looking for switching my stream to Big Data analytics. Where do I start? I would like to attend a training course (online preferred) and get certified from an organization like Cloudera in Hadoop/HBase.

My background:
- 3.5+ years of IT experience in a niche tool. Not much jobs here so I am not able to switch :(. 
- Started the coursera course 'Intro to Data Science' last year, but had to leave it halfway due to some reason.

Any help would be much appreciated!",hey_dog," Unsolicited advice - There's an ocean of difference in learning *Data Science* and learning *Data Science Technologies*. Learning Hadoop is *Learning a technology* while learning Distributed Computing/Architecture is learning a science/concept. Why am I stressed on making the distinction? Science/concepts remains but technologies change. It's easier to switch between technologies if you know the science. Vice-versa is possible but difficult.

Since you started the Intro to Data Science on Coursera; Bill Howes from University of Washington (instructor) stressed on this aspect too. Which city are you from? We have a Hyderabad Data Science group (google search for details), I think there is a similar one in Bangalore. No clue about other cities. If you can follow a degree on machine learning, data mining or statistics ( or mathematics ) you would be suited for big data analytics. To be honest, I donot have any knowledge of industry certification; most of my knowledge is from academia. 
In academia, analysis of extremely large data sets , like Facebook, has been studied for some time.  Why did you stop the class last time? And also are you currently employed? Cos Coursera is offering Data Science specialisation and it costs approx 30K. If you can spend weekly 5-6 hours for each 3 courses, you can finish this specialisation within 6-7 months. All the best!

Even I am interested in data and classes commence from April 7th. Enrolled into 3 courses as of now. Paid $150.  screw most of the advice here, so far.

Just do statistics,statistics and more statistics.  At least upto t-tests, F scores.  

Do not worry about hadoop.  Know your stats and numbers; they'll be enough AP guys to code for you in hadoop.

Maths, you either get it or you don't.

without going into details i take 'care' of this area where i used to work.  This thread needs to be relabelled: I heard there is more money in big data. I don't care about the field, just the certificate and a job to fuck up.

Does Arnab Goswami and his chums have the balls to question this? If this is not compromise, then I don't know what is. What is the point of majority if you still reward corrupt assholes.

This is why BJP supporters, the moderate centrists (swing vote), need to start being more vocal critics of poor govt. decisions. Some very questionable souls have crept into the Cabinet and people are so consumed by the Modi hype, that they don't bother to question. I am more sad than happy with this. Harshwardhan gone to other ministry, good, but which ministry : Science..now I am in doubt if he will start working on ""Indian Science"". And who has replaced him ?

> * India's Forensic Science Laboratory is in negotiations to purchase the security bypassing technology used by Israeli mobile software developer Cellebrite, the company that the FBI enlisted to help unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter earlier in the year (via The Economic Times ).The FBI needed Cellebrite's ""mobile forensics solutions"" to bypass the lock on the iPhone 5c in question, a method which Apple vehemently opposed throughout the lengthy public spat between it and the U.S. Justice Department.Cellebrite has worked with government and law enforcement agencies ""around the world,"" and the FBI's interaction with the company was reported earlier in the year to cost somewhere around $1 million.

> * The terms of India's purchasing agreement with Cellebrite were not laid out, but an anonymous official from the Forensic Science Laboratory said that the Indian government is expected to get the unlocking technology fairly soon.As the FSL official mentioned, after its purchase of Cellebrite India intends to become the ""global hub"" for cases similar to the one between Apple and the FBI that occurred this year, since it will now own the ""entire tool"" to open encrypted smartphones.

> * It's mentioned, although not in much detail, that requests the FSL receives by other institutes to unlock a smartphone ""will be entertained at a fee.

> * ""It's not clear how India's purchase will be different from anyone else's, or what would lead the country to become a ""global hub"" when others can also seek out help from Cellebrite.Despite the FBI eventually finding nothing of importance in the San Bernardino iPhone, the political and technological climate surrounding the case will continue because encryption is "" essential tradecraft "" of terrorists, according to FBI director James Comey.

We are a united and secular country in 2016 and the credit for all of it goes only to Nehruji.. He tried to maintain state control over R&D. Which resulted in mostly failure. The only Institution that succeeded was ISRO, and to a certain extent DRDO. All the other institutions became assembly plants for imported technology. Another point to note is that, early on there was more stress on humanities and literature, rather than science and technology. The focus on Science and Tech only came after Rajeev Gandhi's time.

Dr. Joseph has given a neat picture of the decaying scientific temperament of India. Coming from a leading science and technology institute in the country, I would like to add few more things on the topic. There is a Professor in my department, who, despite his excellent career record of over 20+ years, with number of publications and supervision of doctoral studies in his kitty, still remains an ""assistant professor"" due to internal politics! Extraordinarily brilliant research scholars are rotting away their lives in dingy labs even after the stipulated 5 year time frame for PhD studies, sometimes due to department policy that sets a limit to the number of PhDs that can be awarded in an academic year, but more often due to Profs not wanting to let go of the hardworking youngsters who churn out 4 to 5 technical papers every year! There are many PhD scholars who are married, have kids and dependent parents. Bureaucracy is oblivious to their struggle to make ends meet with the meagre 18000 stipend they get every month! Lack of funding and collaboration with industries cripple the situation even more. A certain Professor, when made head of division, cut off all industrial collaboration and consultancy works that used to fetch a neat income to the department on account of ""trust deficit"". Apparently he was under the impression that these collaborators may put to use the expertise gained from the institute to terrorist activities! This is the pathetic situation of Science and Technology research in India. How can research be expected to thrive in such a discouraging environment when people have plenty of lucrative career options available at home and abroad!

We are bound to cross that stage economically and culturally in couple of decades and then not only sciences, we'll have a decent scholarship in humanities too.

The Govt and businesses will support this as there will be a huge market for higher scholarship in that phase. Govt by itself has a limited role in it and is already doing a decent job. It should continue to focus on primary and secondary education. >M K Vainu Bappu was a young student... discovered a comet which was later named for him..... Was India thrilled by this?

The culture is same even in other countries, atleast in academia, though slightly exaggerated in Indian case. However, we can use a little more of collaborative work. I am talking about top tier research institutes in science(not engg.). 

>.....it was filled with uncomprehending idiots.

I use a 43 inch led tv, a ps4, a router for gaming.

i want to avoid this, so when there is a powercut, i need a ups that would give me 15 mins to shut down everything.

So what would be a good device? i am very confused between invertors and ups. dont even know the difference.

can someone point out what device to buy?

IITs and IISc elearning Courses in Engineering and Science. The technology is a little dated but the content is generally good.,24,17yxb3,http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/,6,,sig-seg-me," Oh yes, I've used these quite a few times. Some of them are excellent and there was a time when I had to learn some subjects by myself for my research and it either wasn't offered in my university or I had to pay out a ton of cash for that course. NPTEL turned out to be very useful then. They have a lot a advanced as well as fundamental courses on so many engineering topics, it's great even if you're just looking to refresh your concepts. 

That said, I have to mention that not all the professors are good teachers. Some of them put you to sleep instantly with their boring voice and others are not very fluent in English and at times I felt like pulling my hair out. I know that's true for all teachers in general but I think there should be some quality control when you're uploading stuff onto the web for everyone all over the world to see. I tried some courses from coursera the other day and the presentation and stuff in general was a whole lot better, even though there isn't a lack of people with a boring voice. But all in all, NPTEL gets an A+. Sound quality has a lot of room for improvement. I became half deaf once I was watching a video on Linked Lists and it's sound would only come out of 1 side of the headphone. I was at IIT B, and I must confess that I passed most of my exams studying from NPTEL. Most the professors at IIT, wouldn't give you notes or presentations they use in lectures  etc. So either you take stuff down from projector at the speed of the light or use NPTEL. I used the surveying lectures they were really helpful. The Linear Algebra course is pretty good. It has more content than Strang. Awesome!

It's not like a very good career choice

I'm a fresher and got placed from my college and working for around 2 months now, but wtf is people's obsession is with this field? It's not a field where you are earning a lot, or you are your own boss or even your job is respectful, even after 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa, but still you're not like rich like you can do whatever you want, you're still blind by office timing, it's not like you can take a vacation whenever you want to.

Also, one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriate, 9 hours in front of computer, and 3 hours in traffic for 5 days a week and wait for weekends to complete your sleep.
Also, if technology changes and you don't know that or do not learn the technology, your career takes a hit 
I just don't get it, the obsession behind the Computer Science field, why parents put this on their children? And how can they be proud of this? Like what are you proud of, that your child is sitting in front of computer for 9 hours, and work like a slave?",ThrowaWayIdkIffy," It might not be what interests you but all things included, it is a better job than nearly everything else out there right after graduation. In most jobs (engineering or otherwise), you have to sit in front of the computer for 9 hours and you cannot take a vacation when you want and you don't even come close to earning what a software engineer earns. It is also the one field where you can get jobs right out of college. You can say about doctors but not everyone has the memorization capacity, dedication and the amount of time and money required to be one.

The only other alternatives are having a business or working as a freelancer on a contract basis. In the first, you are your own boss and can take vacations but end up worrying about the business 24/7. Also, you need substantial capital to start one and most startups fail. The second option of freelancer is a very unstable one.

Indian parents are most concerned about job stability and finding a suitable wedding match, in both of which Software engineering takes a prime spot (unless you have an MBA of course) Hey one doubt... I became project manager but did not get the 50-60lpa.. kahan complaint karoon? I hear what you are saying. I work around technology, and the completely temporary nature of the skills, and how often you have to start all over and learn all-new skills and technology makes me really stressed. 

I want my kids to understand a bit about tech, but I don’t know that I want them to do it as a career. Assuming OP is right (and he's fucking not) Professions where earning more than 50-60 lpa is possible after 8-10 years are:

1. CA
2. Politician (not sure legally though)
3. Own business
4. Actor (at least TV show lead)
5. Doctor
6. Cricket

There maybe more, but let's look at these first. Now compare the contacts, influence, money, luck and most importantly, time required to do moderately well in any of these fields, as compared to engineering.

Hence confirmed, OP trying to be edgy. So, what is a good career choice? >It's not a field where you are earning a lot, 

Wrong. maybe you're not earning enough. Your compensation depends on your negotiation skills and your technical skills.

>you are not your own boss 

In which job you are your boss when you're fresher?

>your not job is respectful, 

Wrong. Maybe your job is not respectful, don't project your own on others

> after 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa

I don't know if people earn this much if they become PM

> you may earn 50-60 lpa but still you're not like rich like you can do whatever you want, 

Wrong, you've poor money management and investment skills.

> you're still blind by office timing

Wrong. You work for shitty company.

> it's not like you can take a vacation whenever you want to.

Wrong. You work for shitty company.

> Also, one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriate.

Wrong. That's for every job if you don't know how to take care of yourself.

>9 hours in front of computer

Wrong. 

>3 hours in traffic. 

Wrong. Not every city is bangalore. even in bangalore not everyone spends 3 hours in traffic.
> wait for weekends to complete your sleep.

Wrong, poor time management skill on your part.


> Also, if technology changes and you don't know that or do not learn the technology, 

Wrong, fundamentals always remain the same.

>your career takes a hit I just don't get it

Yes, If you weren't good at fundamentals.


> the obsession behind the Computer Science field, why parents put this on their children?

Maybe your parents did, not everyone's parents are same as yours


> And how can they be proud of this?

Ask your parents.

>that your child is sitting in front of computer for 9 hours, and work like a slave?

don't sit in front of your computer for 9 hours then. And don't work like a slave. **have some self respect** I am an engineer too got my degree from one of the best engineering college in India...I have been working hard for last 5 years now I can buy Jio net pack without asking money from Family. This is how success looks like.. Fuck that. I wish I'd made an effort in school and landed up an engineer. The 'least-resistant' path to success. If you wanna hit certain milestones in life (financial), engineering is the quickest. Engineering has provided a better platform for us middle class folks to have a secure & settled life. Which is an aspiration for most of the middle class. Because we have no scope for apprenticeship education like plumbers/electricians. These professions are looked down upon. We Indians despise those who work with their hands ( blue collar jobs). As a result only two professional lines are open. Since engineering is a cheaper degree (  4 years =5 lacs as opposed to MBBS, 1 year = 15 lacs) most students opt for it. One of the things in India is that there is a natural progression for your education. 

School --> Plus2 --> Engg./MBBS/Degree --> Masters (*if applicable*)

The number of students who try to think out of this, and the number of parents who allow their wards to think out of this is pretty few. There is also the factor of not many students getting a good mentor to get a different direction or at least get enough knowledge about the other options.

In terms of the work, as someone said below, almost every profession nowadays demands that you spend time in front of a computer. This is not applicable only if you are in the sales field, or a factory worker/supervisor or really unskilled labor. Anywhere, where you are in an educated position or even at the managerial level in a factory, you will necessarily end up spending a lot of time in front of the computer doing a lot of documentation and reporting work at least.

I think the essence is to get a job which interests and excites the mind, and in addition, try to get a good remuneration for the same, which can support yourself, your family and whoever is required along with. The demonization of Engineering and Stem studies is incredible. Engineering is hard and good jobs in India are scarce. The main problem is, not everyone can be a good Engineer. Then when people are not capable of doing good Engineering, they despise it.

Does not mean Engineering jobs are bad. Perhaps you are in a bad company or in a bad job in a good company or both. If don't have have attitude or interest or both for engineering, quit right way and do a MBA. Mba jobs require more soft skills than hard skills, so you can bull shit away even if you are not interested. The fact that you think of becoming a project manager in 8 years just as you have started your career shows you have no interest in the fun part of Engineering. So I think it is much better you train for project management with a MBA. 

But if you think Engineering is fun or you have the aptitude for it, then sky is the limit. Immigration has been never so easier and there are also great companies in India depending on your interest. If you are looking for just money you are better of selling soaps and chocolates in a FCMG.

The typical IT companies even after their worst working conditions offer much better than other industries and a good possibility to immigrate or to find a great Indian company to help find a satisfying job. 

Please stop demotivating others with such rants Lol. It's an excellent career option. But then, you need to be competent and competitive. Problem with 2 months of work ex : People with 8-10 years of work ex make 50-60 lakhs.

Unless 8 year work ex guys are coming to your office in BMWs/Audis, you’re in for another reality check soon. 50-60 lpm in 10 years...🙄 sure i will like to smoke whatever it is you are smoking 😬 This post is ignorance at its finest. Shitting on IT is the new fad amongst Millennials. Like shitting on Chetan Baghat. 

It is not a very good career choice? Wow. What else is? 

Like u/SerpantSociety told, most aspects of your questions is wrong. IT is hugely responsible for providing parity to the middle classes of semi-urban and rural India, and that is a fact. Earning 50-60 lpa whilst working a 9 hour day job sounds pretty awesome to someone who grew up in middle class mediocrity. I am sorry but our life experiences are pretty different from those with the privilege of being born in circumstances where ""money isn't important"". Engineering is a key profession for building an economy, from top to bottom. When India was looking to modernize its infrastructure and economy, they need(ed) a lot more engineers to do it. They had 2 options, bring in engineers from outside, or train a bunch locally, which they chose to do. While India has seen improvements across the board in infrastructure and economic growth, they have trained more engineers than they need and now have a bit of a glut of engineers. With how supply and demand works, the average wage of those engineers has fallen.

The US is seeing something similar in health care. As the baby boomer generation dies off, the smaller number of Gen X's aren't filling up the hospitals and assisted living facilities that where built up for the boomers. Now those facilities are starting to close and we have a glut of doctors and nurses, so the wages for both are falling. I need some help guys. I currently have 3 options to choose from which one should I go for? If I am doing Engineering from a Teir-1/2 College ? 

1- Mechanical Engineering 
2- Civil Engineering 
3- Computer Engineering 

I am not passionate about either of those but I will do anyone of them without any problem as I can work hard and get a degree easily. I just want a field which is safe for the future and guarantees a decent job with a decent salary. Which one should I prioritize first and the least? Any Advice is appreciated. 50-60lpa = some people earn that much in their entire career while doing much more strenuous physical labour.  
If you're earning that much you can in most places afford to live near your office drastically cutting down your commutation time.  
  
As for your health that depends on the individuals initiative and lifestyle.  
  
Whether you're earning 0 or crores, there's always a risk of you losing everything

  
As you said in 8-10 years you might earn 50-60lpa. If one is talented and ready to keep on learning forever there is no limit. Plus it is slightly easier to get into this field. the indian education system demands an ideal of 

(1) memory oriented teaching, studying, exam taking

(2) not *very* hard to learn, given a decent effort.

(3) no/little *actual skills*

(4) has **some** demand in the market, i.e., there is a greater chance of getting *some* kind of job with the degree than not.

(5) enables a wider variety of careers than most alternatives

(6) (minor) good for visas demanding 4 years undergrad education. (most BA/BSc etc courses are 3 years, which creates a problems for some visas)  which enables

(7) colleges can charge decent (not great) money for such courses, and the investment of setting up a college, acquiring accreditation etc is (a) reasonable (as compared to setting up a medical college say) and (b) has some kind of cash flow positive business model (though recently the glut of such colleges has killed this)

""Engineering"" (as taught in India) ticks all these boxes. And to be fair, given how the rest of the education system fares, engineering is a decent default for your typical unfocused +2  student to choose. It's an easy way to earn a decent salary. Furthermore, being a modestly successful engineer or programmer doesn't take a ton of innate talent. You might have something special if you get into a top-ranked program, but most people going into the profession are ordinary folks with a lot of pressure behind them.

There are other ways to succeed, but I think Indian parents steer their kids away from them because they're not stable, certain or surefire routes to success. The same dynamic exists in other parts of the world. Being a programmer is a better way of ensuring upwards socio-economic movement than being an anthropologist, historian or radio host. If you're from a poor background, you're probably less inclined to take risks when it comes to career choice versus passion. The same holds true if your parents come from a background, or can remember what living poor was like.

Most Indians are only recently middle-class. Even many upper-middle class people do not come from old money and likely had parents who struggled financially while raising them. So in a place as obsessed with status as India, the trend is to go after ""secure"" money in a way that preserves social standing. There is a cultural and socio-economic component mixed together. 

I know a lot of Eastern-European migrants in the United States. For them, money and status are interchangeable. So you see a lot of Russian and Tatar guys who brag about how they have basically no education but earn as much as doctors with trucking businesses and taxi companies. A lot of them are pretty miserable, though, because they only live to make money. 

Indians do the same shit, except don't see all income as equal (e.g., guy who drives a truck in the U.S. and earns 1 crore per year will be looked upon with disdain versus some programmer who makes 1.5 lpm). But Indians have that same we-were-recently-poor outlook that makes them scoff at any pursuit which isn't money-centric as worthless, even if it is fulfilling, based in passion and genuinely contributes to the well-being of the country and community. 

I know many people who studied subjects like history, sociology and and anthropology. They were all very smart people who got into good PhD programs overseas and are now earning more than the average engineer in India ever will. But that path is riskier, because an above-average sociology student still has a below-average chance of getting into a top-ranked program. Furthermore, people who go that route are basically required to get a doctorate if they ever want any shot of earning a sustainable salary. In a country where getting a job right off campus is a challenge, engineering is offering that. I am not saying that ALL engineers get placed. But its easier to get placed as an average engineer than as a  average XYZ stream person.

> It's not a field where you are earning a lot, or you are your own boss or even your job is respectful, even after 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa.

Engineers start out at 3lpa for jobs that can be automated. And they grow at a rate of 5-15% every year. For a basic skillset that is the right amount. Most of the jobs in the other fields also start out like this.

First of all, you don't make 50-60lpa in 8 years unless you started out at 25-30lpa, but if THAT is less for you, I wonder which world you're living in and what profession you imagine will pay more than this to a mass of people. Don't tell me startup or business, because they require a lot of fund to start and they're very risky. Very few startups and businesses make good money.

> but still you're not like rich like you can do whatever you want, you're still blind by office timing, it's not like you can take a vacation whenever you want to.

This holds good for most of the other fields. And you can do software engineering and get into freelancing which will give you this option. Not the case with many other fields.

> 9 hours in front of computer

That's on you. If you feel its too much, switch. Not all jobs are like this. A lot of jobs give you work from home options and flexible hours. More now than ever with the startup culture kicking in. You're expected to finish certain tasks and nobody is bothering you until the deadline. In newer companies, you're even allowed to pick what tasks you want to do from a ToDo board, set your own deadlines and work. If that's not freedom for you, idk what is.

> if technology changes and you don't know that or do not learn the technology, your career takes a hit

Literally same for every profession. If you're a CA who doesn't learn how to comply with GST, your career takes a hit. If you're a teacher who doesn't learn how to teach today's syllabus, your career takes a hit. If you're an agriculturist who doesn't employ modern methods, your career takes a hit!

But to be honest, what you read on hackernews and shit where they say technology X is dead and all is to be taken with a pinch of salt. The industry still has requirements for PHP who's funeral is performed every day by people all over the Internet. So, if someone learnt PHP in 2000s and decided not to learn anything else, doesn't mean they're jobless today. And 15-18 years is enough time for you to progress into management. So, this is also not a very valid reason. Simply because even if you are the 40th or 400th best engineer around, you would still get paid. If you are the 40th as a business in your industry, you will end up dead.

It is quite practical and that is why most Indian parents push this on their children. “In India, people decide what to do in life after they complete their engineering”.

-- Unknown One reason I think is because it's flexible , you can do whatever you want with an engineering degree , but with other degrees your options become limited. Cum-again please Behencho I'm now mad that I never knew about a job that would have gotten me 5 lakhs per month after 10 years. Hmm, too many people got butthurt from this post I guess. > 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa, 

It may be due to lies/dreams like that... kind of like chasing achhe din. As soon as I get home I will make a write up about it.  
Basically every parents think engineering jobs are easy to get and this made the  study it. Later to just realise it's a shity one and the don't have the courage to face kids.  Kids whose time they wasted.  
If you are unlucky to be born in a family who doesn't know what a engineer does and have to do, then you are fucked.   
My parents still things a electric engineering repairs bulbs and fixes wires.  

I passed from a private engineering college and working under a  PWD contractor. My parents wanted me to study and get a government civil engineering job(lol) .  
 I earn just 20k per month.  Might sound low. Let me tell you the perks.    
Work site is just Rs 20 commute from home and I get around 100 per day for travel.  I leave my home at 10 am and get home around 4 pm.  
My work being managing field and bill work.  PWD Office is 5 min walking from home.  
I have zero to no expenditure. I would like to point out that while engineering jobs give good salary as per Indian standards, but on a global level, we have one of the lowest  salary for an engineering job.


The reason for this is that companies come to India in search of cheap employees. In my own experience I have been in projects where I worked with European engineers. We did the same job, but there was a big pay gap.


Now I get that other countries have high living standards and hence the pay gap is justified. But since the qualification and job is the same, it highlights what Indian engineers can earn by entrepreneurship or freelancing!



I have followed what I have written and have been job free for 2 years now.

edit: So I would suggest to seriously consider entrepreneurship after engineering. To be frank, this does not seem like a bad option in India.  I know this is not a perfect life and maybe not what you wanted, but that""s life.  Not everyone can become a highly successful person in photography, acting, singing etc. At least with an IT Job, you have an option to pursue your passion and a relatively very less risky job, with ample opportunities in India.  It is actually one of the best options out there. It has been good career choice since 90s. Now it is on the decline but career trends take time to change. Got you . Pakoda bijness promotor ! 60lpa in 8-10 years that too in Average service IT companies like TCS, Wipro, Infosys etc is that even possible? When you start at 3.5lpa I doubt you will reach 60 in 10 years in an average Indian IT company. Mainly because professions are not redirected in india. Take example pf pharmacy, it is only here where you can get prescription drugs( not only narcs but also antibiotics) can be anywhere without any consequences. Also, if you do get to work on your dream, it is absolutely powerful. I love sci-fi and I am living it. I think it's one of the best profession (good mix of pay and work-life balance) if you are average student.

And I am sure about ""pay"" and ""work-life balance"". It's not Europe. You will be surprised how shitty working conditions tons of people have. Nothing else is as safe Where do project managers earn 50-60 lakhs. If you go by societal norms, you're a failure if you're not -

1. Engineer 
2. Doctor
3. Entrepreneur
4. Government Servant

Did i miss any? Regardless, fuck societal norms. why India so many Engineers even overseas but India infrastructure shit. poor country means more things need to built and implemented. so parents push kids to look at opportunities to build stuff. rich country you can be an english major and still make kick ass money. It's the Indian way. Doctors have such miserable workdays and compulsory deployment but it's still promoted I would want to be ""50-60 lakh not rich"" person over anything else.

I opted for science after the board exams. Realized I won't even pass, had to fight with family members to change it to Commerce and I passed with 57% marks. 

Came to Mumbai to study CA, Estimated around 2.5 lakhs as fees & Expenses.   Couldn't afford that.  I  had interest in technology so decided to pursue it instead. 

Learned computer engineering (hardware networking) for one year  and got a job at a MNC, worked in that field for 6 years. I was just 17 when Joining this Job & a Didn't complete my Graduation. 

Around 5th year in my job I realized I had more interest in building things on the internet than fixing active directory problems. 


I started learning more and more about it, and build a real blog which got decent visitors and started to make some money.  But to really make something worthwhile I had to dedicate more time.  

I used to live in Virar and traveling to Andheri (Mumbai) every day for job took 9 hrs + 4 hrs of my time and after that hectic peak hour mumbai local the body simply didn't want to work anymore.  

So in around 2013 I left my job and decided to move full time into Internet marketing. 
My wife, her parents and my Mom all thought I have gone mad and pretty stupid. And honestly That's pretty much fucked up if you ask any one of that age. 

For next 12 months I built websites around local businesses in UK , ranked them and sold the leads to two companies. The most successful of them was one was around heavy transport vehicle driving training. The company paid $35 per lead and I made more than $4K per month (around 2L in INR) with it.  

This boosted my confidence and I invested most of those funds into experimenting and investing in digital marketing. 

I used to post my screenshots on Facebook, In 2014 a random dude msged out of nowhere and asked to meet.   He looked confident and we meet at a Google conference later that Week.  

We discussed what we both has been doing. He had lots of contacts at emerging companies and I had the skills, strategies , and contacts to actually delivery successful marketing campaigns.   it was a promising match and we end up forming a company together. 

We built a digital agency, the first client he brought gave us over two crores in revenue. We quickly built a team of about 40 ninjas and went on to become a very successful company. 

In next 3 years We worked with more than a dozen listed companies, 3 fortune 500 company and made a lot of money for ourselves.  

At materialistic levels, just last year he bought a very expensive car (80 lakhs), travelled to over 30 countries and I bought  a expensive home (3BHK powai - 2.5 cr).  

We are still partners and have been doing great so far and hopefully will continue to. 

At multiple times in my career I had to fight with my own people, go against the wind to make my way.  

Point of all this is, you reddit guys are tech adopters and are technically more advanced than the general public.  There is a lot of people who are stuck at a job they hate but can't do shit about it. Either for family pressure or a dozen different reasons. 

For You, I strongly recommend that in your free time develop a skill - mostly in a area you enjoy doing , and use that skill to compliment your primary source of income. 
Once you are confident enough and have some numbers (revenue) to back it up, take a leap of faith and see where it takes.   


Don't worry about failure - If you fail, getting a job is the easiest thing to do.   

I agree that the being a  entrepreneur is volatile and there is no security but so is everything else.  Just see how many people gets fired everymonth with no where to go and they all wonder if they could make something like that. 

Parents ko bus paise chaiye. As long as they see you are making good enough,  they will be fine. Sooner or later.   My father in-law loves to flaunt when I share my photos with a BMW and mom makes dozens of calls telling all relatives whenever she purchase something expensive.  

They just want to see you happy, it's just that their scale of happiness is a bit off.  Trust them to trust you.",alertify," Thanks for sharing - somewhere there is a person that is at a cross road - who will read this and  your lessons maybe the push they need.

Your story is very inspiring, but this piece of advice is quite... indigestible 1 in a million story imo Good story. And really awesome how you never gave up!

Buuut, here's the thing, this is just one story out of millions.

A good Bo Burnham quote about this :

>I would say don't take  advice from people like me who have gotten very lucky. We're very  biased. You know, like Taylor Swift telling you to follow your dreams is  like a lottery winner telling you, 'Liquidize your assets; buy  Powerball tickets - it works!'

Edit : Not saying you got lucky but you get the gist. >For next 12 months I built websites around local businesses in UK , ranked them and sold the leads to two companies.

I did not understand this, Can someone Explain? I was fired from my job last month and currently I am actively looking for a new job. If you could give me a chance to prove my dedication, I promise you that you won't be disappointed. All I am asking for is to just try and test me. I am really eager to learn and grow. All I need is a leap of faith Good for you man. I needed to hear this story more than your willing to share it. Thank you! I know who you guys are :D

You guys rock :) Amazing writeup and congratulations on your success.But how do you convince yourself that you will eventually get that break though? There is a lot of luck assosciated with success such as yours and even a small event not going your way could deter you. It is not our wont to take such massive risks as leaving a stable job. 
You had a talent! Please be warned: ""Follow your dreams"" is not a sane advice for all. 
Not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur (and that's ok). This post has made my day. ty for sharing your story. 
I have been trying to do this for a while.  My problem is  I have no useful interests/skills. I'm trying to find one.

Wtf 2.5 lacs as Ca fees? Where?  ***Post saved successfully*** Give job Survivor bias.. Going through the same thing, traveling from virar to andheri, and yes it's really hectic...some time it takes more than 4 hours + 9 working hours. Stuck in service company for which i never thought to work, but because i fucked up my gate exam(mtech entrance exam) i have to work now. Hope the condition will get better, trying my best to learn new technologies and also preparing for mtech exam, if you have any advice for people like me who is quite young and frustrated with the current job let me know, and thank you for sharing your story, stories like these give us hope to fight back irrespective of current situation. So basically you do google adwords right? Can I pm you for some business related queries? I needed this today. Thank you for sharing 🙏🏾 Thank you for sharing this, and I know exactly what you're taking about. But sometimes, it's a lot harder than you just made it out to be.
I've been really lucky too. I worked for a bit, and realised I hated what i was doing, and after a lot of trial and error, decided to do something of my own.
I too started something with my partner, a video production house, and worked really hard at it. At first, it was just the 2 of us. Doing everything. And we worked our asses off. We did what we think its good work, gave it our all, and put in all the effort we could to give our clients the best deal possible, each and every single time. Even if it meant we made less profit.
We continued and slowly our team began to grow. 6 years later, and after a lot of struggle, we now have a team of 10.
We've done some great work, and brought our clients really good value for money. Even after putting in so much hard work, effort and our hearts and should in to it, sometimes it feels like you don't get appreciated for what you do at all. A month ago we nearly got cheated out of a very large sum of money [for us]. And all because the people we were working with had huge ego issues. We've managed to get out most of the money, but have still lost a pretty big amount.
This kind of stuff is really demoralising. Especially when you work really hard, give it your all, put in everything you've got, and do a good job.
We're trying really hard to carry on and continue doing good work, but it's so hard to stay positive sometimes. Thank you for sharing your success story and letting us know that good things definitely do happen. I'm going to keep at it. And hope for the best. Thanks a lot for this post ! This is very encouraging . This is amazing! Would love to pick your brain some time. This is a real inspiration. Thank you op Thanks for sharing this amazing story of your life ,very inspiring . +1 for making your interest your side hustle to see if it can generate revenue in the first place. Damn!

I wish to post something like this someday. Good one ☝️ What type of websites did you build around local uk businesses?

I am learning it too, but I dont have a chance to test and practise these skills Great post, thank you for sharing a slice of your journey, I love to draw and edit pictures on my phone after drawing it, I also have developed an interest in digital marketing, where do you reckon I start  ? I have been doing a job for the past 4 years which I dont quite like but gotta do something for gandhi, thank you for reading. Yup Thanks but i still can't figure out my future Inspiring and real. Belief and hustle will get people far. You have also bought the internet down to people who do not know how to use them (the example of the heavy transport driving training). The problem with most techies, myself included, is that we stay in the computer space - its fair money, but the real money is integrating with the business world. Not just money, but independence.  
  
Congrats on a well executed life and career! Great post. But how did you contact UK locals? What was the overall approach? Can you explain that in detail? How did you get the exposure? Cool story. It is good to hear success stories ! Thank you so much, man! Just today I was thinking, what I would do after I graduate? Average marks and the fucked up field of mechanical engineering won't take me anywhere, I was thinking. Reading this, gave me confidence that building skills and struggling will take me somewhere surely! What a wonderful story man kudos on your hardwork ...as I was reading this I had a thought that just pissed me off thing just how many would have said ""ahh u made it there by luck u r one lucky guy"" but u know it's not much of luck than being passionate and working hard As a startup, what problems did you face with respect to setting up a company , paying taxes etc.. Was that an easy process ? OP can i follow you on twitter ? DM your twitter id  if you like the idea This is an amazing story.I've always wanted to try new stuff but most of the time my interests were never related to my job which is why I never went ahead.

Can you elaborate on exactly what skills you learnt regarding during the period you wanted to ""building things on the internet"" since it wasn't related to hardware networking.

I also didn't understand what you actually did with ""building websites around local businesses in UK and ranking them""(excuse my ignorance)

I guess success is the mixture of developing a skill (appropriate for the times) and just putting yourself out there to find like minded people who can complement your skills to achieve business success.

Hopefully your success story continues and even though many have failed where you succeeded they can take some inspiration. This question is for everybody

What are the new skills to be learnt as of today(In any field you're aware of) which might have huge impact in future like those related to digital marketing in 2011 and 2012 by OP) Feeling good for you OP!! Hope my life has a turnaround as such one day. Till then slogging and learning it is... [deleted] Don't worry about failure - If you fail, getting a job is the easiest thing to do.

Trust me this is hard for me Thanks for sharing your story, sir :) Awesome share. Inspired to do more. Deliver more. Really motivating post will try to grab 1% of this. That is so cool! I'm a 22 year old Internet Marketer myself. I got into it during the 12th grade (just before boards) and started by building sites for people and so on but it was mostly on-off. 3 years ago I quit college to do IM fulltime and have made over $300K online since, doing E-commerce mostly. I have a lot of plans for the future and reading your story just inspires me to go harder at it. 

Good luck with your future endeavors man! To all the skeptics saying that no one talks about failure. How wrong, pickup any successful person's biography, it will be an account of their failures and how they persevered regardless. 


The biggest takeaway from OP's advice is use your free time to develop your skills and then use those skills to break the cycle.

Being an entrepreneur is not the only option. You could learn investing and find ways to generate passive income, start by reading some Warren buffet, some Anthony Robbins. You rock boss. That's the right kinda motivation. BC IIT IIM MNC =Happy life ka funda hi chutiya hai.

Seeking advice on Warangal and an educational institution,16,crlp0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/crlp0t/seeking_advice_on_warangal_and_an_educational/,12,"A coworker from Sudan told me her younger brother got admission for [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) (Civil Engg.) in *Chaitanya Institute of Technology* and Science, Warangal. She wanted to get more information.

* It looks like *Chaitanya Institute of Technology* and Science was recently established (2010) and is not ranked in any listing. Any insights?
* How safe is Warangal for someone from African continent. I have seen posts about violence against Africans on this sub-reddit.
* What are the possibilities for him to transfer to a better educational institution after he starts in one educational institution?

She will be supporting him financially from her meagre income working as a barista at our cafeteria; so practical advice would be greatly appreciated by her. Thank you.",nirjhari," It's not ranked because it's just one among many other private universities in the country. I'm not aware of how much tuition fee they're charging but, if it's comparable to other well regarded private universities in the state, I'd suggest him to try for those. There's National Institute of Technology in Warangal, which is very well known and there you could find few students coming in from African nations and other foreign countries as well, probably to spend a semester or two there.

If you don't mind me asking, how did he come to know about that institution? He could've probably applied for universities in Hyderabad or any other metro city or even second tier city like Vijayawada, which isn't that far from Warangal. Cities are much safer because you can find someone from your own country(or neighborhood nations) there, studying in some other university. Better try for universities in Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad or any other tier two city in the south.


There are many private universities which do have good facilities and offer quality education, but be careful while choosing. There are probably like only 10% good ones, from among them all. SRM, GITAM are two private universities that I know of in my region. There are probably many such in metro cities but I don't know about any of them right now. Also, he could try applying for public universities, but then it's not gonna be easy. I'm not sure of his aptitude and STEM subject skills so I can't really suggest any public ones. But be sure to check them.


Violence against people of African origin does happen, but if he stays in the metro region and avoids traveling alone to remote areas in the country, he's safe and good. Also, it's better to get connected with students who  came from your country, as they'd be very able to guide you in a better way. I could only help you in suggesting whether the university that you opted for is regionally well known or not, but culturally adjusting is far more important. It'd help if someone you know is in or around that area.


Feel free to ask questions regarding universities or anything else. Hopefully, I can answer them as well. I used to live in Warangal. Many African students studied in NITW. I know of none who studied elsewhere. It was an okay experience for them.

Interestingly, I took an auto one day and an African guy was riding along. The auto driver tried to rip him off but the guy was having none of it. My guess is that these auto drivers try to rip them off any given chance. Other than that I think it was pretty okay for them. There is that subtle racism though, like impulsive mistrust. There's a very tiny African community. If he can get in contact with them, they can advise him on safety and stuff.

CIT is not a college for a foreign national to pursue education in. If the degree has value in Sudan then I guess it's okay but other than it, it's not of much use.

I'm not sure about the possibilities of transfer. He has to discuss that with the institute. Instead of seeking advice about the educational institutions, you should be seeking advice about whether this fellow should be [coming to India at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiN0SZPXlAk). Umm. I've never heard of this college - there are simply too many engineering colleges in Telangana.

Indian Podcasts Recommendations,116,c9qqnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9qqnc/indian_podcasts_recommendations/,55,"I've seen a few posts asking for podcast recommendations, so here's a recommendation thread. This is not a comprehensive list (you can find a comprehensive list by /u/yogesh_calm [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/podcasts). While lists like that are great to have, it's hard to figure out whether a particular podcast is worth listening to. So here I have tried to include some notes about the podcast and recommend a particular episode as well. The quality of these podcasts can vary a lot, but these are some that I found were worth listening to. Anything I especially recommend has a star ★ next to it. I've also mentioned the language of the podcast. Hope you find this useful.

Helpful post Great post. I think you should make it a regular feature and rather than posting all your suggestions in one big post, make it a monthly or weekly post where you focus on 2-3 good podcasts.

I find a lot of my podcasts from your first category, and my app is filled with so many podcasts that sometimes I get stressed out that i'm not able to listen to them. Also I'm not able to do multiple stuff when listening to a podcast, any suggestions on that front? SynTalk is great too.

[Rant] I'm seriously tired of this is so called education,12,ctzkd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ctzkd1/rant_im_seriously_tired_of_this_is_so_called/,6,"This is mostly your weekly education rant, nothing new. Throwaway account since I'd like to stay anonymous and wanted to let my thoughts out in the open.

A bit about me first. I loved computers from a pretty young age but at the time I simply loved it as a hobby. I also remember the young me reading tons of books on topics like space and nature. The only thing I was good at my middle school was Physics and Computer Science but kinda ignored all the other subjects. I also loved helping other students with these subjects to the extent teachers would point out to me with ""stop being so noisy"" and ""get back to your seat"" kind of synonyms. I was pretty open to the future wondering what it held for me. Anyway, I decided to pick up Engineering.

Everything has been going in a downward spiral since then. As any typical kid in India trying to get into a good Engineering college, I went to these so called JEE coaching classes. These places were so horrible. Over time, I realised that these coaching classes are simply forcing down material onto their students. If there was some actual learning happening in there, given the vast syllabus, it wouldn't be so surprising whenever a high school kid from India marked an innovation in science. Rather we see students killing themselves for not being able to score good marks in the examination. There is such an intense pressure on kids since you're constantly being told that not making into a good college equates to no woman marrying you and you're going to be working an awful job, if not jobless. In short, your life is going to become so fucked up that we see kids already making peace with death instead. And then out there are some fucking assholes who feel that this is helping in reducing the population of our country by weeding out the unworthy. Just stop making kids at the rate you shit, fuckheads. Instead of making a positive effect in the country, these coaching centres asking for a shitload of money are simply saturating the already saturated field of Engineering in India. Some parents also force their kids to these coaching centres just because of their faculty flaunting their achievements as if they are a God's gift to this world. Anyway, these coaching centres are just a symptom of the core problem of how most reputed colleges in India accept students solely on the basis of one or two examinations and how colleges like to be seduced into being an AICTE approved college. This whole education thing has turned into fucking business.

I failed my JEE since I couldn't keep up. The failure doesn't hurt me, partially because it is my way of rejecting this system. I've come to a realisation that I cannot learn things solely by books and paper, I need to experience it in reality, or I cannot digest anything. Which is why I was probably good in and loved Physics and Computer Science. It costs virtually nothing to see things in motion and see that the equations really do match up, and write computer programs to do stuff for you and everything makes sense. The thing is that doing everything in such a way consumes a lot of time, but I feel it is worth it. It's extremely hard to work on all the high school concepts here and look out for their real world significance at the same time, all when the examinations are pretty much all formulae and rote based.

Anyway, I joined a tier-3 college hoping to at least make it nice in Computer Science since all you need is a Computer to experience anything. But oh lord fuck this place. Just so you know, I spent my high school years learning to program by writing small scripts to manipulate my environment and eventually, I started working with other people to make open-source software. So all this helped me get into GSoC in my very first year of college and worked with some genuine people working hard to make a positive impact to this world. If not for GSoC, I'd also have been forced to attend the ""summer training"" to ""learn HTML & CSS"" along with other students in the college itself, where the students are kept idle for like half the session and you know what all restrictions they put on even when you are idle - no phones, no YouTube, no heads down for taking a break, no talking to other students (seriously?!). I had another friend of mine who did GSoC in the 2nd year but you know what, students were supposed to ""attend a training institute"" by paying the institute money during this summer break but apparently his GSoC wasn't considered since it was seen as an online course (as opposed to going and attending a training institute) by our Head of Department. So, rejected. Poor guy still had to pay a private institute for his forged training certificate despite of working so hard and lie that he worked on both his training and his GSoC project.

I'll talk about some more wonders here. Our college has so called Soft Skills sessions where instead of learning how to communicate properly with other people, you are simply taught how to flaunt and bluff every little thing to everyone and speak hollow words to ""impress"" other people (since in the end, this college only cares about to headline the highest number of placements offered in the Limca Book of Records). Rather than receiving proper technical knowledge, we spend time practising aptitude questions. Many students here have difficulty communicating, structuring grammar and forming sentences in simple English due to their unfortunate backgrounds and yet no work is ever done to help those students become proficient. It's been 3 semesters since we've been studying about Software Engineering and Software Testing to learn the craft of creating and maintain a software, and literally not a single fucking line of code yet! Most students still believe all that there is to testing a software is looking for bugs by hand. There hasn't even been a mention of automated tests and sort till date and I am 3 years in. And, if the authorities find any students good in solving aptitude questions, they are going to differentiate them by making them solve CodeChef problems in extra classes as if remaining students are merely a possession to the college for the time.

We are assigned to work on a team project every semester and are evaluated by professors who have no experience in the said technology the project is based on. These professors then end up judging students by asking standardised definitions from the desired technology in the final viva instead of actually evaluating by asking project specific questions. No wonder the majority of students steal from GitHub or copy-paste projects from their peers, no one cares. Also, the assignment questions are so blunt with hardly any thinking involved, you can look them up and boom you get full marks if you submitted it on time. Now, I could keep listing whatever the hell is wrong here: Minimum attendance: 75% or no exams for you. Students are forced to stay seated and their heads up even if the concerned subject teacher is on leave and the substitute teacher has nothing to teach about. Internet/WiFi is censored by some company called FortiGuard, anyway the Internet hardly works here. Can't eat, roam or leave the campus before 12 noon. Worst of all, there are students who have been so brainwashed that they blindly trust the authorities just because they believe the faculty is truly full of professionals and are the ones who can help them get a job if they keep repeating their words. We aren't really learning anything here of actual use.

I don't even know whether this is the situation for most colleges in India or I just happen to be in one.

Now here is me who helps with some really nice open-source projects, writes technical posts trying my best not to repeat what the Internet already knows, fighting censorship, trying to help my peers and random internet people with anything technical whenever possible, just because I like to care about people.  All this when college eats up my 9+ hours (including commute) everyday, I really feel like a fucking idiot now. What am I even doing. I don't even want to bother with money or be a rich man, just enough to feed myself or if a family happens someday. This shit has been so sickening lately that I've started doubting that it's just me who the real asshole here is.",throwaway93681," I agree dude, the whole system is ass here. I went abroad for all my education even after I cracked JEE because I knew I would be able to actually grow as a person out there. College should help people mature and grow instead of just forcing an education. They don’t treat you like an adult or give you any freedoms here. I remember my first day in a dorm and I asked the RAs if there are any restrictions on what time I can be out and they were like you can go out wherever you want. If you go talk to an advisor about your interest or careers they genuinely talk about it and help you find classes, clubs, minors or even help switch your major. They treat you like an adult and let you make your own choices everywhere else. Over here it’s all about cramming information into you and getting you a shitty job. Oh man. My story is like 99% similar to yours. At least you had some group projects and stuff, all I had to go through was countless hours of theory just to pass the exams from the professor who didn’t knew shit what they were even talking about.

I just didn’t give a shit anymore, stopped eating properly stopped going out, stop exercising. Started to loose interest in everything I did even the things I used to like, programming. No wonder I dropped out of engineering. Hi Mate,
I pretty much agree with most of what you said. Although I can't help you much but I can certainly offer you some advice about Gsoc and getting a coding job on your own.Life is really long and  If you really love coding there is very little that can stop from getting a great job after you are free from the university..

Ping me if you want some advice Are you from SRM by any chance? https://youtu.be/XQ0CG-HlvD0 A very honest rant, frankly after seeing the inefficient working of colleges, it's better to enroll with a distance learning course which provides a legit degree like IGNOU. A lot cheaper, saves a lot of time for learning and you are getting your degree anyway which makes everyone eligible to sit in whatever they want.",Science/Technology,2019-08-23 00:09:58

Let's discuss these manifestos!

",rahulthewall," It is ironical that these manifestos are so optimistic and ideal and yet each Government since as far as I remember fails miserably. No doubt, improvements were made but the pacing is so slow compared to the humongous problems - both social and economical- that I feel hopeless whether I look at these parties. At this stage, I am just wishing that these Sanghis just go away. I don't want another social evil devouring this country. This brazen propaganda and shameful communalization must stop at all cost.  we have to wait years when well-being of our countryman is the first and last topic in any political debate. Congress:

>Congress promises to pass the Constitution (Amendment) Bill to provide for reservation of 33 per cent of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies in the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha. 

BJP:

>Reservation for Women - BJP is committed to 33% reservation in parliament and state assemblies through a constitutional amendment.


They seem unanimous, yet the bill won't pass. Or will it? I'm a first time voter and honestly this is a lot to take in. I can't decide whom to vote for. So, how do I go about doing a SWOT analysis, so to speak, that might help me take an informed and unbiased decision as to who deserves my vote? I really don't want to hit the NOTA , I'd rather sit at home then.  
Edit : I'll read both manifestos properly and use my own faculty of reasoning and common sense to decide. Thanks for the input folks! Thank you for this quality post. I really like this apprenticeship point. Training of work force is seriously lacking in India, especially the trades like plumbers, electricians etc. [removed] Looks like the sangh got spooked by the congress manifesto, and the response was to hurriedly put a lot of big numbers together. 25 lakh crore investment for agriculture and 100 lakh crore in infrastrcture in 5 years, just to name two big items on the list.

This might be ok if not for the irony of the sangh asking congress where the money for their schemes will come from. Manifestos of other parties --

I know the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the DMK released their manifestos, but can't find anything on their website. No mention of any manifesto on Aam Aadmi Party, Janata Dal (Secular), YSR Congress, Shiv Sena or Bahujan Samaj Party websites. When no one implements what is written, what’s the point in discussing. How many past governments have fulfilled at least 70% of their manifesto? Am I being dumb or is there something to worry about Simultaneous Elections? Mods can we have this thread stickied? Maybe include discussions of manifestos of other major parties too?

And thanks OP. [deleted] To those of you saying 33% reservation in parliament will lead to proxy women being installed on behalf of their make counterparts: this was the same argument given when panchayats were mandated to reserve one seat out of five for women. This myth has been debunked. Only in a marginal percentage do women act as proxies, otherwise they're always rational autonomous agents (as much as allowed by the party whip). This is a fantastic bill and extremely necessary for all the underrepresented women of our country. Can Anyone please explain what is ""Combating Left Wing Extremism"" in the BJP manifesto is ?
Also why it didn't say much/anything about Right wing Extremism when we have seen visible growth in past couple years ? Amit Shah ki shakal dekh ke toh bilkul mann nahi hua manifesto padhne ka What’s uniform civil code again?

BJP manifesto > * Arts -  **Congress will guarantee artistic freedom**. Artists and craftsmen will enjoy the freedom to express their views in any form without fear of censorship or retribution.

>* Laws -  Omit Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and **make ‘defamation’ a civil offence**;

NICE!

> * Gender Justice - We will amend the Service Rules to reserve for women **33 per cent of appointments to posts  in the Central Government.**

> * Reservation - Congress promises to amend the Constitution to provide for **reservation in promotion posts for SCs, STs and OBCs.**

Oh. Fuck.

I don't know what to do :( Congress manifesto says it will make the supreme court into a constitutional court, but doesn't the supreme court use the constitution already for its verdicts? Here I can see most of the people are appreciative of the Congress Manifesto as being socially progressive. Never would have imagined something like this 5 years back. 

But many have shown their concern regarding the funding of the NYAY scheme. I want this scheme to work. I just hope Congress gets the funds by taxing the HNIs, like what is being proposed by AOC in the US - **70% Tax on the 10 millionth dollar**. I don't know if Congress govt can pull this off. > Instututions - Congress promises to amend the Anti-Defection Law to provide for instant disqualification of a Member of Parliament or a Member of the State Legislature for proven disobedience to the party’s whip...

No. You can disqualify them for changing sides because that is not what I vote them in for. But you cannot disqualify them for disobeying party orders. That kills democracy.

I vote for my candidate. He acts on my behalf. I do *not* vote for a party slave. It is in my benefit that he can disobey his party. This is the only outlet of a politicians integrity today.

Remove this and we become a farce > * Digital Rights - Pass a law to protect the personal data of all  persons and uphold the **right to privacy;**

Personal Data Protection Bill? I noticed most points in INC's manifesto are measurable goals where BJPs is mostly non-measurable statements... I care mostly about their economic goals. It feels weird when the Congress has more tangible pro-business policies than the BJP. They should’ve included more details around stimulating the economy. Off topic but couldn't the BJP find a better picture for this page? I cannot stop laughing.. [Here, take this pearl of wisdom.](https://i.imgur.com/Beq0IQc.jpg) > Citizenship Amendment Bill - Hindus, Jains, Buddhist and Sikhs escaping persecution from India's neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India.

rohingya muslims have left the chat I have never seen a more whataboutery manifesto than that BJP manifesto I'll gild anyone who does a post of BJP's 2014 Manifesto and list the things they delivered/ did not deliver. BJP's manifesto:
Hindus, Jain's, Buddhists and Sikhs will be given citizenship wtf. Does anyone see major Indian religions missing from this list? Whats with bjps obsession with year 2022?  Can we forget about the manifesto for a second? Went to buy some cement today and was told each bag is 45 rupees more expensive. The shakha daftars of BJP are pocketing that 45 rupees. Can we talk for a second about that? Both the manifestos are a very good reflection of the ideologies of each party. 

BJP remains true to its Hindutva roots. It reiterates a Hindu centric government where:

* Persecuted Indic faiths from neighbouring countries become eligible for citizenship. No such concession given to persecuted Muslims in Burma or Christians/Ahmediyyas in Pakistan. 
* Focus on extermination of left-wing terror. No mention of caste or religious violence that is regularly fanned by sangh outfits. 
* Promising the construction of Ram Mandir.
* Promoting measures to combat the entry of women in Sabarimala.

I can't ideologically agree with amending the constitution to give certain religions a preference when it comes to Indian citizenship. That's not what India is supposed to be. Also, while their stance of abolishing triple talaaq and nikah halala is commendable, their stance on Sabarimala indicates that they are not interested in giving equal rights to women. They are only interested in reforming Islam because it does not anger their core vote base. Regressive practices in both religions should be called out equally.

Congress' manifesto on the other hand champions social justice.

* Abolishing offences of sedition and criminal defamation. 
* Promising no censorship for artists.
* Right to Privacy.
* Increased spending on health and education. 
* Appointing a diversity commission.

It takes social justice to extreme (in my opinion) levels by promising:

* Reservations in promotion.
* Reservations in central government jobs of 33% to women.

Another disturbing factor is the strengthening of the anti-defection law. That, for me, is contrary to the spirit of parliamentary democracy. 

Judging from the manifestos, I believe this will be a watershed election for India. It is time for us to decide whether the identity of India is Hindu or are we a syncretic mix of different religious traditions where diversity is not only respected but celebrated. 
 So far it seems that Congress’s manifesto promises more liberty, freedom and expression, increased institutional accountability, more nuanced defence and internal security policy and some radical economic ideas as well. 
Whereas BJP is parroting the same thing they promised in 2014 or since then with the peculiar target of 2022.
Congress has won this manifesto game (if there is one) by rather giving and presenting a vision, which they have been utterly lacking in these last few years, than targeting BJP with a negative campaign like a threat to country, constitution and institutions which may backfire and not resonate with the larger population that still cares for food, water and jobs. In my opinion this positive campaign and presenting the electorate with something to look forward to is the best thing about the congress manifesto.  Congress has also released a 44 page document prepaered by Lt Gen DS Hooda, the architect of the the 2016 Surgical Strikes. 

National Security Strategy document by Gen Hooda. 

https://manifesto.inc.in/pdf/national_security_strategy_gen_hooda.pdf From the BJP Manifesto, page 32, point 11: 

> Women's security will be given more priority. We have constituted the Women's Security Division in the Home Ministry, and have made strict provisions for transferring the laws **in order to commit crimes against women**, in particular in a time-bound investigation and **trail** for rape. In such cases, forensic facilities and fast track courts will be expanded to bring **convicts** to justice.


* ""In order to commit crimes against women"" - slight Freudian slip there. 
* ""Trail"" - I mean, the road to justice is long in India, but that long?
* ""bringing convicts to justice"" - if they are convicts already, why are you trying them again? Or is guilt supposed to be assumed in these cases? 

Such attention to detail. Aur karo vote for development. 
 Came here to see Mandir lollipop. Was not disappointed. I'd rather drink the Kool Aid at Jim Jones's convention than believe in the BJP manifesto. all of their promises are empty. The only thing they will follow through on is the Ram Mandir temple to pander to their base of ""shit for brains"" Hindu nationalists. 

&#x200B;

Also. nothing on pollution or the environment after they caused the degradation of the environment and made China look like Switzerland. whats wrong with neet examination? Congress's manifesto looks more mature, actionable.

BJP's counterpart reads like rhetoric Given BJP republished the 2014 manifesto, does anyone else see this also acts as a report card for the BJP? BJP seems to have forgotten about the Smart City which is unfortunate. I am surprised by such a civil discussion on politics. We are seeing such a mix of varying ideas. You should see the  r/pol which is political discussion of US. Its a shitshow circlejerk  out there. I think the BJP’s promise of building a warehouse network across the country is an immediate requirement - whether they deliver is an entire different story. Basically BJP is we couldn't finish it in 2019, so by 2022 we'll do it (Their deadline were that from the start maybe to claim it even if they didn't do work). Nothing new to see here.

Congress gives lots of spending goal but not how they will get money, BJP is more like we'll build infra structure but too much infra with no use could lead to bankruptcy like China is doing to other countries.

Many positive things in congress manifesto can be extremely bad e.g. aprenticeship instead of hiring a guy, make him work as aprentice (my brother worked for 3 years as a ""trainee"") low pay and firiable without much problems as they technically wouldn't be considered employee. And how can you force private to do anything and pay for it? How will you enforce it? Courts might strike it down.

Fill jobs: How are there qualified people available? If not how will you fill it? Saw the news article of not enough jobs with 9-12 pics of people with their name, year and degree written on the blackboard behind them. 4 had their degree spelling wrong and 3 were Masters or PhD. I'd rather not hire them in jobs (they had access to internet and everything. I'd rather have a doubtful average guy than a bold stupid guy e.g. Trump)

Application fee waived: Nice but not too costly anyways. People will fill form and not go. Maybe give them a fine if they don't attend as paper is wasted.

Make India manufacturing hub: How? Maybe next points

Make for the world: I see what you did there. Nice idea but I don't think people set up shop in India as we have low tax, our main + is cheap labor, maybe focus more on ITI and skilled labor, give them stipend? And we are reducing our revenue, maybe they'll increase it in other points.

Patent acquisition: DO NOT DO THIS. I don't want government to subsidize industries and which patent would they buy? For small(definitely) to medium(maybe) industries don't follow much of norms and have lot of lee way. No one is going to ask did you pay royalties for the patent? Unless the patent owning company or individual is going around and doing round of small industries in India no one would be the wiser (most of India runs on pirated software and duplicate of original products) don't waste money.

Independent mayor: Really you want more elections and make it confusing people to vote? What will happen if there is an impasse. Blame game and stuff along with partisan politics. From personal experience, grassroots have always been to work for people and you can't BS them. With this it is definitely going to occur.

Urban poor: I guess BPL is poor, protection from arbitrary eviction. You mean if they are living illegally? Won't that be rewarding illegal behavior? If its for legal housing, isn't it already illegal to remove someone from their own home? Shelters are a great idea, include Domestic violence victims as well for shelters. Right to housing isn't this Pradhan mantri avas yojna?

Agriculture law: NO Idea won't comment but I guess it is good.

NYAY yojna: Is it gauranteed 72000 or top up to 72000(you earn 50000, we add 22000)? What stops a poor person from depositing money and just say I lost a job? CASH transfer into a bank A/C of women of the family decide is it cash or account transfer. People can take cash out of bank accounts so terminology I guess. Maybe link this to adhar and make it like food stamps in USA?

GST 2.0: So bread and cigarett, cycle and mercedes will have same tax %? Bad idea.

Bank agglomoration: Actually happening right now many banks are merging. I'm not sure a good idea or bad but its already happening. Job losses possible or no new vacancy for long time with the current process, same in future if they wanna agglomorate more.

Science: Generally government in US produces a white paper every 10 years with experts in field with industrial giants on where the future is and funds are given to them. We need something of this sort. Include academics with industries.

Fisheries: Nice, depends on who is there and how it works however it will be in clash with waterways and road development as EPA is the same.

Internal security: How is terrorism and infiltration of terrorists (not millitants) not the same, what they upgrade from militants to terrorist when they kill people? Maoist/Naxalist are different from terrorist, how? Look up definition. Communal violence or riots are generally done in large groups pretty hard to know who did it, need infra and policy to indentify groups. Also make definition clear if a hindu has fight with muslim because of a parking spot, thats not communal violence.

CAPF: Don't bring politics in army, BJP is doing it and people are giving them flack for it. Once you do some kind of reservation, other options open up and then there will be cast analysis. JUST DON'T

Arts: How will you gaurantee freedom? Employer doesn't want you to do something but you do and get fired. Censorship is prerogative of the media e.g. movies have censor board. Vigilante groups are by default illegal (look up vigilante) and can be punished.

Anti Defection law: I know this is because of Amit Shah, its fine get the law.

Adhaar: Why not expand a prevalent system instead of restricting it. Parliament makes law, so make one.

Diversity Index: Don't. How will you enforce diversity in public companies. Don't we already have reservation? What would this achieve?

State-center: I call BS. Most of the states have BJP rule, congress will flip on this law. Delhi was supposed to be a state, what happened?

Remove minimum education for local bodies. Why? Regressive move.

Judiciary: Constitutional court is wrong, look at US court, they say companies are ""people"" and money is ""speech"" under constitution. Our courts are obsolete in how judges are selected and now this? It'd make them more powerful than parliament as you need 2/3rd majority to amend constitution. Basically giving court right to make a law from a vague law.

Defamation: Not sure.

Sedition: You can shout fire in crowded theatre but you'll be held responsible for the consequences.

AFSPA: I think army does this on its court, but will all cases be considered prima facie true? Where will the cases be prosecuted where it happened or the personel home state. Will he be in jail or suspended?

Media: Ever heard of oligopoly? US has anti monopoly law and there are ways to buy pass the system. Anyways now a days due to internet and mobile phones, media is not that prevalent.

Police reforms: Special wing, nice idea.

Niti Ayog: Changing names basically or wanna have advisary committee back again?

Reservation would be BS. Like in women or SC/ST reservation on seats, they'd just have their wife run the stuff like lalu did with rabdi.

Reservation in promotion: Why? Shouldn't people be judged based on their merit? Maybe use a random person to come and evaluate.

Citizen amendment bill: No surprise here

Minorities: Its already illegal to do hate crime, what is the use of more laws? Implement current one.

Healthcare: Basically what is going on.

Education: How do you plan to increase? Wage, facilities, new schools, universities. Many institutions do not spend what they are given, maybe have administors who are not stingy enough to spend stuff and teach them its not their money but governments?

NEET: Maths guy no idea whats the problem, maybe bio guys can tell.

Environment: Great, what do you plan to do about air pollution.

High speed internet affordable price. Who is going to provide? BSNL?

Right to privacy: Definitely need it but how will you enforce it? Twitter didn't come to parliament in India. Unless you get their data centers and servers in India, this is impossible.

Sorry for typos and If I'm wrong on anything, please feel free to correct me.

Didn't analyze BJP as they have copied their last one and put years at the back nothing new. Maybe will do later. I'm gonna say it. Congress' is better and more tangible, viable and stuff. BJP is rhetorical, seems last minute. Even though I don't support Congress, I am inclined to say that their manifesto is much better than BJP's. Now if they can project a capable PM candidate, someone who's not a Gandhi then I may consider voting for them. 
 Some very important and achievable things on Congress's manifesto. Specially Net Neutrality, Education and No fees for Gov't exams Congress is way forward.bjp still sticking to its old agenda.nothing was done for the past four years. Congress tightening the Anti-Defection law sounds like them trying to save their asses after they have seen so many people switch sides and leave. It is ominous and wrong. Their Agricultural policies on the other hand look promising and much more planned than BJP's.

Can someone explain to me why do they want to abolish Niti Aayog? Communal corrupt jumla v/s corrupt jumla 

I'll take plain corrupt over communal corrupt any day. In my opinion more assertion should be given on education reforms, promoting research and improving quality of higher education. To some extent Congress has thought over it but these points are not given much importance in BJPs manifesto. I like some points from BJP and some from Congress. Am I a centrist now? Whoa.  See the order points listed by BJP - the top ones are just about their core crooked values - the provocative topics which they always use to trigger religious fanaticism. I'm concerned how Congress is going to secure funds for NYAY and education spending bump. One of the articles in Quint did the math for 3L crore needed, it is viable only if existing subsidies like fertilizers, free power,Mengra etc gets stopped. After that also, we would need 1.3 L crore more, but congress said they will not be stopping any existing subsidies. If they stop other subsidies, then NYAY seems possible. If they come to power, they have to atleast give this to some families which after leakages due to corruption will not provide any benefits , full scale implementation is not possible. Their other plans looks good especially on the security plans.  \> **Citizenship Amendment Bill** \- Hindus, Jains, Buddhist and Sikhs escaping persecution from India's neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India.

&#x200B;

I dont get this!! Why based on religion? And in the same manifesto there is talk about uniform civil code What is the manifesto implementation rate? Did the BJP promise demonetisation in the last election?

These documents seem far removed from what governments actually do when in power. 

Ideally, we would vote based on a bullshit ratio of each government, some ratio of arbritrary words said to deeds implemented.

Congress/BJP are both capable of promising you the moon and then delivering you 1.3 billion 56"" spiked dildos to be mandatorily shoved up our 1.3 billion assholes. > * Education - We will take measures to dispense with the NEET examination.

Why? never ending topic >BJP's Menifesto for Muslim women: Ensuring equal rights - We will legislate a bill to prohibit and eliminate practices such as Triple Talaq and Nikah Halala.

Meanwhile BJP's members:

""When I ripped out foetus of a pregnant Muslim woman and put it on the tip of a sword,I felt like maharana pratap""

""Rally in support of rapist and murderers of 8 year old Asifa""

""Dead bodies of Muslim women should be dug out and raped""

""Gangrape & brutalise 5 month pregnant Bilqis Bano, left her for dead and smashes her 2yrs child head against a stone"" >Simulatenous elections - Wea re committed to the idea of simulatenous elections for Parliament, State assemblies and local bodies to reduce expenditure, ensure efficient utilisation of government resources and security forces and for effective policy planning.

Jumla party missed the opportunity to shoot real commitment to this item on the manifesto by refusing to conduct simultaneous elections in j&k. Sign of broken promises to come, in case anyone wonders about those after the 10 crore jobs they promised in the last manifesto turned out to be negative. >for withdrawing allegiance to the party or for supporting another party.

I don't know much about politics so i might be dead wrong but isn't this a ""you cant leave mahagadbandhan or there will be legal consequences"" law? LMAO

Combating Left Wing Extremism - We are committed to taking necessary and effective steps against left wing extremism to eliminate this menance in the next five years. interesting one. thanks for the effort.  

question: why didn't congress do these many things in their previous 10yrs of government?    

observation: there's a lot of freebies promises from both the sides. any word on how they plan to meet these extra expenditures? is it going to be the taxpaying middle class that'll bear the burden yet again ? [removed] Is it too much to ask. For alternate terms for each of them. Both have some good and some not so good points.
The real deal lies in the execution which neither of them would be able to do without a full majority without any alliances. Acche din again? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Congress manifesto talks of filling up all government jobs!

Isnt that worrying? Many government institutions are bloated as is. What is needed is to trim them and make them more efficient. >Application fees for government examinations and government posts will be abolished.

Why??

This is totally wrong. People will fill the form just for fun. Cost will rise exponentially for conducting exams. There is already lack of resources for online exams and f every tom, dick and harry fills the vaccancies I don't how that would work out. 

General/OBC candidates students have to pay a higher amount than SC/ST, it should be bought to same level instead. Am I the only one who read 'Sankalp Patra' as 'Sambit Patra' lmao ?????????? What is the percentage of female candidates in both Congress and BJP? Reservation for women is not priority for them it seems None of the party manifestos address the need for a revision of central investigation unit which functions purely on law and investigates government institutions without fear of reprisals. Also the need for an increase in the number of judges and installation of special courtrooms for smaller offences like drunk driving and small level thefts. Increasing reservation will only create more unequality, this will marginalize the working male class. BJP's manifestos deals with the idea of increasing free market and encourages businesses which will boost our economy and create jobs. NYAY is one of the stupidest ideas of Congress so far. They want to assign such a huge amount of money to people who are basically doing NOTHING. Instead of empowering them, Congress is working towards making them complacent towards their status as poor. This sends such a terrible message and example throughout the  country that its ok to not do anything, government will take care of everything. Well communists of the whole world thought that and look what happened to them, they have 100 million dead bodies to show that this idea doesn't work. Bjp has that stupid part about Ram Mandir again which is never going to happen, not unless we violate the constitutional ammendments. None of the party has anything regarding reforming education in India and promoting research and development. Overall the Congress manifesto is more lucretive though many points are almost impossible to achieve and some are downright nonsense. Bjp has a small manifesto but some clear stupid alt right leaning goals but India will profit more from their visions than Congress. Then again when have either of these parties done what was written in their manifestos. Once again, both the parties have made impressive manifestos. Even if they deliver on 1/3 of the promises made, India will be in a better place than it is today. The first thing before deciding whom to vote should be, to get to know who are the candidates. That individual is gonna promise the basic needs for your constituency and if not then please just don't send a puppet to the assembly, whom you can't find when you need him in your constituency.
Then comes the part where you think of a larger perspective i.e which party, for the power. That totally depends on the analysis that you do by yourself. Just see around what's happening and not just by following the puppet media.
I'm a first time voter and still waiting to know who all are gonna run from my constituency because the present one whenever comes to ground ends on participating in open mic. *sings song for us* You here didn't understand my point, what's NYAY scheme is and what the construction of statues are.
Construction which will never repay us that we know very well if we check the stats.
Now what I'm trying to tell you is this from an article published on:- https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/view-india-can-actually-benefit-from-nyay-but-conditions-apply/articleshow/68822001.cms

If 50 million families were to directly benefit, NYAY could cost $52 billion, or 2% of GDP (while currently existing consumer subsidy schemes are 3% of GDP).
Carefully just read the last line in brackets. I guess now you'll understand that actually this NYAY or UBI type module works in big countries, so we can also with help of great economist of the proud country work on scheme like this.
Also if you find time just try to go through BJP manifestos and then go to Congress you'll understand what clearly is vision and what are vague promises.

Happy that you actually send me the family survey. Kudos👍 is there a way to summarize this whole discussion? Could anyone tell me how much of the 2014 manifesto they accomplished? Is it worth believing in BJP at all? After seeing these 5 years I just feel despair to know that many of my class mates think BJP is actually good (Not saying Congress is good.) 
I really wish they change NOTA to actually mean something someday. So how much faith can I actually put in their manifestos? How much of the claims are actually delivered? How much can I expect? 'Left-wing extremism™' comprises of:

1. Opposition parties that ask questions of the ruling party 



2. Journalists exercising their professional and moral duty of reporting 'facts'



3. Writers and activists exercising their rights to speak their minds 



4. And basically anybody saying anything even *remotely* critical of the Supreme leader and his fascist, terroristic Hindutva ideology
 This is a high quality and much needed post. This should be here till the elections are ongoing. 

What the hell is wrong with BJP? Their manifesto is a precursor to India's bleak future. 

Someone please spread the word that there is more to this world than communal violence and divide. there goes the chance that i vote for congress.

&#x200B;

bjp it is! Congress's manifesto is thousand times better than BJP's one.

Congress's manifesto is pro-democracy while BJP is straight out want to end democracy, Simultaneous election is the biggest proof of it.

 I want a lot of what Congress is promising but I know it's not all gonna happen. Hell, I'd be surprised if they efficiently deliver on 5% of the promised stuff. The only thing I don't agree with on Congress' manifesto is  reservation in promotion posts for SCs, STs and OBCs. Just no. That was not what was decided post-independence. Quotas and reservations were meant to continue for a short term to bring the SC, ST, OBCs upto speed. All reservations must be removed with immediate effect so everyone gets a fair chance. The general category has been languishing as far as jobs are concerned, for decades now.

Speaking of which, one important thing to note is that no party's manifesto has openly promised creating jobs for people. That's the most important issue right now, at least for lakhs of youngsters across the country. Disappointed that neither of them didn't even bother to mention it. BJP still has to depend on Ram Mandir for votes. India comprises diverse cultures and traditions. It's a composite of religions and tribes. It's not easy to bring a uniform civil code for all. BJP is just using them as a tool to win votes. 
 Repealing Article 370 is not the solution to Kashmir issue. It should be dealt through integrating Kashmiris with the mainstream Indian culture. Sure it takes time. Mere military measures will further worsen the situation. 
BJP feeds on Hindu emotions and exploit them. Personally, I find that goals of the BJP manifesto are more attainable than that of the congress. Congress's goals to be implemented (keeping aside the rampant corruption that it displayed in the UPA regime) require a serious change in fiscal policies leading to unwarranted increases in tax liabilities across the middle income earners. My professional background as CA, LLB sees a point scored by the BJP strictly from the attainability standpoint. Sometimes, less is more.

Coming to the target audience, it's very clear what both parties are looking for. Like a broken record, BJP focuses on the ""right wing"" Hindu votes while congress prefers its ""minority"" vote bank (the Gandhi's literally appealed to the Muslim community to ask them not to vote for BJP).

So far my take is that BJP has an edge over the congress. I cannot  take congress seriously when  once again they are propping up the idiot  Rahul and now even his sister has joined in,they should realize that Gandhi family has screwed over the majority of  people in India  (multiple times) too,many of them will vote for BJP even though they know they are not right for the country. I feel the Congress manifesto to be a lollipop.

They want to give ₹72,000 to each poor person every year, the burden of this would be on the tax payer. 

Also, they had 60 years to fullfill their promises, why have they waited so long? 

 Looks like BJP is serious about the Kashmir issue. If they really have the balls to abolish 370, maybe they should be given a chance. But it looks like a far cry in the light of recent statements given by Mehbooba Mufti. Jumla patra Conspicuous by its absence: Cow protection and black money! But tell me how many Governments have lived up to their manifesto?? These are cheap baits and nothing else. Idk if someone has pointed it out yet, but - 

Congress manifesto says - 

a) we'll provide RS. 72,000 / family to the bottom 20% every year

b) we'll have a single, ""moderate"" GST

There are only 2 possibilities - 

1) they'll increase income tax or bring up a new tax

2) they won't fulfill their promise

EDIT: 3) increase fuel prices

Of which, one is a well, and the others - ditch. That ram mandir thing in bjp manifesto. India is a secular country you can’t just do that . Just leave the land . It won’t effect anyone’s belief if there is one less mandir. Mandir jo banayega, vote wohi payega. Hijacking this thread to ask a question...

So... I don't have my voter's card yet, how do I apply and get it in time?

I was to get it made, but recently we shifted homes so our address proof has to be changed, so what will I show as my address proof?

Plus I have moved out of my house for my first job, living in a PG...

Kindly do suggest the best course of action, I have to vote... probably better to discuss how much work was done by both parties from previous manifesto Sab Lamba Lamba fek Raha hai. Neither will do anything and make it even worse Why aren't we getting some young whippersnappers instead of these same old ones ? Am I missing something? I don't see any point in the INC manifesto about urban mobility or mobility in general? 

Moreover, I don't think it's possible to avoid that point since it's being shown that improving public transit systems increase the economic growth of the country.

Another point, I see a few changes taking place in Bangalore with regards to this. For example, they have started to regulate and make available licences for bicycle sharing companies. They have also started building up the infrastructure, though it's taking some time. Congress states that there are vacancy for jobs then what's the problem with bjp to fill them up. Criticism over job would be over. Thanks for this. I’m actually scared to visit the sites of these parties for fear of those pesky web cookies. What a cluster fuck. The scariest and most worrisome part about this for is the anti defection law. What is manifesto.. Sorry I am just not aware Eliminating TB by 2025? Oof that's quite the promise. Just this week we studied three recent TB cases in our college. How much of what the BJP promised last time has been upheld? ""BJP Manifesto doesn't allow to copy text (even though it is a PDF document)."" 

I can copy it. Where is my ₹15 lakh promised by Modi? If note ban is so successful, from where these currency notes worth crore of rupees are coming for distribution to voters? Why the hell is the Ram Mandir in the manifesto? Can a party looking to form a government promise construction of religious stuff? Isn't that against the model code of conduct? Both the Manifestos look so *perfect* but the elected government will forget their promises within a month. I kinda see the manifestos being split across, BJP going pro-business, Congress going pro-human / society.

Wonder if   
>Digital Rights - Uphold the principle of net neutrality.  

Includes porn. Are people taking these manifestos seriously? Please just check out your local candidate and decide if they seem like people who are honest and can deliver. These manifestos are just propaganda stuff compiled by people who don't even stand for the elections. The problem is not the contents of the manifestos but whether they can deliver that. 
The past government does not have any credible track record, so it doesn't matter if they promise moon and stars. The need for minimum income guarantee scheme is and direct indication of failure of previous government at economic empowerment of people of country. The poor conditions of roads across the country is another such indication. Unavailability of uninterrupted electricity after a government being so long in power does not inspire any credibility.
I like the track record of the current government. This government has rolled out various schemes successfully. The schemes have gone through design and implementation phase pretty fast. Now I do agree that these schemes haven't reached everyone but on the other end expecting them to reach 1.2 bn people in time of mere less than 5 years is very unfair. \>Uniform Civil Code

I've regularly seen Indian media sites like Zee News and others post warnings about impending earthquakes every few months. I believe this spread of pseudoscience must be limited as it leads to unnecessary panic in the minds  of  people who don't know how earthquakes occur.

[Guide] Building your resume while in college as a CS Engineering student [Part 1 / 4],33,c87jbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c87jbg/guide_building_your_resume_while_in_college_as_a/,13,"This is a guide that I wanted to write since a long time and I was inspired by a post written about college placements on this forum. The end goal of this guide would be to land you a job at a product based company. The pre-requisites are that you should not hate coding and you need to know a programming language / at least have the determination to learn.

I will be constructing this guide as a whole for the 4 years that you will be in engineering. Feel free to skip some or add anything extra if you feel the need to. I've been writing drafts for this post since a week and have tried to organize my thoughts, but excuse any disorganization :)

This guide might help you if you check these boxes:

* A computer science student (preferably a newbie)
* Still in college (preferably in 1st year)
* Have a zeal to excel in the field and get relevant jobs.
* Have a blank resume with respect to your engineering degree.

**Stage 0 : Pre-work**

If you are very new to college, the odds are you are either severely depressed because of the achievements of people around you or you are overly enthusiastic for a new beginning or you are just unaffected by college. All of those are okay. If you are in the basket where you are scared of people boasting off about their achievement in the first year of college, don't worry! It doesn't matter what others do as long as you do what you can do and a lot of people who boast do not possess the expertise they think they posses. However, if you feel out of place, do DM me. We can have a chat.

In the pre-work phase, one has to understand their college and how things work in their college. This is best done in first year, before your first summer vacation. Most of the colleges have cells or clubs that have some sort of active projects. You need to talk to people, go through the college website and find out about these clubs. These clubs can be student-run or it can be run by a group of professors. You should be looking at the latter as they have well defined problem statements that they'd be working on and you've better chances of getting good exposure working on these projects.

Make a list of all the clubs that are there. Know about the procedure to get into each of these clubs, the projects they are offering / have previously done and who is the contact point. From these clubs, pick any of the interesting clubs/projects and set a goal to work towards developing skills that would help in those projects.

A personal recommendation would be to avoid highly specific clubs i.e. if a club is focusing on one problem statement that it is trying to solve since a few years it might not be the ideal place for a newbie to join. Smaller problem statements are good.

At the end of this stage, you must have a goal to be a part of one (or multiple) clubs during your first summer break.

**Stage 1 : Year 1**

In the first year, you will be under a common branch and your subjects will be science-related and not field-related. You might have 1 subject each semester that relates to your field, but I am not sure how much of help that would be as the teachers would be teaching the subject to non-CS people too. However, they will be introductory programming classes and its good to focus during these classes. If you don't find them helpful, read on.

We will divide the 12 months of first year into 3 quarters. 

1. Spend the first three months into learning at least one programming language. 
2. In your second three months, you should be able to read code and implement a few things. Then, pickup a programming language like C++ / Java. 
3. In your third quarter, you should look at trying to test your learning by implementing something useful. It can be small, it can be something that's already there, but do try to implement it from scratch by yourself.

Let me elaborate all three stages clearly.  


**Stage 1.1 : First Quarter, First Year - Learning a programming language**  
Python is an easy programming language to start off. You can also start off with C/C++/Java if you really want to skip a few steps, but I would ideally suggest you start off with Python. Learning resources like Hackerrank Language course, Automate The Boring Stuff e-book, some long Youtube tutorials and Learn Python The Hard Way ebook should be of help.  
Note : You should not aim to finish all 4 sources as that is not practically possible in three months. Follow a breadth first learning approach where you read a little and write a little. 

A good step to start off would be to aim to get 4 stars on Hackerrank's Python course to get a good grasp of the syntax. You should be familiar with indentation, for loops, if-else ladders, functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries and optionally, list comprehension. During your course, if you feel like something isn't clearly explained in Hackerrank, navigate to that section of Learn Python The Hard Way and refer it.

At this stage, you are comfortable with reading and writing Python, not explore Automate The Boring Stuff and try implementing some of the tasks given there. (I am looking at something that is onwards from chapter 8 of that book).

Alternatively, you can also watch and implement code from hour long Youtube tutorials that make promise to make you a hero from a zero in Python. But this looks like a hack that isn't rewarding because you are quite literally copy-typing the code that the Youtuber has written.

**Stage 1.2 : Second Quarter, First year - Implement & Learn OOP**

Many companies in the outside market look for Object Oriented Programming as a skill. After writing Python code, you are probably going to curse Java/C++ and will skip it completely because you won't believe how relevant these languages are in the market. This is one of the most common mistakes people do, but at the end they'd have to end up learning at least one of these languages. If you are taking up Java, I'd recommend [Derek Banas' Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19) on youtube. You'd be coding what he's coding, but if you understand your code that is good enough. Learn about data structures in java (List, Set, etc) and learn about Iterators, Object Oriented Design Principles (Inheritance, Interface, Extension, etc). If you are looking for something smaller, [try this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/). 

Similar courses exist for C++ also, so do your homework.

**Stage 1.3 : Third Quarter, First Year - Build something small**

So, now you know Python and to some extent Java. You've two paths from here. One is build something using Python/Java or second, learn HTML + CSS + JavaScript and build something with that. It can be something as small as a script receiving some data from an API and putting it in an excel sheet, or a calculator. The idea of this experiment is to check how fast you can build things. Once it is suitably built, you will have to write test cases. If you think it is too early to write test cases, list test cases on an Excel/Google Sheet and start testing your code for boundary cases.

For instance, if you have written a code that takes in a Reddit Thread as an input, gathers all the comments, checks the age of the accounts on all parent comments and returns some analytics (say, how many accounts are < 1 month old, less than 1 year old, etc) on it. You will need to handle test cases where your internet isn't working, the URL is wrong, you can't parse because your authentication token to Reddit API is wrong, the thread URL is wrong, etc. Basically, everything that you can think of.   


**FAQ**

> Should I get an internship in the first year?

Ideally, I wouldn't recommend an internship. Work with personal projects / college projects / skill development. Most of the internships given out to first year students are petty work that would be wasting time. Its much easier to put this in 2nd year when you will have a strong(er) resume.

> Should I specialize in one field?

No. Personally, a lot of students restrict themselves to learning only the buzzword fields, which is wrong. What is a buzzword today might have no relevance tomorrow. Focus on learning to learn, than learning one technology or one area. Initially, learn a little bit of a lot of things and slowly specialize into a field. That way, if your specialization does not click in the market, you always have a strong fundamental to pick something else up.

> Should I do problem solving?

Personally, I would say yes. But it is optional. I feel first year is too early to dive into algorithms and data structures even though a lot of colleges do teach basics of these. If you are really interested, you can definitely spend some time everyday in solving problems on Hackerrank / Leetcode / InterviewBit. But don't overdo it.

Along with the Modi wave, RSS penetration proved to be an unbeatable combination. The RSS leadership drew up a strategy that was independent of BJP’s campaign. They made a list of seats where BJP seemed on a weak footing and concentrated their energies there. Throughout the campaigning season, four wings of RSS — Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, Vidya Bharati Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Sansthan, Bhartiya Majdoor Sangh and Vishwa Hindu Parishad — remained super active at the ground level, ensuring minimum vote drift to the BJP.
 
3) **The 'Respect the Mandate' fallacy.**
If you accept that Modi leads a majority in Parliament, and can continue to be PM, you're respecting the mandate. Done. Beyond that, it's your absolute right to like or dislike, interrogate or ignore the underlying factors. Most of Indian political science is interrogating the mandates of the last 16 Lok Sabhas – what forces moved Indians to vote how they did – and in no case do scholars say, 'Our starting point is that the people made the right decision.' A mandate is not the last word. It's the opposite.

I explained that a few days earlier in a [similar comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bqhqbr/please_respect_the_mandate/eo4prbm/)

> Critique of choices doesn't mean disrespect. **The fact that you participated in a process that allows every individual to cast their vote IS ""respect"" as you gave due regard to their choices**. Now, if the choices they make lead to fascist tendencies obviously there will be criticism and you can't wash your hands off it. We are accountable for the decisions we make. The fact that Congress, after being in power for nearly half a century, could not put up a similar infrastructure, is a testament to their incompetence

TV and ads might be expensive, but call centers and data analytics are not, at least not prohibitively so. Wages are the biggest expense in a call center and one with even 1000 employees would cost 2cr/month at a generous 20k/month in salary. That should be peanuts for a party as old as Congress

The Trump campaign showed that targeted social media and data backed campaigns can be more effective than traditional media and cost substantially less. 

The truth is that the Congress has been blindsided by the technological changes in elections over the last decade. They're still fighting like its 2010 while BJP is running a much more streamlined campaign

The idea that a politician ONLY needs a good message/ideology and not a good process to deliver the message is absurd. Ssshh... you are now supposed to shut up and forget everything prior to 23 May. Bhakts will come after you otherwise. Instead cutting and  pasting from the original material and  adding ""source - Raghu Karnad"" at the end (this is like cutting and pasting a whole news article as a self submission then adding 'source ndtv' or whatever at the end), you could make your submission link directly to his twitter thread . 

Here is the twitter thread from which the above material has been cut and posted.,

https://twitter.com/rkarnad/status/1132532475136102401 As someone put it in a The Hindu article - ""Money, Media and Mafia"". Absolutely, BJP is being run by money alone. Also hate too. Thank you for this posts, I had thought about some of these points as well, just today saw a news clip from NDTV which showed how a deep-rooted WhatsApp campaign was organized in Bengal with more than 13000 shakti centers.

Almost all debates on TV and print opinions focus on opposition failure, and the need for them to have someone like Amit Shah, while forgetting all these factors like it doesn't matter at all.

And the solution? Death to congress! Rahul Gandhi go to Italy!

Edit: I was not offering my solutions to the problem, just giving examples of what people on media generally suggest as a solution , instead of speaking of unfair elections You forgot the fucking bullshit Asharam is innocent chutya brigade appearing in trending. Exactly. Elections are longer the sacred voicing of the voiceless they probably were a decade or two ago. Democracy is getting ruined by social media and firehoses of lies how capitalism got ruined by ads in the 60's. Public opinion can be played around with rather ease today given you have the bucks to pay for it.

People aren't rational, and lately but surely, the state has woken up to the fact the markets knew since long. This has always been a victory of hate. Of money. Over sanity. Also know what? Idiots of the 20 to 40 age group are the max bjp voters. Tell you what, ours (am 25, so) is a spineless generation. It has got too much love and comfort than it deserved, and being the single or at most 2nd child of most parents the urban kiddo gets too much care. Add to this the fact that the need of books is declining. Books. Yes. Books. Newspapers. People are looking for cheap sources. Also the new gen educated lad is a fucking good labour. He is docile. He doesn't want to make choices. He is timid. He has learnt some maths physics, coding, made it to some college and then some job, and continues with it. COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF EDUCATION THAT HAPPENED WITH DIVISION OF LABOUR. Questioning is banal. He doesn't question. He OBEYS. His parents tell him you will need to marry X coz X is rich/will give great dowry. Both he and X COMPLIES. Its not an educated choice. It's just that both complies with a choice in which they had no say. He reads whatsapp forwards while in office, dreams AKHANDA BHARAT, coz he is unaware of the fact that things don't work like that these days. He is unaware of UN and its conventions, he is unaware of how geopolitics work, damn, I am yet to find an educated AKHANDA BHARAT supporter that knows about BRI. Most posted on FB, india stopped paks waters. While the reality was that, india only aimed at using the excess water of Indus that it let flow through pak.  Most wrote on FB, USA is establishing democracy everywhere. When I asked them about Afghanistan, they were like, oh those INBREDS can't understand democratic ethos. Now this is one exact statement that was said to me, quote unquote. These guys never saw a war or riot. They will continue spraying shit, till shit becomes real and bites them back.

There's a reason democracy is dieing across the world. Forced Capitalism and failed Neoliberalism are two important causes. As jimmy kimmels show brought out, more than 8/10 Americans don't know where north Korea is, but believe it should be bombarded. That's propaganda for you. Propaganda comes from money. Money comes from the 0.01% . The same 0.01% globally that has realised that its heydays are running out and have started supporting authoritarian govts, a trend of neo fascism. As long as people keep infighting, its okay for them. But they know well, once the hunger cramps the empty stomach, it will seek answers, which it doesn't have. Excellent.

I’m saying there are 4 reasons for winning this election.

1) massive free man hours from the RSS volunteers. Directly credited by the party head in the victory speech - and deserving of the praise.

2) Money. Shit tons of money. The BJP has been practicing American republican style elections for at least 10 years, and the rule is simple - Every penny goes to events which increase turn out.

Keep your people motivated and afraid - they turn out. Demotivate the other team and reduce reasons to come out.



3) running an American Presidential election in a parliamentary democracy.


4) creating Modi’s narrative. Decades spent All of it is smokescreen to create monopolies for Elite families. The biggest losers in all of this will be the ground level people like farmers, laborers et al. Anyone who thinks the Congress, the oldest and longest-reigning political party in India, was lacking in media support or money is telling themselves a Big Lie.",Science/Technology,2019-05-26 20:22:55
Need some career advice or advice for future plans.,20,ccdt2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccdt2p/need_some_career_advice_or_advice_for_future_plans/,5,"Very sorry for the wall of text. I hope this subreddit is the correct place for this post.

I want some career advice but I have no friends in the relevant fields to ask. I graduated in electrical engineering and learnt absolutely nothing and have no skills to get me a job in electrical field. So I turned to IT and worked there for 1 year and god it was shit. I decided I will never get into IT and get into some product based companies. The issue is I have no education in CS. I quit last year and decided to give GATE-2019 in CS/IT paper to make my way into the computer science fields as I feel I am good at coding and stuff. I got AIR of 5300 in the GATE exam and am trying again for next year. (I'll continue with masters in whichever college I get if I don't get a good score this year too).

So now I'm completely clueless as for what my future plans are. Other than attempting GATE and doing masters. What am I supposed to do next? I feel like I don't have any practical skills to make myself employable. I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites. But I doubt that is enough to get me a job. I am thinking of learning some online courses and learn something other than C. But what should I learn? What do I have to learn to make myself employable? I understand that what I should start learning depends on which job I want to get into. But I can't decide and have no one to consult. I hear some buzzwords like data science and machine learning on the news and online but I don't know if that is right for me.

I thought of getting into the following fields: ML, Data science, Web development, Android development.

But again I have not the slightest idea of any of those. As far as I understand, ML and Data science requires more math and I can't say I'm good at math. With web development, I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding and wonder if it has good job opportunities here in India.

If you know any other good field with good opportunities in India please suggest.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I know that I have a goal. Which is to get a good coding related job. But I don't know how to get to that goal. Nor which technology I should get into. So please help me decide.",sumanthdbz," While preparing for 2020 , try to understand algorithms and data structures properly i mean give as much as you can. This is important because gate syllabus will cover basic required algorithms which is also essential for coding.

I am not a big coder but try web development it is basic requirement at least that is what i think. Many people said web development is in trend.

If you take X comapny try to prepare for it! There are resources like geeks for geeks that gives what kind of questions are asked for that company . They usually follow a trend. 

I am gonna do Mtech this year and  also just as clueless as you are. \> I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding

&#x200B;

What do you mean by traditional coding? If you think it's all just HTML & CSS, you're mistaken, Web Development over the years has grown by leaps and bounds and front-end engineering is a WHOLE thing by itself :) WebDev is a good place to start, even I really started understanding software systems & design when I started working on my first web development project - it's exciting to see a page display data they way you like it after pulling it from the database.

&#x200B;

\>  I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites.

&#x200B;

I'd say you're off to a pretty good start! Keep working on those Data Structure & Algorithms skills, you will really require them going forward! Especially in big companies, they'll ask you to solve one of those questions on a whiteboard/google doc as interviews.

&#x200B;

\> ML and Data science requires more math 

&#x200B;

You're right about this. Have you given that math a shot though? You may like it, you may not, you could check it out for yourself. A master's degree with an AI/ML specialization would be helpful if you wish to enter this field

&#x200B;

Web Development & Mobile Development have good opportunities I'd say - a lot of software engineering jobs entail familiarity with one of these. There's also DevOps which is mostly infrastructure that you could look into!

&#x200B;

For GATE prep if I'm not mistaken, the focus is on knowing C in and out, right? Like what will print(""%.02f"", 22/7) output as etc? (I maybe wrong) Then focus on doing well in these type of questions and the hackerrank type questions can wait till you're in a good college and prepping for jobs at big/good IT companies (like VMWare, Amazon, Microsoft, etc) [deleted] Are you from a Tier-1 college? If not it's going to be very difficult to get an interview in one of the large product based companies even if you get reasonably good (1700-1900 rating on Codeforces) at competitive programming. Despite being from Elect. Engg. securing 5300 rank in GATE is a good feat. You are already ahead of a significant section of GATE takers. So prepare hard this time and you'll definitely get into a great college. Once this happens, you can devote some time for properly learning AI/ML and other stuff and also guarantee yourself a good job. Since you studied Electrical Engineering and you are interested in software, Why not Embedded software? I think there are Universities that offer Embedded systems on a Mtech level.  I can recommend some courses on Coursera/edx on Embedded systems/ operating systems. I would recommend not to get into these buzzwords early in your career. If you are looking for a long technical career, get your basics right. As the other commenter suggested data structures/ algos. I would suggest operating systems/ Basics of databases/ Networking. Explore as much as possible during your Mtech.  Frankly the place you study matters only for your first job. But having a master's in ""any"" University compared to just having a Bachelor's can help you immensely especially getting a higher starting grade when you start.",Science/Technology,2019-07-13 01:23:58
[PSA] A Guide to Jobs in the field of Computer Science for Engineering Students in pre-final / final year,280,bggn06,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bggn06/psa_a_guide_to_jobs_in_the_field_of_computer/,52,"  

**Statutory Warning: I work with a lot of students in the final and pre-final year of engineering and all of the interview experiences I’ve gathered is from their personal experience. While making this thread, I have consulted multiple people who work for product based, service based and start-up companies to know about their work experience and pay scale. I’ve also used LinkedIn salary and Glassdoor Salary / reviews to support my words. I am willing to modify anything if you think it is wrong!**

I see a lot of threads every week asking about the job scene in India and how to get in. I will try to put everything I know in this post. 

**Companies** 

I classify companies into 3 types

1. Product Based
2. Service Based
3. Startups

# Product Based Companies

**What are they?**

These are companies that make their own products and sell software or integration or both. Most of the “apps” that you see are examples of product based companies. Generally, it is believed that a product based company is what an engineer should aim to get into because you will be working on making a product than using the product in most cases. You will be directly involved in developing or testing a product that your company made and the chances to be exposed to the best technologies is greater

**What do they need?**

Usually in a product based firm, the training is on the job. Nobody is going to hold your hand and tell you what to do. The training will be a bunch of online videos or MOOC or just documentation(s) that you are supposed to read and figure out what you have to do. Since the job profile is going to be like this, they expect someone who can code. You should have a strong hold in at least one programming language and some companies also demand good Object-Oriented Programming skills.

**Selection Process**

Most of the good companies hire from campuses of good colleges. There will be an online platform (like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)) where you are given 2 to 3 questions. The first question is going to be an easy question to test if you can write code. The 2nd and 3rd question will aim to test your CS concepts mainly Algorithms. The 2nd question will be of medium difficulty and will usually have a brute force way to solve and an optimized way. Coding a brute force method will get you half the marks as the complex test cases will timeout. The 3rd question is usually meant to test your knowledge of implementing algorithms and problem-solving skills.

Some companies (like Uber, CodeNation, etc) hire from platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) and do not really look at what college you come from. But there is always a clause of minimum 60% academic score in most of the product based companies. Some companies take this a stretch further and even have a cut-off on 10th and 12th marks.

Linkedin jobs and Glassdoor jobs are also a good place to look out, but the response from these portals are a little slow in India!

**Interview Experience**

Once you clear the coding round, you will be shortlisted for an interview. In an interview, you will be given a problem. The problem can be a CS problem (algorithms and Data Structures) or a design problem. You are given time to think about it and they don’t usually expect you to code out a solution on the computer. You can write pseudo code and you can and MUST always share your thinking.

Some interviewers are going to give you a vague question and expect you to ask questions for more clarity. No question is a stupid question. Each interview lasts anywhere between 10 minutes to 40 minutes. Nobody is expecting a complete, correct and verifiable solution, but you cannot give totally wrong solutions.

You might be additionally quizzed on your resume. They might ask you in-depth questions about every project you have written there and ask you to justify the need for that project, why you chose the technologies, what did you learn, what were the difficulties you faced, etc. Sometimes, they might even ask you some questions related to the technologies you have mentioned on your resume.

You might have anywhere between 1 to 6 such rounds after which you will have a HR round.

Some companies use these rounds to filter candidates (i.e. only a certain number of candidates go from one round to the other) and the other companies give you a score every round and decide at the end. So, stay calm and don’t be overconfident just because you’re clearing rounds.

**How do I prepare for this?**

If you’re in college, focus in class. Subjects like Algorithms and Data Structures are qualifiers to get an interview. Once inside, you will be quizzed on Algorithms (80-85%) and the remaining 15-20% you will be asked about DBMS & Computer Networks (depending on companies)

If you did not focus on these subjects, get onto platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) / [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)/ [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/) and start solving. If you can solve a significant chunk of questions here, start solving questions from [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)/ [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) / /r/dailyprogrammer. You can also take MIT's course on Design and Analysis of Algorithm [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/). Some of the favorite questions are about Dynamic Programming, Trees, Hashing and Graphs.

**Salary & Benefits**

You can’t put a cap on salary on a product based firm. You can get anywhere between 6LPA to 12LPA (or more) as a base salary. It depends on companies. Check GlassDoor for reviews, know what the company does and see if your interests align with the company’s interest. Have a look at their official websites, know about their products and research before you go attend an interview. 

# Service Based Companies

**What are they?**

They’re companies that use the products that are available in the market and provide a service to a client. Some service based companies have developed their own products also, but most of the money in such companies comes from providing a service to a customer. Ex : Cognizant, TCS, etc

**What do they need?**

These companies are looking for someone who can wear multiple hats. When you are interviewing (as a fresher) to a service based companies, you will likely be hired under an umbrella role of “Associate” or “Engineer”. You might get into development, testing or support. Support isn’t the kind where you have to work in a call center, but its not a primarily engineering job either. The pay is less but the role can be fun depending on how much you put into work. You will have a wide array of options to come up in your career and nobody will expect a lot from you. At least not like the product based companies! 

**Selection Process**

Call for interviews are usually through walk-in interviews or an aptitude test. You will have to search websites that carter to jobs for freshers. ([TimesJobs](https://www.timesjobs.com/), [FirstNaukri](https://www.firstnaukri.com/), etc). You should be looking for an open-for-all kind of test. TCS has their own annual hiring tests, so you will have to follow TCS to know the dates. Infosys does hiring through open-to-all aptitude tests. You can also find information on the Careers section of these companies. Some smaller companies offer walk-in interviews or are found in job fairs.

Tests like [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) also help you get interview calls. [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) tests you for basic arithmetic aptitude, English comprehension skills, logic and reasoning skills, etc. You get a score and you wait for companies to call you for interview after [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/). 

There are also “coaching” institutes that teach you basic programming and offer you a 100% job guarantee. Most of the time, these jobs are for service based companies. The coaching fees can be anywhere between 10k to 25k. 

**Do you research before you pay for any service, don’t take my word for it**

A good entry point here is reference. If you know someone working for the company, you can get a referral and get an interview. This is very much valid here and a great percentage of hiring happens through referrals also. Many service based companies leverage your attitude over your skills. Some exploit your desperation to get you in for a lower pay.

**Interview Experience**

There isn’t a standard practice for interviews in a service based company. It basically depends on your interviewer. I know people who were asked a lot of theory questions based on their field of engineering even though the company had nothing to do with that field. But I also know people who were just asked HR-round questions like “Why do you want to join this company?” and “How would you tackle X scenario?” 

So pray to your favorite God(s) and Goddess(es) before you go for an interview. Read up about interview experiences for the company on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/index.htm) and [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/interview-experiences/) to get a rough idea of the kind of questions they might ask. Don’t be nervous!

**How to prepare?**

Basic aptitude and sometimes basic coding is what these companies look for. Basic coding means you should be able to understand what for/while/if-else if-else constructs do and maybe write a code to sort an array. Refer [IndiaBix](https://indiabix.com) for aptitude and take a programming language tutorial on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com). (You’re better off with [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp) or [Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java), but if you find them difficult start with [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python). But, eventually, move to [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)/[Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java) any one). Aim at getting 3 or 4 stars on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)!

**Salary & Benefits**

Salary can be from the range of 3 lpa to 6lpa depending on your company and interview. There is a scope of coming up in the job, but there is also a scope of getting frustrated with the job. Your job MIGHT be something as simple as forwarding tickets or something complex like fixing code or managing a service fault. But, what will get you up in this field is your dedication to work and patience. It is easier to climb into management in a service based company than it is in a product based company. While it is easier, it isn’t necessarily faster. It’s a very slow process and will take some time. So, if you lack patience or if you are looking to do a specific field of work (like, development only), this job isn’t for you.

Its relatively relaxing and you are a fish in an ocean, so the expectation the upper management has from you isn’t very high! You’ve standard benefits like insurance, variable pay / bonus, cab facility, etc. But don’t expect to be pampered :P

# Startups

**What are they?**

These are usually very small, very new companies that are in the prototype stage. They’ve just got their service out in the market. They’re MOSTLY a product-based company. They’re new, they’re young, they’re not making a lot of money currently, but they promise something big in the future.

**What do they need?**

Young, talented people who work without a lot of hand-holding. It helps if you’ve worked on technologies that they are looking for. A lot of companies use open-source tech, so its not something you need to go to classes to be trained in. Obviously, you must be able to take a lot of responsibility and write good quality code as your mentor will not be looking at every line of your code.

You are given a lot of independence, but you have a lot of responsibility too!

**Selection process**

If a start-up is coming on-campus, then they’re going to go the product company way and kick in some [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) tests. There is no single way a start-up hires. Sometimes, you will be able to get in by just calling them up and asking for an internship or emailing the HR or contacting the HR on LinkedIn. In smaller companies, you can even get in touch with the founders via LinkedIn and ask for an opportunity.

A lot of the start-ups are on [AngelList](https://angel.co/) and that can be your starting point. I think it is right to add that not all start-ups are innovative. Some “start-ups” aren’t really centers of innovation, but are only for money making. Today, if you open a coaching class that will train students in technology, you can get away by calling it a start-up. So, do your research about the company. If it is a very new company and has very few people, that isn’t usually a great company to start off with, unless, you are really interested in working on the product they have.

You can also keep a look out of Internship Fairs. A lot of the HR teams attend such fairs to hire graduates / students.

**Interview Experience**

Your interview experience will mostly likely be similar to a product company interview but not as strict. There is a mixture of skill and attitude that is considered. But if you are a complete noob, don’t expect to be hired by a start-up as they can’t afford to train you fully. You need to have some experience in some field of CS. Be it data science, application development, web development or machine learning. This is to demonstrate your ability to learn independently.

**How to Prepare?**

Hands-on, Hands-on, Hands-on! Grab a field you are interested in, go about solving small problems. The problems you solve can be as small as writing a script to automatically book tickets for the latest Avengers movie or as complex as creating a robot that can extinguish fire autonomously. 

Get good or get out!

**Salary and Benefits**

The salary isn’t standard. It depends on how old the company is, how much funding they have and how many employees are there. So, you can’t put a range. It can be as low as a service based company pays, it can be higher than what a product based company pays.

The work environment will give you a lot of independence. The offices will be more employee-friendly, you will not have someone monitoring you like a watchman 24x7 and you will not have strict policies that you’ve to adhere too. Your manager and higher management will be more approachable if you ever need to discuss something.

But at the same time, there is responsibilities too. I am reiterating this because the kind of independence you get can be a bad thing if you are used to hand-holding. This is because hand-holding is done in every step of school and college in India, either by teachers, parents or peers! That might not necessarily be the case with start-ups.

I will be writing more on Skill development, freelancing, switching jobs, etc ! Stay tuned and let me know what you thought about this. :D",FanneyKhan," Good effort! Seems well researched. Nice guide. In addition to the mentioned things, product based companies ask puzzles and system design questions. Depending on the company you may be asked less about DS Algo and more about the domain in which they work. Like Adobe would ask you more about CPP and implementation of memory functions. Samsung deals more with graph questions.

Also, if you are from tier 1 college then product companies would also come for internship opportunities. The oncampus internship interviews are a little bit easy. I did a big mistakes of not studying properly in college. Now that I am graduating soon I have less than 60% and couldnt sit for placements 😞. I am willing to do whatever to  fix this problem. Please help me just guide me. Should I just join a startup or keep applying for companies ? Biggest problem is I have less then 60% 😞. The question I hate the most in interview is ""why did you choose this project / why did you choose these tools to make your project?"". Man i chose these because I wanted to! Just preference. Just focus on your skills and any good company will eventually hire you. Don't feel intimidated by the job description, if you feel like applying for that particular job go for it. Be interviewed as much as  possible you can as it will only increase your confidence. It's programmer's market out there, so market is in your favour, negotiate your salaries keeping that in mind. If you got through the interview successfully, get to know the company and their top tech Management. Ask them what's their culture like, what tools they use for communication etc. Give importance to culture and people than to salary, it will go a long way in work satisfaction and overall happiness. This is excellent. >**How to Prepare?**

Ok so this caught my eye. I'm from a college where competitive coding is preached left and right and I just can't bear it.

I've been doing mobile development for almost a year and I thoroughly enjoy it and I want to be really good at it. So my question is if I were to continue this without doing competitive programming , would I be an attractive candidate (provided by the time I graduate I have a good GitHub portfolio) to these product and startup companies? Should be a sub where posts like this are stickied. Real quality post OP. Thank you Can a graduate with no work experience but some good projects by his side get a job at a startup ? Say for example if a company wants to hire a frontend engineer. Is work experience a fixed criteria ? I've even seen college dropouts getting jobs as frontend or fullstack devs. Thank you. *flying kiss* So I have many people ask me about how base salary differs from CTC and in hand. Since, I mostly do contract work, my knowledge in this aspect is a bit limited. Can you help explain that? [deleted] Thanks a lot! Nice writeup OP. Do you have info about applying jobs in other countries? Great post OP. As someone who has worked in a startup, service companies and product companies in the field of computers over last 15 years, I can say that your post is pretty much on point. I was literally panicking about my future 5minutes ago. Thank you for providing a basic overview of what to expect it is really really helpful. As someone who is going to enter in final year this August, this post is a godsend. Till now I haven't done much except the college subjects.

I posted this question earlier in ""Weekly Coder Thread"" but didn't recieve any reply so I'm posting it again here.

Ctrl+c & Ctrl+v

Hi,
What would you guys recommend to someone who's in 6th Sem pursuing B.Tech CSE 

1. DS Algos, Competitive Programming & Quantitative Aptitude

2. Web or Mobile Development (React,Node,Django, React Native etc)

I don't have much time to focus on both points so I have to decide one.

Pls help

Even if I start learning DS Algo now(in summer vacations after 3rd year) Will I be competitive enough to get a good Company?

Angel.co is great for Startups but where can I find openings for big companies as only service based companies visits my college and mostly aren't even for software developer but some business management and shit. As someone about to complete one year as a data analyst in a reputable firm, opportunities look slim to none as my firm uses a niche software and every other company requires hands on expertise on Python and R. I have knowledge of Python and R and fairly good understanding of Computer Science but nowhere close to me contributing from day one. Can anyone help me out? There is no growth at my current job and I would love a more challenging environment where i learn and earn more than i currently do. What the average salary one can get for a IT service based jobs here, after graduating from a tier 1 college like the top 5 IITs. With low cgp (6-7) but excellent IT certificates (comptia+) and good internship experience. will it still be low as 3-6lpa? A real quality post. Appreciate it op. Is there any chance in India for college dropouts without any degree to get first job using decent github portfolio & competitive programming practice? Data Structures and Algorithms are kinda useless in testing programming skills, which is what product companies are looking for. These companies need to start developing better ways of hiring, but I guess it's easier to just copy [Microsoft ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_interview)",Science/Technology,2019-04-23 21:52:51
Why is learning programming the de facto advice in this sub?,144,biwylz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/biwylz/why_is_learning_programming_the_de_facto_advice/,58,"Hi everyone! I am curious about the ground reality of people saying ""learn coding"" to get a job.

In this sub whenever I see a post that is made by a teenager struggling to find a job, be it people who already graduated, seniors in college or even freaking 12th grade students who couldn't get into prestigious colleges, people always seem to suggest them to try their hands on programming.

I feel this advice is misguided for anyone except college seniors. Working in the software industry requires you to have formal knowledge about the underpinning of various technologies. And this can only be acquired by going through a formal curriculum. Seniors from other majors can pick up on this quickly as most of them have had an introductory class on computer science in their freshman year and have batchmates who are computer science majors. I have seen many non computer science majors being placed in reputed companies by ""learning coding"" in their senior year.

But when we talk about the ones who have already graduated, it becomes tremendously hard to gather resources and devote time to go through those courses. Even if someone does do that, I can't seem to understand on why a recruiter might trust you on your skills. Having a degree and internships is what leads you to a company. I think unpaid internships would be a starter for this section of job seekers. But it would be a long term payout to get a paid job and I think one can definitely do a better job to get immediate returns rather than focusing on programming.

Finally, what made me write this post today is people suggesting it to someone who couldn't score well in JEE MAINS. Most probably the OP for that post hasn't had any prior introduction to programming. Doesn't this tantamount to society's misguided opinion of engineering/medical being the only path to success. Heck, we narrowed it down to programming on this sub. I do realise it is just a suggestion, but I feel this restricts him from exploring his own interests. Not scoring well in entrance exams could be a red herring that he is on the wrong path. Maybe that is what needs amends.

I would love to stand corrected on my views. Please share your opinions on why we collectively do so.

Thanks!",WhereIsLifeTakingMe2," [removed] I agree with you. There is life beyond, programming or JEE. Those one figured out way to deal with it, won't be asking questions here about options they have. We should engage more and give better solutions to young ones who are looking for the channels, avenues. 

One can become small town journalist, write stories, start printing wedding cards, electrician, plumbing, any kind of service sector with good level of social media reach Because that's what the majority of the sub's users are. They're all from an IT background. Their defacto advice is always that. randias advise : if you want to do something in free time , learn programming. If you have depression, hit the gym and delete Facebook. Also you shouldn't study engineering. Weird this post didn't get the traction. I need an answer too! Programming today is cool/looked upon like how speaking fluent or semi fluent English in 90's India was, it is a good touch to your portfolio. For majority of the non-cs and it branches core jobs related to their field are almost none. They pretty much end up in those mass it companies like tcs, so yeah that's why it is advised to learn programming as there is a high chance that you are going to end up on that path.

About other streams I don't really know. What other streams would you suggest? Hey, I think I am the one you are talking about. You can check my post history for verifying. 

I was specifically looking for coding advice because I love coding. I have completed python course from thenewboston, I know how use GitHub, I have account on stack overflow to clear my doubts and I am still doing a CS50 course whose sole purpose is to introduce students to computer science. I've written all this on post too. So, I am not sure you are specifically talking about me or not but if it's me, then I was looking for that advice, no one actually gave unsolicited coding advice to me Programming is high leverage. It's easy to learn. Most of the knowledge you need is found online.

I work in tech, and I've got no formal qualification other than 12th grade (I'm on a gap year after school). I'm also a part of an indie maker community, where it's fairly common to meet 16y/o kids who are self taught in almost every way bootstrapping startups, making good money. (Of course, software isn't the only pathway to this world and neither is it the only skill you need, but it's a good choice due to the high leverage it provides)

&#x200B;

>Working in the software industry requires you to have formal knowledge about the underpinning of various technologies. And this can only be acquired by going through a formal curriculum.

&#x200B;

Could you give me an example of such formal knowledge? I suspect someone who's motivated enough can pick up just about anything. Software happens to be a field without certain barriers to entry, like government certification which only graduates can apply for.

&#x200B;

>Having a degree and internships is what leads you to a company

It's one metric, but not the only. Ultimately, employers want someone who's performant at a task, and can be responsible for it. Degrees prove your knowledge and intelligence, but these can be good replacements when you don't have one:

* have awesome side projects that demonstrate ability
* write good articles or record podcasts which prove your depth of knowledge
* communicate your existing skills well
* learn to spot opportunities early (ex: reach out to founders working on cool startups that aren't widely known yet)

&#x200B;

That's a non-exhaustive list. And of course, you can have those alongside a degree. I share this opinion too. Everyone seems to give similar advice and I can't understand why! What? I thought selling door knobs we the default advice here!

/s Because it is a relatively easy skill to learn and has very high leverage and demand in the job market currently. I graduated jobless with a GPA of less than 5. Teaching myself programming was the easiest way out for me. Five years after my graduation, I was earning the famous 1.6lpm. Now, no one cares about my GPA or that I wasn't a IT grad. Only getting the first job was difficult. Programming provided an easy way out for me.

Obviously, mileage will vary for different people. I got lucky and was able to learn it easily enough. However, it should be no surprise that it is the most common suggestion. Another point to note is that programming is now used in nearly all industries, so you can supplement it after a few years with an MBA and try to do a career change.

Even now, if I see a jobless graduate who did Mechanical or Chemical or any other core fields, I'll suggest he/she try to get into programming unless they are really passionate about something else. Trust me, there's a real demand for **good** programmers. Am guessing , vast majority of this sub is engineers and therefore suggest what they know. I believe that programming will soon become a skill that everyone should possess, it will become normal, even in the non tech careers. In the coming years programming will become as common or necessary as speaking English was, or it will become the new standard for computer fluency. You don't need to know how to write immaculate code, but maybe knowledge of basic programming, algorithms and knowing how to read code will be required in the coming decades. I'm in Commerce and I have basic to super amateur  knowledge of javascript and python but mostly algorithms. It's where I can pick up coding in a few months without wasting time on learning super simple stuff and even beginner things. Programming as a tool is becoming relevant in many jobs. An accountant benefits by using basic functions in Excel to accomplish  complex tasks; a doctor can use Python to parse data from text and check for patterns;a civil engineer can customize the tool s/he uses by building modules for simulation;a hobbyist can try to program the problems like the numbers round of 8 out of 10 cats does countdown.... Bias :)

Guilty as charged. Because its the easiest way to learn a skill and start making money. A good, self taught developer can work and earn good money as a freelancer where degrees do not matter. Most of the advice related threads are about desperate people looking for a quick way out of their problems, hence it is the most obvious solution.

That being said, its not for everyone.

Log to ab free ki advice ke baare mai complain karne lage. 

/r/ChoosingBeggars I guess most people on this sub are coders who don't know the world outside coding.   
Don't get me wrong, it is a great skill to have. I am a coder, too but now I am trying to become a comedian. If you learn programming, you can build a solid career as a freelancer while getting paid in $

You can do the same with any other in-demand skill like marketing or content writing, but the path isn't as obvious with those, and you have to be really good to stand out agains the trash that litters freelancing sites for those talents Knowing coding without any formal education about finite automata theory, programming languages , compilers, os, data structures, algorithms and computer architecture is like blindly walking in the darkness. It would take you up till certain distance but eventually you will fall flat. 

So suggesting a teenager to code who's already under pressure for the whole year for entrance exam sounds daft to me. He needs to gather his shit , get into a decent engg college for education of computer science , get into those coding competition s and hackathons, spend time on hacker ranks and what not. And finally look for opportunities to do open source projects. And then perhaps get a master's degree to get more exposure while continuously working on his coding skills , getting a girlfriend or boyfriend , living a little and developing a hobby of reading good technical and non technical books.

This again is my personal opinion.

As far as working professionals are concerned,last time I checked , there were many nano degree offerings on the online education platforms. One can use them too. If this is related to my post then I do have prior coding knowledge(c++ and java) and i did get viteee slot 2 on the second day of counselling but i don't think i'll go cuz its not worth it and jee was shit(got 170) and i knew that but i was shocked to see people who scored 200+ to get 18k rank.I've decided to leave reddit and I've stopped using insta cuz bits is my only hope and i'm scoring around 330 in my mock tests.

"An Appeal: Please, do not jail PUBG users.",299,b0yd99,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b0yd99/an_appeal_please_do_not_jail_pubg_users/,74,"We cannot believe we are writing this. As per media reports which surfaced yesterday the Rajkot Police Department has arrested 7 youths for playing the PUBG online video game. Clearly things have spiralled out of control.

## A contested public debate

PUBG entered the mainstream lexicon in which the Hon'ble Prime Minister on January 29, 2019 while interacting with the concerns of a parent referred to it jovially. He clearly indicated in his remarks that, ""[*technology is a problem -- as well as a solution*](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/yeh-pubg-waala-hai-kya-pm-modi-aware-of-pubg-and-fortnite-addiction-offers-tips-on-how-to-deal-with-it-1442411-2019-01-30)"" and suggested patience and guidance as an approach for encouraging children to use their time productively. Alongside these remarks advisories were being issued by Child and Adolescent welfare bodies in some states including [Delhi](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/top-story/is-pubg-a-menace-delhi-child-rights-panel-says-game-negatively-impacts-kids/story/317245.html) and [Gujarat](https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/pubg-addiction-gujarat-government-issues-notice-to-ban-students-from-playing-pubg-or-any-other-addictive-game/352324) that the game was addictive and could cause negative impacts on children even beyond their academic performance.

It is important to take a step back this moment and consider the wider academic literature on the subject. The top three cited meta studies on Google Scholar on the general impact of gaming on adolescents indicate varying outcomes. Some even suggest benefits such as development and improvement of hand eye co-ordination (*remember the old Atari's?*).

https://i.redd.it/nfpahf4632m21.png

Yes, we may be completely wrong in an our inferences, but believe that this may be a matter for parental caution, and social debate but certainly not penal law. We explain the dangerous consequences of approaching this as a legal issue below.

## Prohibitory Order on playing PUBG

The Rajkot Police Commissioner has issued a prohibitory order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on March 6, 2019. A Section 144 order under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 is usually made to prevent illegal physical assemblies a breach of peace. While large numbers of online gamers do congregate and spend long hours in front of their smartphones or gaming consoles much to the annoyance of their friends and family such assemblies are rarely unlawful. It would be a stretch to call such activities as threatening public order.

Hence, we were surprised when a Kumar Manish posted this tweet:

We have today been able to have a [rough translation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16xDu9OqcEmEq8fRupJmcORiJv0wfpVvR/view?usp=sharing) prepared in English thanks to the help offered by Manan Bhatt.

From reading the prohibitory order, it is reasonable to infer that as per press reports, 7 youths ranging from the ages of 19 to 26 have been arrested for the breach of this prohibitory order. At this point we found ourselves bewildered and taken aback as this is seemingly a grave attack on personal liberty. We believe as the Hon'ble Prime Minister noted in his conversation that concerns on online gaming are better handled with the care and affection of a parent and teachers. Certainly not by creating fear of penal law, through prohibitory orders issued by the police and subsequent arrests. This is not only abhorrent to sensibility but offends our core fundamental rights as it lacks rationality and the reasonableness necessary in any restriction imposed by the State.

In the coming days we will be sourcing and authenticating information and taking steps including talking to a legal team based out of Gujarat. We hope to address this issue responsibly and meanwhile urge the Gujarat government to look into this matter urgently. We appeal to them -- *jailing people should not be a game*.

Advice needed for B-School.,8,ccqp9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccqp9z/advice_needed_for_bschool/,1,"I am doing a Bsc in Information Technology from a reputed college, placements are decent in our college, last year average was 4.5 lacs and highest was 18 lacs, this sounds pretty good for a college with very low fees but i don't see myself doing something in IT field, i cleared the entrances for VIT,KIIT,SRM,Manipal,COMEDK and few others but i did not join any of them for the very same reason, i was pushed into science by my parents and they were also forcing me to join KIIT(which i still can join) but i convinced them somehow for a Bsc as placements in KIIT were not as tempting as they had expected. I choose Bsc due to it's short duration, cost effectiveness and  curriculum was not much different from engineering if you don't include first year of engineering. 

&#x200B;

It's a relief for me that i only have to study 3 years in Bsc, now coming to the main question, at the end of three years, an MBA seems to me to be the most plausible way of getting out of this mess, my previous academics (10th,12th) are good and i can also score good my graduation.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Choose Bsc over Btech (don't like either of the two), want to do an mba.

&#x200B;

Now these are my questions :-

1) Does doing a Bsc instead of a Btech will have a negative impact during admission in B-Schools?

2) Are all these great packages that the top B-School pride themselves on are only for IITs/NITs graduates etc? 

3) What would you recommend for a person in a situation like this?

&#x200B;

If not top IIMs, i can surely get in top 10 schools.

&#x200B;

P.S - 1)My parents wanted me to do graduation only in CS,IT or Electronics, i have also cleared few entrances for BBA.

2) Money is not a problem, i'm open to all suggestions.

3) I want to go for a degree just after Bsc and don't want to work.",Ash_Sss," 1. Go for BSc, if you really want to go for MBA. Saves you from General Engineering Male (GEM) category.  

2. A BTech from an eminent institution can do wonders for you, no doubt about it. To strengthen your profile, take some work ex, if possible. 
Do things which strengthen your CV.   

3. Life has many ways of making you where you want to be and don't be overconfident about your abilities. 
Life will fucking test you, hope you pass with flying colors.   

Also, don't make MBA your main goal, venture out, hope you find something interesting.

Need for a change of school culture and the hype around class 10th and 12th board exams,35,bn13id,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bn13id/need_for_a_change_of_school_culture_and_the_hype/,8,"I am currently a Ph.D. in Biology student at a university in the United States of America. I completed my class 10th in 2006, and my class 12th in 2008. I scored 78.3% and 72% in the aforementioned board exams, respectively. During my school years, I was never a meritorious student. I was rather among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section academically. However, I worked really hard for my class 10th board exam and was deeply affected by the final percentage I scored. I did pretty well in the mock exams that I used to give at the private tuition center I took to help my academic performance and scored much more than many of friends majority of whom ended up scoring more than 85% in the final board examination.

&#x200B;

Till my class 10th, I studied at a prestigious public school in Delhi. As per the school's rule, a student could only be offered Science, if he/she scored more than 80% in English, Science, and Mathematics combined. My score was 77.7%, and therefore, was offered humanities and commerce. The rule didn't make sense as I scored 94% in Science, and my mathematics scores were always among the top 5-15% of the high scoring students in my section.  Therefore, I changed schools to study Science, and today I am earning a top-most degree in a field in which my school thought I was not a good fit.

&#x200B;

I suffered from depression and lack of confidence before my class 10th. I used to be good at cricket, but I suffered in that as well. My school carried a culture where if you are not good academically, then you are hopeless in other extra-curricular activities as well. I wanted to do academically well in school (prior to my class 10th), but the lack of confidence made it really difficult to come out of the shell and raise myself to glory (yes, being a good student did seem like a glory). I was so terrified that I would be scared to even open my textbooks.

&#x200B;

Not being able to get Science made things worse. I lost even more hope, and this worsened my mental health for my class 12th board exam. I remember praying to score at least more than 60% a night before the results. But, today if I could talk to my younger self, my recommendation would be to not lose hope and enjoy doing what you like. However, I still not sure if the environment that I lived would help. In my school days, I was compelled to feel like an outlaw for being among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section.

&#x200B;

Recently, an article came out on Hindu, about a mother congratulating her son for scoring 60% in class 10th. She says that she had seen her son struggle to the point of giving up, and therefore, was proud of the final scores he got. In my time, my parents were also in full support of me. So was my father, who had always been strict. My father would never come to the parents-teachers meeting, as I was not up to the standards he expected of me. But, after my class 10th, he was very supportive and backed me at every point possible. Getting this sort of support from this person was huge for me then. He tried his level best to make a case to my school principal as to why I deserve to be a science student for the last two years of schooling. But, I remember walking down the school corridor with my parents trying to make a last attempt to convince my school principal, I met my Geography teacher. She congratulated me sarcastically and ridiculed me (in front of my parents) of how bad of a student I was before. It has been 13 years since that gesture, but the instance is still registered in my memory from word to word.

&#x200B;

Therefore, this makes me wonder, whether how much of a support system would your parents be if you have such teachers and cultures inculcated in schools. At that time, my parent's support didn't help me much. In fact, it made me feel even more horrible for being responsible for letting them go through such tough situations. Manier times. especially I like to believe in my case, low scores in class 10th are due to a stroke of sheer bad luck. But, the impact is grave for a naive 16-year-old.

&#x200B;

The point I am trying to make is that in addition to having a good support system from one's parents, the school's culture of dealing with young students needs to change. Teachers have a big responsibility of training future entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers etc, and therefore need to pay proper regard to a students self-esteem and self-confidence. What might just seem to be a simple comment (and here I don't include the personal issues that teacher might sometime have) the repercussions on the student's mental health might be huge.

&#x200B;

Ironically, I got to know about this below-given news article from the same geography teacher's Facebook post. She was cheering this wonderful mother for her attempt to lift the pressure off the head of her son' young mind. I first felt like commenting directly about the hypocrisy she has shown to me at the least. But, I think I should probably try to let this memory go of my head and move on.

My mother’s a teacher, and I have literally seen her give advice to her student’s parents to give their children more freedom to find their passions, to have fun and to focus on then learning skills and confidence, rather than focusing on marks. But when it came to me, it was get marks or die. 

I think part of the problem is that in India there are so few means of evaluating a person beyond their marks. When applying to US universities, you have to write essays, jot down your clubs and extra-curricular activities, the interview will focus on the things you spend time on outside the classroom etc. The marks themselves are just the bare minimum. I feel in India the marks are supreme. I bet the entrance exam culture doesn’t help either.

It also sucks that there are so few premier institutions in India to study at, relative to our population. The US has flagship state colleges in every state, and at least 2 or 3 other unis that are fairly good, not to mention private world-class unis like Stanford and Harvard etc. We needs more high-quality institutes of higher learning, spread out throughout the country. The way they hype the importance of 10th board exams is sad. And the coaching classes are taking full advantage of it. 

My 10th board results stopped being useful once I got an admission in FYJC. I've grown up around people who often compared their kids to others and the first subject in hand is always to flex if their kid scored 90%. My parents have been really supportive though they never forced me to ""get better grades"" but I often felt I let 'em down which usually let to anxiety and depressing about the fact I'm no good.

To be honest I don't blame them marks are the only way around here to evaluate candidates for anything. Only if had been a more holistic evaluation but that's certainly out of the question because then only meritocracy will reign. I don't think everyone can  afford a school that emphasises on communication skills or everyone can buy a guitar just so to learn an instrument. Not giving freedom to children to pursue whatever they want is one of the main reason india is behind many countries in terms of innovation and in olympics.",Science/Technology,2019-05-11 01:26:12

I have lost all hope of having a life and being a burden on this world.
 
* I was a good student in school,in fact i was in the top,had some good programming skills then or i am not sure - it might be mugging up the whole programs and dump it out in the final exam. I even got a medal from my school with scoring 100/100 in computer science. You will see the irony of this later.

* Fucked up my 12th in science because i was homesick and had a tough time living in a hostel and because i was weak at maths. Now at this age, if you ask me some calculus which people do remember at my age - i do not. Not even 1 %. What that tells you about me?

* Prepared for medical entrance for a year paid by my father's hard earned money. Nothing came out of it. I was halfway into it and halfway hoping as if luck would be showered upon me and i would get through the entrance. But reality struck hard.

* Did Engineering in Instrumentation technology (a core stream ) from a good private college with good cgpa like around 8.5/10. But you know how i got it- i got through initial  1st 3 years studying and giving it somehow but the 4th year was tough for me- i cheated in the exams for almost all the subjects with chits and chits of paper i wrote in a minutes. 
I cheated through the exaams because i knew it was too tough for me to actually make sense of the subjects and i was afraid i might not even pass.

But all this was of no use anyway- that degree is just a certificate in a file now and is not worth a rupee now because on paper i am so and so engineer but in real life, i am a loser who has actually forgotten almost all of which i studied in those years. I guarantee that people are there who still know the fundamentals of a subject and can even give the exams after many years in engineering but i was not. My memory failed me or i caused my memory to fail - in any case i cannot remember anything of that Btech.

* Got placed in IT starting with the a company starting with the letter I - you know which one- in spite of having no spectacular programming skills and because it was not Xth std Comp Science which i had a false notion that i will be good at it and thus i chose to go with the company. 

* During the training period itself, i came to know that its too hard for me to do any actual programming. Passed after failing and giving a retest with literally some help from other kind trainees. Still i stayed there. I never left because you see on paper, i had passed but in reality i had failed.

* Got posted in Mangalore, lived there alone in a 1 RK.

* Wasted 4 years there, literally wasted in a support project where due to my inability, which may be they saw through me or just randomly , i was handed the L1 part-doing triage of the issues , and open a ticket, write a select query in Teradata, give that information to the client. Just that. Why nothing more ? Because i was too dumb to actually code or solve a real problem.

* Transferred to Bhubaneswar nearby to my home last year - just for the sake of it. I am still in the company, was on bench for almost a year and could not get project because i had no skills.
But they did not kick me out or neither i voluntarily did that.

* I am in a project right now which i got at the end of the year where they use TM1, Cognos, INFORMATICA, Unix, DB2. I literally don't know any of the technologies. Searching here and there, getting called by the leads as dumb, doing the least basic task which the lead has to explain to me - this is my life now.
On top of that , i keep on forgetting things which the lead would have told me the last week. 

I do not even understand the code other people have written in the existing systems, i do not understand how they would come up with such complex logic.

* I have lost the ability or may be never had logical reasoning skills which is needed to do programming - be it any language. I don't have the ability to think of a solution to any programming requirement, do not have the skill to divide the problem into blocks and solve it 1 by1. This is not Xth class stuff - this is the real world.
I have even lost the ability to even think of something to approach the problem.

This is my wasteful life. You know what i do instead of trying to improve - i indulge in viewing tv shows, podcasts,youtube anything to just pass time and not do something constructive.

I am a listless person with no energy to face the world. I do not have any skills to even get a different job. By the age of 29, people more or less figure how to earn for their family but i have still not figured out - nor i have the energy to think of it. 

**What is the point of living such a life ?**

I have procastinated, i have wasted my years when people try to make something out of themselves and people i know who were once below me in skills have gone on to try, struggle and are succeeding in their lives. But i did not.

Why should i exist when i am the burden on my world now (my father and mother although they are trying to help me but they cannot because i have reached the end) ? 

I am a wasteful, pathetic loser in life now.I do not even an ounce of energy to solve my problems. I somehow think if i take out myself out of the equation of lives of my family and they somehow forget that i ever existed, it will be great. I have no friends now as well.

I do not blame anyone for the condition i am in right now, it was me and me only. In spite of knowing that i am wasting time and instead of doing something constructive - anything, i indulge in viewing shows/songs/podcasts just to fill that time and get that moment of fleeting happiness.

Now dear reader, if you have read this far of my wasteful life i have lived, what will you tell me? That there is still hope - but i know there isn't. That somehow you will come out of it - but i know this will never happen.

Why should i not jump out of this balcony i am standing now and end this constant misery i am in? 

Why?

",Snoopyrun," Ok first of all, get off the balcony... 
I don't have any knowledge about engineering so maybe other users will be able to help you. What I do know is that life is never a cake walk. If you feel boxed in or lost, then please talk to your friends or parents. If it helps then write it down. Sometimes seeing your troubles on a blank sheet helps put things in perspective. 

This phase you are going through won't matter in 5 years, but if you jump off then it's going to affect your parents and friends for the rest of their lives.

Please talk to a therapist if you are feeling depressed.. all the best. But you survived ....Did engg , got into top IT firm , did some work , was not kicked out , called dumb but survived .....Passed by cheating ...But survived .....


Maybe mother life has a crush on you . Don't let down this mother ....

I had somewhat similar story but I also survived Hey man! I’m not here to say that everything will be alright. I just want to share my experience. My best friend committed suicide one and a half years back. He had severe depression and family issues. He’s gone since but I’m still around dealing with this life. We were a support system for each other. It was just much more harder for him. He thought that I had a girlfriend, so I’ll get by but it doesn’t work like that. Everyday i think about him and the life we could’ve had by staying close. But, nothing can be changed now. I can’t even imagine how his parents get by. He was their only son. Time doesn’t heal anything when people leave a hole in your life that can’t be filled. We were togther since school days. No one gave a fuck about his death so I even broke contact with other friends we had in common. I just couldn’t handle their indifference. So, my only request is, take some time and think about the people you’ll leave behind. I get suicidal thoughts too but that’s how i keep myself going and hopefully i’ll make it for these few for whom my existence matters. Yours matters too. Holy fucking shit dude, fuck programming then. Not everyone has the aptitude for that. So what?
You can start afresh. If IT makes you miserable then why keep doing it brother?

You can learn other skills on the internet, you're a smart guy. And stop fretting over the money your parents spent on your education. What else were they gonna do with it, buy a Ferrari? Money comes and goes. Forget about it.

Don't beat yourself too much about it. How about you list five great qualities you think you have, and five industries or areas you are passionate about (unrelated to IT)? Life is too precious to end it for not being able to do programming. You're only 29. You have years of productivity ahead and it's never too late.  [deleted] **First, I could not even take my own life. That is unfair, isn't it?** That a person has no control over his life.

I was standing on a chair in the balcony and tried to do it at 12 am. But I didn't. I stayed standing there for I think 20-30 mins. My mind was in overdrive mode thinking of everything it could think of and rushing through emotions.
I had prepared an email with all my account details which I would send to someone dear to take care of my parents. I had written a last letter to my parents, my siblings. 
But I couldn't do the final act. The only reason is my mother will be shattered and I know the implications it will have on my family.

But its unfair, isn't it? They say suicide is done by cowards, so, yes I am a coward running away from everything. Yes, I agree but what if there is no other choice left for a person in my state.

**16th March - I slept from 2 am till 10 am. Then again i fell asleep from 4- 8:30 pm. That is my state now. I am exhausted mentally, physically. I do not even have an ounce of energy to go further.**

I am from a middle-class family. My parents have struggled and have done much more than I could ever imagine. My dad used to drop me on his cycle first, then by a scooter to a convent school in my native place every day, every fucking single day. They chose that school for me because it was the best in that area although they struggled through to go by every day. 
My mom, I can't even begin what to write here. 

They did everything that would make a son capable enough but see what I am now. A wasteful burden on them now from my point of view. 

So my question is why should I go through this drivel of a life I have? 

* **Do we know why we as human beings exist on this planet/galaxy/universe?**
* **Do we know why we go through the turmoil in life and go through its various stages just to end on a death pyre?**
* **Do we know why we were born to a particular religion and not in the other?**
* **Do we know why we were born in a certain speck of land on Earth and not at the other speck?**

No, the answer to all questions is **NO.**

Then has someone asked why we do not know the answer to all these questions? Yeah, many have and many say they have even found the answers as well.
But do we know for sure these illuminated beings ever existed truly?

NO again, we don't. Everything is random in this universe. 

Everything grows and then entropy kicks in and one day everyone - I include everything in this category, living beings and non-living entities as well - everything has its end and the cycle continues.


* All these man-made sections/strata of the society - why they exist in the way they are right now?

* All these religions over which wars/conflicts are fought - has anyone seen their god. What about the other religion's god then? Which God will come and save me? 

Why a person like me is struggling through this drivel of a life I have been ""blessed""? Why me? The answer is the fault is I, as a being, me.

Nobody will save me but myself. It is all my responsibility now to come out of the hell hole I am in and solve my problems- it is my responsibility- me, a severely depressed waste of a being?
I write with tears in my eyes.

How do I solve it? How? 

All of you kindred souls who have tried to help me with their comments, DMs which by the way I may die happy one day knowing you all exist in this fucking cruel world - kind empathetic beings - Thank you to each and every one of you!!

This is my mental state right now: **They as in you dear souls say ""its never too late"" but I think the time has already gone past ""late"" for me.**
 Dude, you are still earning some money.  There are literally millions who can't. Get off the balcony man. And things change man. You said you procrastinated in your life. Lets try together to be more discipline. We will start small like waking up at 5AM, some exercise, some learning and that is it. Nothing big is required to change life. 

You are a great man, who did wonders in life and you will surely do wonders again. All the best man. And i seriously said same thing to one more user, and i am saying it to you you want i will msg you daily at 5AM. 2019 will be best year of our life, we will make it. Don't you fucking do it, man! Nothing's over! Suicide is never the answer. You might not give a shit about yourself right now but others do. Talk to someone. You have value, you very much contribute to the society. Fuck anyone that implies otherwise!

I'm here apathetic, drowned in depression and jobless, but I'm still here. So should you be. As long as you here, you will always have a chance to really live. Do not lose hope. This isn't the end. 

Just know that you'll be hurting a lot of people, the ones in your life as well as us. It's the most selfish thing to do. So, be strong and stay with us!

Please don't go, man. Your in the top 10% Indians being in the middle class, you have a education and a solid degree. 

You have experience and you know your weak points. You do not have any debts or money problems, your health is good no issues. 

I think your stuck in a rut but are also aware of your responsibilities to your father and family, I won't say what will happen if you leave them. 

Whats the solution ? go on a nature trip or go to Thailand, break the routine or commit marriage lol    First of all get off the ledge or the balcony and just sit in your room. Suicide is never an option it is an escape for you but not for everybody else. Your parents are the one who have to live bearing the fact that they were not able to understand their child and maybe something they could have done to prevent this. 
Secondly this is not the end different people learn at different pace maybe it is taking you too long learn the stuff but you will get there eventually. Even if you don't get there give it time and you will find something to do which you consider worthwhile. 
What you are going through I did too at one point in my life so I made some changes and I am still struggling but I am getting there. You too will find your way just give it time.
 Dude, you made it. You got into a top IT firm and were on the bench for a year and still didn't lose your job. That most likely means that they know you have some talent. Also, you were smart enough to cheat your way through college, the way I see it is that if you're smart enough to cheat on tests and get away with it, then you deserve your grades. Anyway, get off the balcony, there are many ups and downs in life, but you are by no means a failure and you'll get through this.  For your family . No other reason. 
It doesn't matter what you do. The important thing is whatever you do is bringing money into the family or can bring money into the family and translate into food, clothes, a little bit of happiness, etc. 

Not sure if you are middle class, but if you are, that will just leave your dad,mom possibly your siblings in shambles. 
You don't want your dad to waste his hard earned pension ( for possibly working on the same job for 35 years so his son can do things he could not) on the funeral ( which will cost money as well) rather than saving it for a medical event right? 

Anyways, the way you have presented your logic and your life story, it didn't seem like you are not skilled for job. On the contrary , you could be in sales a few years down the line ..
Don't waste your life. I have been there , dropped out of engineering to attempt medicine . Could not make the cut do did my engineering again ...barely passed. 
 But doing ok today sitting here in nz...

Just learn from your dad n don't give up. Get what you want. Don't expect everything to come to you...long life ahead...best of luck...

Get the fuck inside.... If you don't like coding, do something else dude. There is a lot of the world you have yet to explore. Try to get an onsite oppurtunity, if possible. Or if you have enough money, go on a vacation yourself. Your job is not the only thing defining you. You don't even need to do a job if you have enough money to live, which I assume you do.

And yes, please do get off that fucking balcony. I've been in situations in life where I've felt the same, but today I look back and think how stupid I was. I sometimes laugh at my own stupidity.

Surround yourself with positive people, friends, colleagues, family. People you are happy to be around. People are more important than your job.  Please talk yo a psychiatrist or psychologist to get some professional help. 
This life on earth is a fucking miracle. Remember even the poor persons have the oppertunisties and resources of a rich man in 80s. The world change rapidly. You will find a lovely women and have most wonderful children. Life is not about achieving things, life is about being in the moment and being kind and helpful to other people. If you can give a meal to a hungry kid or some education to a tribal village etc. There's so much to do on this earth to make this better place for ourselves and for future generations.
I suggest you to read ""Man's search for meaning"" by Victor E Frankl. Our grandparents withstood plagues, storms, animals, cruel kings, slave owners, everything. We all have what it takes to be here. Remember you have faced even worse things in the past and have stood strong, you will do it again. Take care.  My friend is an engineer and has said multiple times she has forgotten most of what she has learned and that her degree is basically simply proof that she knows how to learn. Perhaps you're not meant to be in the field you are in. What excites you? We can be wildly successful in life when we move toward our passion and excitement.
Please get down off of the balcony. I understand your feelings and they are valid. Comparing our lives to others is a dangerous game. Happiness is a choice, a choice we keep making over and over again when we choose to move toward that which we love.

Best wishes to you. Dont beat yourself up. We all have brilliant gifts to offer the world. What is yours? You are still young and there's a lot of things you can do to improve your performance at work. First of all you should let go of the mentality that you're not good enough. Be confident that you can better yourself, your past education is an indication that you're smart. 

Your job is not an exam, you have the luxury of ""copying"". If you find it difficult to remember things, take notes. Write down the things your Lead says and refer to them next time around. I have big database of notes (on onenote) that I refer to all the time.  Set small goals, try to learn a small thing that your project uses in a day or two. Slowly you will become more confident, and slowly you will gain experience and will be able to see common solutions that are being applied. 

Most of what you think looks complicated, usually just involves one or two key ideas. And often these ideas are copied from some other projects ""solution"". That sort of thing comes with experience, as you see more code you'll get the hang of it.

For now, just concentrate on small things. Start by taking notes so you don't have to ask your lead the same questions again.  Any update OP? Let me give you a big hug, brother.

Success in career doesn't imply success in life, man. I have a friend who left his engineering job to work as a volunteer in a guest house in Manali. He doesn't have money but gets enough for him and he loves it. Point being, if you don't have aptitude skills or if you really hate the choosen career, change to whatever is comfortable for you. You may even take sabbatical first or if you have saved some money, take a break from career and go travel.

Many people including me don't have a passion in  anything, work or hobby. But we still carry on with uninteresting job and work struggles but enjoy little things in personal life. It is a balancing act. One activity pays you to feed you physically, the other activity feeds your soul.

Socializing can also help you out. Reach out to your friends. If you don't have, there are many groups in the Metropolitan cities for every activity. Register in meetup.com. Follow groups for book reading, arts and crafts, sports, travelling, etc., whichever your interest is in. All are strangers with common interests. They welcome everybody with open hands.

I was very reserved once. Had a terrible phase and felt like screaming and running like the Tare Zameen Par kid in school ground. One day morning I woke up and literally ran on the street. Was huff puffing and couldn't run more than 400m. But it felt good to vent it out. After 3 years, now I can run about 15km. It is one thing that keeps me sane and fit.

Initial steps are the hardest. I hessitantly joined a travel Meetup group, signed up for a trip. Now those strangers I met on first trip are still friends with me. Go take your first steps to get out of your comfort 1RK zone. May be you'll make friends who might even become your roommates. Just get off the balcony, life hits you in the guts pretty bad once in a while, but you don't let it goddamn knock you out, you hear me son? Hold you chin up, walk down those stairs and start working on yourself. Life isn't called life because it is meaningful, it's called life because it is lived. And if nothing seems to be working, just think ""Maa ko bura lagega"". This is the second post like this I saw today here !!! What is this trend ???  First of all, you got to understand being alive is a gift that needs to cherished. Second part, in all its beauty , life is not easy. There's the hard reality of everyday life and the assumption of what your life should be. Any imbalance and your mind starts to play tricks on you. Remember all you thinking is on the basis of your experiences and knowledge with no factoring in the awesomeness of tomorrow.

The problem is we always see the success in others but never the hard work that went in behind. If you want to change your life, you need to first take a check on what you want, where you are and where you want to be. 

Doing a read, you have accomplished so much already. Give yourself some credit for accomplishments and don't dilute these because of what your assessment says. You seem to have taken some failures too hard. All of us have gone through failures. The thing is how many of these failures would you remember years down the line. So dont take them so much to heart. You don't seem to like coding. You need to apply to some other field inside IT more suitable to you. You seem to be a sensitive person , you might be someone more suitable to a people interacting role instead of L1/L2 work. Look for opportunities. Things take time but work.   

Before I end this comment, get off that balcony. Think about the tears and misery that would be left behind just because you couldnt realise how loved and wanted you are. Check with your parents, if you dont believe me. Let me leave you with words my grandpa told me when things looked hopeless for me - if you don't believe in yourself, why would the world believe in you. So light that fire in your heart to achieve all your heart sets out to do. Good luck man and you are not alone. You will survive and thrive!! No man, don't do this to your self. I may not have some broader or deeper explanation to give you but bro please don't do it.

Check if you can do civil services exam or some shit that is out of IT field. I think you have the basic aptitude to crack it.

Cool down! stop thinking about death. Reply us to so we can know you are alive. Please don't do it. You seem to have a lot of thoughts running in your head all the time. Just take a moment. You don't have to solve all your issues today. Try to help your mom with cooking or your younger siblings with their work or clean your room. Do something basic you will feel better.  Hey man, I was on the similar boat as you're right now. So I could definitely relate to what you're feeling right now. I hate when someone brings up their personal story when I was telling about my problem, but now I feel you may want to hear my story so that you can see the parallels. 

Good student at school, did ECE in college, fucked up all the 4 years just bunking classes and drinking, because that's what last benchers do. Finished with 68% with no knowledge on electronics, little on computer science. Rejected by all companies, finally got into TCS via off-campus. I wanted to be a java developer, but I was put up in internal support project. When many of my friends got h1-b and moved to US via client projects, I was attending service desk calls, installing MS-office in client machines, changing keyboard/mouse by going to their location - I was doing this for freaking 2 and a half years. I fought for release, but I was told either shut up and work or quit the job. I wasted 4 years in college, 2.5 years in TCS - 6.5 years of my potential growth time. 

I'm seeing interns in my company who're having more knowledge than me 7years experienced guy, it does sometimes make me feel low about myself, but hey everyone have got their own battles. I can't change the past, so I'm focusing on my present and future.

Look back at your past and learn lessons from it. Don't judge your present, future based on that. 

Think about this for a moment. You have a place to live, food to eat, earning money to pay the bills. First feel grateful for that. We humans tend to worry about things we don't have but fail to appreciate what we have in hand. 

Second, you feel you wasted your life. You're right, you wasted your life, you were irresponsible and you should take complete responsibility for that. What are you gonna do about it? 

> I somehow think if i take out myself out of the equation of lives of my family and they somehow forget that i ever existed, it will be great.

That's where you're wrong. If you take yourself out of the equation, you're going to inflict an unbearable pain, misery in your parents lives, which they will carry for rest of their lives. 
I'm sure this is definitely not what you want to do. 

Third, you're just 29, you've a long life ahead. This is not the end of the world. It's good that you've shared your thoughts and reached out for help. It means that you're acknowledging your feelings and open for suggestions. Life doesn't change in overnight, you'll wake up to a same shitty life, but it does change. It may change slowly, but eventually it will. You just have to put efforts for that and be patient enough to see it. Five years down the lane, you'll look back at this post and laugh about it. 

Feel free to dm me, if you want to talk personally.  You know depression and anxiety can interfere with memory and cause confusion. First and foremost lose them, and think of the work you are doing as achieving a higher purpose - like advancing the world economy, or advancing your financial and family well being. Then break down your work into really small tasks and focus on them one by one. Literally start living your life around your work, except on weekends and after you reach home. Keep on thinking about your micro tasks and how to complete them. Think about what went behind designing all that complex logic. They too were designed by humans like you, not aliens. The only difference is, they were designed piece by piece, and recorded into the computer. So you too focus on them piece by piece. 

&#x200B;

All the best and do not even think about jumping because quite frankly, this isn't even anywhere near a serious a issue that might make a person consider it. Dude at least have the courtesy to reply to your wellwishers sooner or later.
Sound advice in the above comments.

I might sound arrogant but you literally are playing the victim card. Your reasons aren't sound. Sure, you screwed up in the past but that cannot be the reason to justify why you persist in fucking up your present. Life doesn't work that way. Get the fuck up, look yourself in the mirror and commit to get yourself out of your hellhole. 

And jumping off the balcony is just you trying to escape your responsibilities. Sure, you might escape it but your family won't. They'll still have to face everything w/o you and know what? It's going to be fucking hard on them. It'll be He'll for them. We are just strangers on a forum. We can only sympathise but God knows what your family might have to go through.

All is not gone. Quit cribbing about your past. At least you have a family to fall back on and a menial job to support you. There are people who have asked for help because their parents are abusive, they ran away from home, ready to work lowly jobs to support themselves in a forgin city.

I wish the best for you and your family. 
 Please talk to somebody. Regardless of what you think about your situation, it is not as bad as you make it in your head - the minute you talk to somebody who truly cares about you about this they will help you realize this. You have so much of your life to do any multitude of things. Please talk to someone, anybody immediately. I'm not very good at expressing things, so not entirely sure if my words will do any good. But I'll try it anyway since you seem really down. First of all I'm also closing in on 29, so we're same generation I guess. I used to get panic about life after btech while I was in btech 3rd year and I wasn't even the elder child and my father had passed away when I was 16. But responsibilities are not that bad. You're not married or anything right? So may be focus on simple things like sending some money home (what you can with the salary you have), make occasional calls to family. What I've noticed as I grew up is, I get worried about the bad things that could happen to me. But when it happens, I somehow get past it, may be not successful, but I move on. Because time keeps moving, so even if something shitty happens, we'll get past that. Think about the simple things you can do, bad things will happen, but let's face it as it comes.

Second thing regarding job, it sounds extremely likely that you're in the wrong field. Good news is that you have a steady income. So use your spare time and the think and search for fields that you might enjoy. You don't even have to find the dream perfect job, just something that sounds better and doable is enough. I know lot of people find their job extremely rewarding and stuff. But majority of us kinda find something not too bad and stick to it. In your case, it sounds like a miserable fit for you. So start looking for fields, which probably dont need a lot of maths or programming. I'm in no way a career counselor or anything, but start with simple google searches. 

Hope I didn't make it worse at least. :|

 The only vow I have taken before 'converting' from a OCD obsessed religious ritualistic person to a nihilist atheistic person is ""to never commit suicide no matter what the mental situation is"". Because I will definitely be disappointed and sad with myself as I always had so much dreams and expectations.

Note that those with impulsive-ADHD symptoms can virtually never know the meaning of success because their mind keeps losing interest. So it's not our fault, it's our brain's. It forces us to delay everything and procraste. (visit r/ADHD)

Once I took a break and focused to think myself (also took some grass just to think, note that it is a bit dangerous to think to yourself as you may lose sense of reality and end up doing something horrible. So don't act based on these thoughts), all these OCD thoughts came out and I ended up insulting myself infront of many, which was a good thing because it made me actually humble. Like it is OK to lower yourself and be more of an actual human. It also forced me to see a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with **""Reactive Depression""** which exactly describes my situation: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustment_disorder 

It's all because of your mind, know that you are always useful to the world in some way. The world needs you and do things that can help humanity. 

TLDR: Lower yourself and go see a psychiatrist. nope you are not a loser if you call the life you lived a loser's life then people like me who has more worse life then yours is seriously don't have reason to be alive.
and bro am just 22 fucked by life a lot still living in a good hope. I gurantee you never trust your future. my future fucked me up many time you will never know what your future going to give you. I thought am gonna plan my life my little bit own way but my life didn't liked it the future I thought is no where near me. so first don't trust the future.

and about procrastination is easy to kill there are many tricks to kill you can found books on it.

and remember yes life is a hard and easy game both we got a day as a  daily level. timing is same it is just sometimes we got difficult boss or easy boss to kill in a day. how you survive it the way you handle it is your ability to play and remember you are best player you got. not somebody else so play it with fun.don't think people don't care about you they care it is just nature rule we have to survive in this life if we seriously got everything for free or by from family there is not fun in this man. see this thing imagine you survive this days of your life now you got a story to tell to world how people and things helped in your life.you can help somebody in your life who living a life like you.

Can program a NodeJs Rest API without any framework But Can't get in College. What to do ??,8,bgfv3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bgfv3e/can_program_a_nodejs_rest_api_without_any/,38,"It's a big one, TL,DR at the end.

Hey, I am 18 and just passed out from school. I did not do anything great in school. I am a average student and I suck at maths. I took science because nothing else works and i genuinely want to be a Computer Engineer. 

All though my childhood I was facilitated by computers and amazed by the Internet. So I got curious about it. I learned HTML, CSS and JS. After that I learned Java as it was in my ICSE syllabus. Then after passing class 10, Node Js  became very popular due to React/angular, so I started to learn it. I got no tution and all day I would watch Tutorials and code. I didn't do any social media. No Facebook, no Instagram and no Reddit. Just come home from school, start my computer and code.

I feel like I have a good grip over NodeJs. I know most of the core modules like http/fs/crypto. I made a Blockchain with Node as Crypto currency also fascinated me. Everything was so cool. Did not made friends , could not talk to any girl but I was happy with myself. Got 50% in class 11 finals.

In class 12 tried to focus on studies but got sidetracked very soon. Studies is so boring. Facebook came out with a new technology called GraphQL which changed how APIs communicate. Learned React(Popular JavaScript Framework), learned Haskell and golang. Made a bunch of projects, it's on my GitHub of any of you want to see.

Completely fucked my exams, some how passed. In February I got really serious and completely disconnected from internet and wiped my computer. Prepared had for ISC finals and did well.

But now the problem is I suck at Maths and I sucked at JEE mains. So I am fucked up. I did nothing what a regular teenager would do but got no reward. 

I love computers and I love to solve problems and I want to be a Computer Engineer. I don't care if I get money or not , I just love to play with computers. If I don't get in a college, I will get kicked out of my house. All this is giving me anxiety issues and causing depression

Tldr: love computers and love making cool stuff with computers but never focus on studies. What to do?

Any help?",sayanmallick," You definitely have a knack for coding but you seem to be making the same mistake that I made for 8 years, i.e. assuming CS = coding. I'm gonna be honest here, there is nothing special in writing a Node REST API from scratch without any framework. Anyone can whip that up with 6 months of experience with NodeJS.  
  
I had a look at your github. There is nothing 'useful' that I found on it. I may be wrong here.  
  
Now for the solution. I was at the exact same spot last year except I loved Math but was shit in Physics and even more shit in Chemistry. So I flunked JEE, dropped a year, gave JEE again this year but I'm not getting into any CFTIs. What I recommend is you make peace with the fact that you did fuck up. And now take admission into any college (college doesn't matter in case of CS) and learn ACTUAL CS with MITOCW.  
  
If you aren't good with vectors, matrices and calculus, you're gonna be stuck in the IT coolie industry doing irrelevant work. if you dont get into a college, drop me a line and I thought gifted kids was a myth. I am stunned. how is this even possible. Github? Look at admission process of IIITD AND IIITH. They give some points to good programmers. If not then join some private college like SRM/VIT and continue your efforts, will surely get a solid job off campus. College doesnt matter much in CS. Discord? Dude, you have to either do Btech or (BCA + MCA) to be eligible for a company where you can utilise your coding skills. It doesn't matter much if you're from a tier 3 college if you are a good coder and prove yourself. you can join MSC IT Indian education system is not ready for you.

 https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/City-girl-drops-out-of-school-enters-MIT/articleshow/53936680.cms Are you giving any exam other than JEE M? Ya no one gives a fuck
You are fucked you should have focused on studies these things can be learned by folks in 3rd or 4th year some folks learn it in job 
Real CS is Algorithms and Data structure 
which requires good maths you mentioned you are weak in Maths so ya no competitive programming for you 
It’s all about IIT if you are  not in you are fucked no matter what P&C you try you will always regret it 
 
My suggestion 
end it all

Now, my university is going to force me to take their summer training on web development which is the thing that I totally hate. My SGPA is 8.76 as I focused more studies and less on learning any specific technology. I have some projects but, only one big project in which I developed a program for the tech event that was hosted in our university. 

My area of interests are Data Science, Computer Vision, and Psychology. I tried to get into Data Science but, seniors said that learn Mathematics first. When I tried Computer vision, they said learn linear algebra first. So, I started learning linear algebra as well. So, now I am just banging head over books.  I don't know what to do, I am stuck.

Thank you!

EDIT: I have 2 years drop that is the reason  I am more worried.",Kaori4Kousei," [deleted] good to see that you are emphasizing on learning new technologies in first year itself. unlike the  majority who keep mugging up just for grades There are 2 parts about Computer Vision. Theory and practice. Theoretical computer vision is quite difficult and requires a certain degree of knowledge in linear algebra as you mentioned. The practical part of it - not so much. You have OpenCV for that.

This is shallow but given that you're just in your first year, you should definitely try out OpenCV with Python. It's quite simple and the library has implementation for a lot of stuff. The problem with learning just the theory is that you don't see any reward and it's very difficult to continue. But if you make some software which does some cool stuff, albeit simple, you'd feel rewarded and you'd actually like to continue doing so.

So if you are really interested in learning computer vision, spend your 40-50% of time (that you spend learning linear algebra) in making things and rest of it in learning the theory. [deleted]",Science/Technology,2019-04-29 19:17:25
Life at crossroads.. Please help.,24,b4w7e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4w7e9/life_at_crossroads_please_help/,17,"Hello everyone, 

I'm pretty stuck now. I am 23 and due to various reasons I haven't been able to pursue a good education. I had to stop at 11th and it's been years now.. I've been depressed so far and have only recently started to recover. 

I don't have anyone to turn to regarding the advice I seek.. What can I do with my life now? I have heard differing opinions and my first choice was to choose a regular college... but I don't know if they accept people at my age. To be clear, I can only apply at 24 since I would need to finish 12th this year. Should I choose NIOS for that or something else? Is going to a regular college an option for me?

The other option is distance learning and I have heard polarising views on it. IGNOU would have to be it but is it really worth it? Should I just go to a regular college if I'm able to? 

I'm also stuck regarding what to do for 12th, I would like to do science stream but since I haven't been taught anything for years, the maths and science is expected to be quite tough for me. The other option is humanities, which is easily my strength however, I am looking to study and get into an IT field. Psychology was my preferred option but I would need to study around 7-8 years for to be a clinical psychologist. I don't mind that but realistically, it isn't a great option since I'll be around 30/31 then. So I've decided to go for my second option, I'm trying to study programming on my own and try to get ahead with it. But I'd need a degree, would it be better I get it from a distance learning course or regular? If so, would BCA/MCA or BTECH/MTECH be good? It looks to be pretty tough considering I haven't touched any higher level maths. But, I'm willing to work. Please offer any advice, I'll take anything.

Or do you guys recommend something else for me? My strengths are that I'm good at speaking English and I generally have a good knack with languages. I'm good at subjects such as history, sociology and psychology. I'm good with technology and IT field interests me greatly.",Sangreslash," [removed] In which country did you stay?
You could consider becoming a translator. There are many ways you could study to become a translator via distance education courses. clear 12th , get into ANY college(not distance learning) with computer science / electric degree , prepare for interview questions like crazy from n number of site. get a job .

and yes most importantly , stop feeling you have missed out on anything or you are generally late . what has happened has happened. getting up and putting your shit together is what its all about.

Discussion of the Blasphemy laws in India,17,bff7ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bff7ef/discussion_of_the_blasphemy_laws_in_india/,2,"National Laws on Blasphemy: India 
As a home to numerous religious and ethnic groups, India has a number of laws against hate speech that fall under the “reasonable restrictions” to freedom of expression permitted in the Indian Constitution. Specifically, Sections 124A, 153A, 153B, 292, 293, and 295A of the Indian Penal Code prohibit any words or representations that insult any individual’s or group’s religious beliefs, or that are meant to incite enmity against a particular religion. The punishment for hate speech is a fine, imprisonment for up to three years, or both. Members of all of India’s faith groups can and do utilize anti-hate speech legislation when their religious sensibilities are hurt. Recent arrests include newspaper editors for articles criticizing the public nudity of certain Jain monks and arguing for the right to critique any religion, the latter of which angered Muslims; unprosecuted complaints have been filed by Buddhists against an actress who posed nude against a Buddha statue, and by Hindus against an athlete who ate beef during a cricket match.

Opinion
In the light of these policies and the overly polarizing society over religion I would like to state to right wing majoritarian bias this which has been developing.
Despite the famously secular constitution of the world’s largest democracy, concerns about Hindu nationalism and interreligious tension have risen under the premiership of Narendra Modi. Playing into this threat, “blasphemy” laws exist and are being increasingly used and cited.
Section 295 of the Indian Penal Code criminalises insult to religion; it allows up to three years imprisonment and fines for “whoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of citizens of India, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of a class.”
In addition, in 2011 the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology issued new rules requiring operators of social media networks to screen and remove blasphemous content within 36 hours of receiving a complaint.
In January 2015, the well-received and record-breaking high-grossing Bollywood film PK satirised problems with religion through the eyes of an alien in human form. It was criticised by Hindu nationalists who disliked its satire on “godmen” and called for a ban on the film and a the arrest of its star Aamir Khan and the filmmakers.
Director and writer Rajkumar Hirani responded by explaining, “In fact, with PK, I am saying that we are humans first and not Hindus or Muslims. Everyone should have the freedom to live and get settled with whoever they want to”.
In April 2012, the Catholic Church filed a complaint under Section 295 of the country’s penal code against Sanal Edamaruku, president of the Indian Rationalist Association. Edamaruku had reportedly exposed a supposed “miracle” by revealing that a weeping Jesus on the cross was actually the result of a leaky drain. The local police requested Edamaruku turn himself in and face the charges. He now lives in exile in Finland.
On August 20, 2013, leading anti-superstition campaigner Narendra Dabholkar was shot and killed by two men on a motorbike. The murder came just days after the state government pledged to re-introduce an anti-superstition bill, aimed at making it an offence to exploit or defraud people with ‘magical’ rituals, charms and cures. This bill was closely associated with Dabholkar’s work, and was opposed by many rightwing and Hindu nationalist groups who labelled it “anti-Hindu”.

From <https://end-blasphemy-laws.org/countries/asia-central-southern-and-south-eastern/india/> 

In the more recent news people like Yogi Adityanath and Sadvi Pragya have critizied those who do not follow the principles of hindutva to the point of down right attacking them claming them to be anti religion and anti national. Which would mean that any one who critics the Polarizing hindutva ideology is a anti-national even tho in reality the principles of Hindutva in all aspects against the long standing tradition of Indian culture. It was rightly said by Dr. Shashi Tharoor in his book ""why I am a Hindu"" states that India is not in its ecence a secular [implying the separation of religion from public matters] but a pluralist nation in its functioning, that is to say that that the Indian society as a whole and the government has a active role in the religious functioning of the society, equally for each religious sect. in simple terms the government of India grands national holidays on all religious festivals for all the recognized religions, instead of giving no holidays for any religious festival. He in his book has very clearly defined the distinction between Hindutva and Hinduism, an who miss guided the right wing is unable to differentiate between the obsolete and legally problematic idea of Cultural nationalism, believing Indian culture is solely hindu, and ignoring the fact that the nationalism which is best suited for every one is territorial Nationalism, which allowed every India regardless of all secondary identifiers of his individual identity, to pledge his or her allegiance to the nation and the values enshrined in the constitution while being able to critic others for their fallacies and praise them for their good deeds with out this loyalty to a cause be questioned. But we follow the procedure of the right wingers Tharoor should be an anti national who doesn't understand the values of the country. 
The actions and statement of the right wingers, who claim to up holed the ancient roots of India, violet the above mentioned sections in so many ways. This dose not apply just to the politician of stage but the large masses of people who support such people, and are the ground work of the polarizing  tactics which are aimed at the policy of divide and rule. It is not the center actively supports it, but it dose turn a blind eye to such problems in many cases. There are many postes and memes on the internet which violates the above mentioned Penal code sections, and yet they are ignored as they do not create drastic social upheavals. Yet these circulated in enough number to start a slow buildup in the momentum towards t a society moving towards polarizing ideas, and these masses change the out look of the society and ultimately end up in a group large enough to vote people like the Yogi and potential the Sadhvi into power. The consequences of this is already seen in the state of UP. I ma not saying that the Yadav government was any better in improving the life's of the people, but the BJP has changed the out look and from of the political momentum. Never has a  religious figure come to the power of a elected office in India, and it would be foolish to assume that the ideals of tolerance and equality would be met  as expected, which no hit to ward favoritism towards the religion of the elected official. 
The vague definition of Defamation and insult has given rise to the more frequent invocation of the above mentioned section of the India Penal Code, when ever the majorities views are challenged, and when the same is done to the minorities their voices are suppressed as the people in power openly criticize the victims them self's, or just turn a blind eye. There are many places due to this, majorly in North India where a cow has more support and protection than a Human who followed a different faith from the mainstream majority. And in many cases where there have been a probe into  these matters there is little attention payed to why the people become so fanatic to kill some one over their beliefs, and rather focused on forensics to confirm where the meat was of that of a cow or not. Implying that if the meat was that of a cow, the lynch mob did the right thing? Ludicrous!!

I Personal y think that blasphemy should not be a crime at all as it is a strong infringement of freedom of speech. I find it unfair that may religions can put up posters and legally have the right to promote their religion. But as and Athies if is were to put a banner starting 'god I'd not real stop wasting time and money behind imagenay entities' I am sure I would offend enough people to get me charged with a lot of things, and my banner will be brought down and most likely there would be a mob man hunting me, because they just love their scape goats.",KaranParindraDesai," There should be a middle ground. Criticising a religion should never be a crime. However, some people could do stupid things to provoke a religious group intentionally to create unrest in society. For example, drawing a cartoon of Muhammed or Buddha should never be a crime, but it should not be obscene or extremely derogatory. Also, I think intention is important. If the creator is a social reformer or an atheist, she should be given more free pass than a religious bigot who wants to malign another sect she hates.",Science/Technology,2019-04-21 02:10:29

There are various categories in this kind of management. For example, technology, packaging, research (citizen science) or just awareness. What according to you does India need right now? 

I recently watched videos on how birds die after eating plastic. Their stomachs are full of small tiny plastic bits, some upto 200 small pieces. They eventually choke on a piece and die. This is common near the beaches.

Packaging is the biggest contributor to plastic waste. How can we reduce this?",paintedpineapple," Rwanda has banned plastic bags in their entire country. Yes, it is a small country with a population of 10 million (but more densely populated than India) and very poor too. But just have a look at how clean their capital city Kigali is. Not innovative, but a very traditional idea: recycle. There are nations that use more plastic than us, but recycle most of it, hence have less plastic pollution. 
Setting up recycling centres can be very useful in the long run.  [Make Roads](https://www.thebetterindia.com/43685/plastic-waste-in-road-construction-plastic-man-india-prof-vasudevan/) Firstly, all single use plastics should be totally banned. No plastic in food and beverage packaging. This itself will reduce a huge chunk of waste. In other cases, reusing should be encouraged, and if possible, enforced.  Plastic bags are a blessing to us poor to lower class people. I get a plastic bag when I buy some rice dal, eat rice on it using it as plate. Then take it to a water pipe and when no one is around I fill it with water. I wash my hands face and drink water. I throw it out after that. Some people use them to do latrine since they have blocked the defecation areas due to hybin issue. If the government could subsidize the manufacture of paper bags to the point it becomes cheaper than plastic bags, then we could probably have this problems solved. This would require some work to understand how paper bag can be maufactured at a lower cost. The only way to solve a problem like this is to incentivize the usage of other products. The root cause here is overpopulation. We need to spread out our settlements so that waste management becomes easier. With 10 million people in a city, it doesn't take much individual contribution to create a HUGE amount of waste.  Complete and strict ban on production, sale and usage of plastic. 1. Reduce-reuse-recycle. That's the sequence to manage all kinds of waste including plastics. 
2. Correct segregation of waste is the first step that needs to be taken care  at point of waste creation. 
3. The 3 bin method is the best for household waste. Wet (green waste 50-55% by weight), dry (recyclables 30-35%) and reject (hazardous10%). If waste is segregated at the household level it increases the recyclability, reduces the amount of weight going to the landfill. Green waste can ideally be composted locally.
4. A separate place for discarding e- waste.
5. Many colonies in Gurgaon, Pune and Bangalore are already doing this.

There is less of rocket science and more of plain old method and discipline that we lack in waste management.",Science/Technology,2018-12-05 13:57:51

IT-to-Neuroscience?,7,b4fjxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4fjxb/ittoneuroscience/,0,"Hi, 

Currently I am pursuing PhD in information technology. However, my work is progressing toward neuroscience (which I found as my energy converging point). Currently, I am studying emotions. Due to IT background, I am pretty well with the coding skills and applying it for customised high end GPU based calculations on voxel wise activity given some task. Although, I always have this feeling of lack of sufficient knowledge in the field of neuroscience. Although, I am trying my best to learn as much as possible but missing a disciplinary thinking while facing a complex puzzle. Although, I find myself studying about the neuroscience stuff without any sense of exhaustion, a leap step is needed to get deeply indulged in this exciting and important domain.

As it is a transition period for me where I need to use my relatively more developed computational skills to get the sense and pleasure of getting new in-depth knowledge of the field of brain science. I am seeking for the suitable guideline which can give me a better chance to grab the domain knowledge during this transition and lead me towards disciplinary thinking over more complex problems. I am interested in further studying emotions and related disorders. The guidelines during the PhD and after the PhD both are very much needed and highly appreciated.

"Digital Colonisation: the fight for India's soul, and for the rest of the world, begins with individual privacy online. It's time to fight back against Silicon Valley. But... how?",2,at9hy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/at9hy3/digital_colonisation_the_fight_for_indias_soul/,4,"Next to Aadhaar, Facebook may be the greatest modern threat against privacy. How do we fight back and keep Facebook from colonising India?

> ""The business model of the internet is surveillance. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. [Corporations call it marketing.](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/surveillance_is_the.html)""

Have you noticed? Whenever someone says ""you're being **too political**"", it usually means ""you've mentioned a group of people I don't care about"".

Or **they gaslight you** -- saying you're ""crazy"" for not being white, male, straight, or ""American"" enough. If you dare to notice the discrimination built into their systems, they try to distract from the issue by **attacking you as a person**, trying to force you to jump through endless hoops of arbitrarily defined ""moral purity"".

**This is the typical response on Reddit.** Silicon Valley's social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) was built by them, for them. ""Them"" means entitled middle-class white males. More specifically: _middle-class, white, aged between 18 and 49, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and mostly American_ males. They built social media for themselves and their friends. The rest of us are unwelcome guests in their safe space.

# **Free Speech versus Diversity?**

This is why the rest of us (non-white, women, LGBT, and others) are treated so badly on their systems. They refuse to ban racist, or violent misogyny and homophobia because it would hurt ""free speech"". Their persecution anxiety leads their bigotry behind slogans like ""diversity is the problem"", ""don't shove _your diversity_ in my face"". George Orwell would be proud (or horrified) to see such twisting of words in service of harmfully bad ideas.

> Here's an analogy: nuclear power can be used to power entire cities and give millions of people energy for centuries, or destroy cities and commit genocide in the blink of an eye. Should we allow the secrets and materials for nuclear to proliferate everywhere, because it's ""just science"" and ""knowledge wants to be free""? Of course not.
> 
> Should we allow bigotry and hatred to rule on social media because it's ""just speech"" and ""information wants to be free""? Of course not.

Now you see the bigotry hidden in Silicon Valley talk about ""free speech"". It's free for them, and the costs are left for us to bear. This is the same as patterns of colonisation throughout the history of Western civilisation. History has begun to repeat itself on the internet.

In other words, they have no grasp of basic morality for anyone who isn't like them. And as you'll see here, that means people in India, Brasil and around the world are now starting to die.

## **Aadhaar's Failure is Facebook's Success**

The question here begins with privacy.

Aadhaar is well-known for allowing unauthorised access to [private information of millions of India's citizens](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html). People are concerned, are rightfully so.

In the case of Facebook, selling your privacy to the highest bidder is the entire profit model. That's why Facebook is ""free"". It's as if Aadhaar's privacy-destroying mistakes are Facebook's business plan.

For India, a country where [69% of citizens live in rural areas](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS), this means that over 300 million people (those who have smartphones) are at risk. And unlike the Indian government's dependence on the will of the people, Facebook is completely unaccountable to anyone but their company shareholders.

# **Facebook's Plan to Colonise India**

Starting in 2014, [Facebook tried to give away free Internet to rural India](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-india-doesnt-want-free-basics). The bargain was simple: if you use internet through Facebook, we give it to you for free. That really means, ""if you allow us to watch, record and sell data about every move you make online, we'll give you access to a limited amount of internet for no cost.""

Thankfully, India's regulators eventually said no, and in 2016, the Free Basics program was stopped.

## **Facebook and Bollywood**

If you've watched any Bollywood films over the past few years, there are two names you'll see and hear all the time. You can probably guess. No, it's not SRK or Deepika Padukone. Also not Salman Khan or Katrina Kaif.

The two names are Facebook and WhatsApp.

Again in rural India, WhatsApp has been involved in [an increasing number of murders](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/12/deadly-rumours-india-whatsapp-dilemma-171216091928319.html). The culprit is rumours and intentional misinformation that spread via Facebook's messaging service (WhatsApp).

Even though Facebook's attempts to colonise India are blatant (the Free Basics program) and have led to several deaths (WhatsApp), they are still making more efforts.

Instead of regulators, they are trying to convince citizens that Facebook is good by having celebrities constantly use the service in Bollywood films.

You may not have known this, but Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook. Now think of how many times you've seen films where the real stars in the background are social media accounts on someone's smartphone. (There's even a Reddit community [specifically for Indian people praising Facebook...!](https://np.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/))

# **Democracy, Immigration, Misinformation and Disinformation**

Now think about how easily democracy has been subverted in places like the United States, Britain and Brasil. In the U.S., the Trump campaign openly acknowledged targeting [millions of young women and black voters through Facebook](http://fortune.com/2016/10/30/trump-voter-supression-operations/) to suppress their votes, since they tend to vote Democrat (not Republican; Trump is a Republican). In the case of Brexit, [hundreds of fake Twitter accounts also spread disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/how-400-russia-run-fake-accounts-posted-bogus-brexit-tweets).

As more children and adults in mass detainment centres, the American immigration service (ICE) is [using users' private Facebook data to target and hunt down immigrants](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-facebook-data-track-immigrants).

# **To prevent colonisation of our digital lives, we must fight back for our right to privacy.**

So how can we fight against amoral companies like Facebook (with WhatsApp and Instagram) and Twitter?

We now know that [""free"" access via Internet advertising is just another word for intrusive surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/24/deep-surveillance-is-price-of-a-free-web-advertising). We know that in rural India, where many are less educated, people are dying because of misinformation spread through social media. And we know since 2016, that as long as Facebook and Silicon Valley can get away with it, they don't care.

There needs to be an alternative, and it needs to come from the people who are most affected. Not another Facebook, Orkut, Reddit or Twitter, created by white men, for white men -- and if anyone else wants to join, they'd better not be too ""political"". The web is run by narcissists and bullies now, and there has to be a better way.

I'm working with a project that is creating a new social network, but if this post inspires you to start something for India and the rest of the world, I'd be glad to work with you, too. And if you're just hearing some of these facts for the first time, it's okay to be angry. Get angry enough to do something right now. The stakes are too high now to just shrug, turn away and take another selfie: if we let Silicon Valley take our privacy away, they will never give it back.",nibirujiii," [deleted] the real threat to user privacy is the GoI hare brained schemes (including Aadhar)  which are implemented in a  totally half assed manner  by 'geniuses' like Nandan Nilekani.

In *India* FB is a very distant threat in comparison. You at least have the choice of using/not using FB.

Our Robots (Mitra) Vs Their Robots (Boston Dynamics),121,8z99fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8z99fw/our_robots_mitra_vs_their_robots_boston_dynamics/,95,"Let me preface this by saying that the intention of this post is neither to mock science/engineering/robotics in India, nor to pin the blame on the current government. I am just acknowledging the wide gap. 

Today I woke up to a tweet by IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad which showed a robot called Mitra made by an Indian company. The robot looked amusingly simple, like a bigger version of the toys I had as a child. See it here: 

> Nice to meet Mitra- the robot during Goa IT day that has been developed by an Indian startup. #DigitalIndia

> https://twitter.com/rsprasad/status/1018473949229826048?s=09

I was intrigued and searched for it. I came across this video which shows the same robot greeting Ivanka Trump when she visited India. The robot enters with drumbeats:

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_irZMn5JeB0

The only function this robot could do was roll around with remote control and respond to a simple touch screen press. It kind of failed the second task because the maker did not think the process through (PM and Ivanka both press the button together and it got stuck on the next screen). This is the technology we were showcasing to the world.

On the other hand, we have Boston Dynamics. I remember seeing their Big Dog robot almost a decade back and it had blown my mind back then. See how it corrects itself even after being kicked:

>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gi6Ohnp9x8

They have many incredible robots. Here is their human shaped version:

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY

It can walk on uneven surface, on snow, lift objects...the bastard can get up when knocked over. Their other robots can climb stairs, [open doors](https://youtu.be/fUyU3lKzoio?t=13s) (velociraptor from Jurassic Park?) and even run. Imagine [this guy chasing you](https://youtu.be/wE3fmFTtP9g?t=57s)! 

These guys are building fucking terminators while we are still stuck at creating toys that you can buy at Hamleys :(",kash_if," Theres a lot to unpack here. Technology like that requires SIGNIFICANT research. Which requires funding, infrastructure and most importantly people. We have a significant amount of brain drain where the aspirations of tLehe best and brightest is to go abroad for further research. Colleges in India aren't as  research focused as is required to truly build world class instutions. I studied in an NIT and the MTech students were treated very poorly and had to fight for even the most basic infrastructure.  Mitra was brought to my college. The mechanics, computer vision and the actual neural network all clearly looked terrible. 

It was no more a robot than a shitty little chinese  toy. It moved slowly (on wheels). It was capable of asking pre fed questions. It honestly looked like a remote controlled moving computer screen.

I cannot put into words how tatti it is.

Even trying to compare it to Boston Dynamics and others should be considered offensive. Mitra is not even worthy of being called a fuckin robot. Its a plastic toy. Balaji Vishwanathan, the famous Modi bhakt on Quora is its creator. No wonder they let this piece of plastic showcase in GES Hyderabad. It's embarrassing. Many people have called it out. https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7mf6d7/balaji_vishwanathans_mitra_robot_explained/ 1. There is no such thing as research or serious scholarship in India, barring some arts and humanities departments.

2. Teaching in STEM is a joke. Most professors and PhDs are not qualified to even take very basic introductory courses. It's an absolute shit show

3. Funding is abysmal. Resources are non-existent. Intellectual cultural or environment is absent. All this government cares about is vedic science.

4. Brain drain, yes, everyone with an ounce of potential and opportunity fucks off to abroad, because this country is hopeless. It's run by goons, full of outdated laws, unnecessary bureaucracy, lack of institutions that can foster scientific temperament and facilities.  

You want good things? You want India to be able to do stuff other countries so casually do. Look around you. Look at the poverty, and look at who is governing the country. Then wallow in your disappointment. 

It'll take another 50 years for Indian middle class to grow substantially that your aspirations becomes the aspirations of the average citizen, enough to shake the goon foundation of Indian politics and destroy it. 

Be glad ISRO at least capable of shit.  Mitra is surely not representative of Indian robotics. One of the reasons this robot gets so much attention is the undeniable fact that the founder Balaji Vishwanathan is a famous unapologetic hindutva sympathizer. Self marketing is something he does very well.  

That being said there are some really promising robotic startups that gets limited attention. Check out Grey Orange,  Sastra robotics and Asimov Robotics.  You got the name wrong, the name is not mitra its TATTI The answer is quite simple, India doesn't have money for *stupid* things like Science and Technology. Here is a [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01504-5?referral=true) describing India's abysmal stand over R&D:
> Despite the cash injection, India’s spending on science will remain relatively low, at around 0.8% of gross domestic product (GDP). That is well below the 3% that researchers demanded in August during ‘march for science’ events around the country. “There appears to have been only 8–10% rise in various scientific departments on average, which, factoring in inflation, is not much,” says Krishna Ganesh, founding director of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Tirupati. “Nowhere are we even near 1% of GDP.”

I am doing Masters in USA after doing undergrad (from a reputed institute mentioned in the article) in India and I can see the difference quite well myself. Atmosphere is more conducive, funding is way higher and the most important: people at the top (politicians etc.) actually want to develop and explore Science  than do it just because they are in charge of that portfolio. Mitra is a kids toy at best. For ages 5-9. They can backflip too.
https://youtu.be/fRj34o4hN4I They're not even choosing the right products to show-off. While I admit that no Indian project has ever reached the level of Boston Dynamics we can definitely do something better than Mitra. Thousands of college students in the country are making things like [Mars Rovers](http://urc.marssociety.org/), [Race cars](http://www.formulabharat.com/) and fucking satellites which are more sophisticated than this thing.  Our Indian robot looks like from Jio institute of eminence 😂 I think comparison of Boston Dynamics and Asimov with Mitra bot is little bit flawed because the former have millions of dollars at their disposal and have been working at this field for a long time. 

But I will agree with this part- Mitra bot is literally a toy that could be found in Hamleys. It is nothing but a shining example of doorways that bootlicking and shilling can achieve. I think this comparison is completely stupid. Mitra as Balaji explained it is a robot  focussing for communication and entertainment. This is new and they are building things from scratch. 

Boston dynamics work on maneuvering, and train on different terrains, and are trained to handle complex motor tasks.

A robot specializing for communication can actually look like a toy or r2d2, and will have good time with families, elderly and the ill. 

A robot specializing for locomotion like a biped, quadriped is out to beat the shit of terrorists and has no business in entertainment.

Now, there is not a huge gulf of quality in communication robots. What separates different communication robots is actually motor skills, which is not in their niche but an extra random feature. Like old companies like Honda has.

People using a communication robot to innaugrate a function, why is there any problem in that ? Somebody had an idea, they gave it to Mitra team, they executed it, as per their capacity. If some institute wants to say that they have built better robots in this niche, they should actively look to grab these opportunities. 
 
Anybody who works in NLP and deep learning knows how merky these things are, and how apple-orange comparison is this. 
 I don't expect anything less from Balaji Vishwanathan I am going to make a human shaped Amazon Alexa and name it 'Mitron'. We are soon going to have our very own Real steel matches.
This is development for sure. I don't know much about Mitra , as far as I know its more focused on NLP and this is just a prototype. Comparing it to Boston dynamics is funny, as both of them target different industries.   
While boston dynamic focus on robotic manoeuvring, localisation and better control dynamics, Mitra doesn't intend to compete it.  


FYI , before bashing anyone just google Greyorange (clients include Amazon, HUL and so on) , Arav UAV ( built the whole flight controller and image processing engine from scratch ).   


Please upgrade your knowledge about robotics first, secondly there are many other companies under the hood doing good job. You certainly lack good research.   
 Yes its not like they're based out of a country with a significant higher GDP, much better academic infrastructure and a more conducive research and business environment or anything. Different budgets, different things they are going for, different use cases.

When that company gets 200 million dollars to burn. They will make something like boston dynamics.

**Childhood in my Hood, Spider-Man and INS DEGA**

As you can see, I am from Vizag. I was brought up and still live in the middle of an Industrial-Estate. My entire childhood revolved around [all sort of machines]( https://imgur.com/a/EdN3Xvj), machinery and welding sparks coming from the never ending fabrication works that went on in the hood. This sort of environment made me a naturally curious kid thanks to my dad and Uncle who both hold a Diploma in Mechanical Engineer for choosing the right neighbourhood. All my questions regarding these machines were nicely answered by my father and that in turn made me more interested in how things worked. This got a boost when I first met [*Spider-Man* and his amazing friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0FJNBRP8P0). This show and other Sider-Man shows had a huge impact on me, so much so that I used to play with common house spiders in hopes that its bite would turn me into a Spider-Man. Thanks to Universe, venomous spiders are not that common in a typical Urban Indian household I guess, I’m still alive and well. Besides that stupidity, Spider-Man being a student of science and using science to solve problems or for fighting villains made me interested in sciences and I started to pay attention in classes and made me question and think about things in universe and nature. This helped me have good foundation in Maths and General Sciences. 

On the other hand, our neighbourhood is in the close vicinity of a Naval Airport, INS DEGA. This helped me develop a love for things that fly. Our Neighbourhood used to be perfectly aligned with the runway path of the airport, this gave me really up close view of the planes touching down and taking off of the airport. Being a Defense airport there were special aircrafts in addition to the commercial ones. Navy Week was and still is the best season for some flight watching. At the age of 11, this interest in flying things pushed me to apply the science I learnt in school to make an object that fly with the help of DC motors it failed, of course. But that failure has set the path which I would follow in my higher studies. My father introduced me to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam who has been a huge inspiration. I may not know the name of the degree but I decided to study the science of flight and how to build things that fly. That was the idea of a child. 

**Finding an admission for Undergrad, IITM- Shaastra 07 & 08, Job Hunt & Masters in UK**

I was good theoretically but competitive exams are not my thing. I knew, I wouldn’t succeed neither in JEE nor AIEEE so any dreams of doing Aerospace/Aeronautical Engineering were smashed, my parents are kind enough to not force me into that machinery and left me to my choice for EAMCET. I just have to get a Mechanical Engineering seat in Andhra University or GITAM. That’s good enough for me because, Mechanical engineering also covers the science of flight and these two are the best engineering schools of my city and I don’t have to leave town if got an admit. 

So I found myself in GITAM, it has been a fun ride there. I always loved hands on jobs since I am a kid. I love to build something or do something with my hands. In second year of undergrad I attended Shaastra’ 07 at IIT MADRAS and it changed my outlook on engineering as a whole. I was awed by the students who built and gave a demo of the [VTOL flight built by them, Team YU-FLY?]( https://imgur.com/a/jj7DiUk) It was the coolest thing I saw. It was when I started taking an interest in research and technological developments in my field and in general. Target was set to Shaastra 08, me and my childhood friends made a contraption built by our own hands using a lot of Jugaad and tools found from the hood. Have a look here [GIF 1]( https://gfycat.com/KnobbyCompetentBear), [GIF 2]( https://gfycat.com/ImperturbableDefenselessIberianmidwifetoad). That was the demo video we sent in with the abstract. We are the Mighty mavericks but we got of Lots of weak links in the plan and it worked only partially. This set the stage for my participation in a series of technical events that I would attend over the last two years of my Undergrad. 

My communication skills were really bad by the end of Undergrad and this meant I wasn’t doing good in the Campus Interviews. I only wanted to join a core company and I couldn’t find any. I did the 5 day assessment for technical engineer post in IAF but didn’t make that list too. Couldn’t get a good rank in GATE. But found myself an admission at a really good Mechanical Engineering School in UK. Education Loan was the only way I could afford this and my parents had to put our house on the line to get a loan. EDWISE has given me immigration support free of cost as I secured my own admission. Went to UK and finished my degree, visited London twice and returned home. That’s it. I did not make much contact with the life in UK, its land and its culture. I was limited by time and money. But with the help of High-speed internet, I did learn a lot about world, science and technology, history and was introduced to reddit, student guilds, game of thrones and a whole lot of popular culture through university life. This helped with my English and subsequently my communication skills.

**Shock after returning home**

After finishing the degree, I returned home only to find that the degree I just received is not valid in India. Even a private engineering college didn’t want to hire me as a lecturer because my degree is not considered a Master’s Degree. That was a huge blow to me. I had to look for opportunities abroad again. Thanks to my thesis supervisor in UK, a well-known name in his field, gave me a good recommendation letter which helped me secure a full scholarship to do doctoral research in Australia. I was so happy and my parents were really proud of me.

**My way Down Under and How life changed there: RA Job, Research and Cooking**

I never thought I’d end up in Australia of all places. I went there with no expectations and the first few months have been the most difficult months. Then I made friends at student housing, who pushed me to apply for RA position and that changed a lot of things. I got the position and during my term I would be promoted to a senior RA and would organize the best parties and events over the next couple of years. This gave me a huge exposure to Aussie, International students and cultures from around the world. I had to be outgoing for the job so I became an outgoing person. [My love for cooking, adventure, camping and off road driving]( https://imgur.com/a/w6k2kIk) helped me go to some of the remote parts of Australia and make some amazing friends along the way. People around me at uni and housing were mostly younger than me, were not judgemental at all and I could do what I want without fear of judgement. I was earning good money while having the best time of my life and cleared my education loan in no time. [Perfect song to describe my time down under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpjvJdomfM) 

My research on the other hand was not going as expected. I am a hands-on person and I always enjoyed experimental work rather than simulations or numerical work. My research problem has been changed by supervisor from being heavily based on experiments to one that was half cooked right from the beginning which consisted mostly of Numerical work and only some namesake validation by experimental work. On top of that one of supervisor who is supposed to help me with Numerical work has moved to another university in another country all together and I was left with a supervisor who is Experimental guy guiding me on numerical work. From there it was a downward spiral and I ended up losing interest in the research I was doing. I produced two papers which in my opinion are not really great. 

On a parallel, I was doing really well as a RA, was cooking and trying some amazing recipes to whole lot of people from around the world and at one point [I cooked Indian food entirely made from scratch for the entire student village of 300 students](https://imgur.com/a/NqswIa9). Since I was a kid, I loved cooking and it was a life-long dream to own a restaurant someday and this idea was there in the back of my head all the time. And when it came to point where I can no longer continue my research work due to various reasons and I had to make a decision to change my line of work. It wasn’t easy, I had to consider so many things into account and had to find the confidence that I can cook commercially. 

**First Job in a Commercial Kitchen and How I found myself in a Road trip**

So I went searching for a job in a commercial Kitchen. After a lot of failed attempts, I went door to door along a popular coffee strip giving out [my new culinary resume](https://imgur.com/a/xVMIt9s) which I had to make up using the things I did so far. I got a call back from a Chef who loved my resume, my passion for the craft of cooking and gave me a job in his kitchen. Being the only computer literate among the staff I got to know the ropes of making stock lists, recipe cards, the numbers behind making a menu and running a commercial kitchen basically /r/kitchenconfidential. This gave me the confidence I needed. 

I rented a big motorcycle above 700CC which I always wanted to drive and just left for a drive. I covered 1400 KM in next two days along the southwest corner of Australia. This journey gave me the opportunity be with myself, think about myself and helped me come to a decision on so many things I wanted to do in life. The trip was really dangerous, I was driving 130-120 KMPH because I only rented the bike for two days and wanted to make the most out of it, I cannot lose sight of the road ahead because if I hit a kangaroo or things crossing the roads I’d crash at high speed and before I know it I’d be dead as Australia being so huge it would take hours for someone to notice me or get me to help. This fear for life made me so vigilant, self-aware and made me concentrate on the road like I never did before and that too hours on end. I was a different person at the end of this trip. I am not even exaggerating on this one. I felt like I conquered all my fears in life.

It was clear to me; I just had to do what makes me happy. I quit my research, quit the job in the kitchen and was finally on my way back home with the most daunting task ahead,  telling my parents about it, convincing them to help me start a Food Truck and to believe in my dream. After all is said and done, they still don’t get why I am doing this but decided to support my cause. 

**My Friend**

I could not do this alone; I needed a partner to do this with. The first person I got in mind was my lifelong friend. We went to same school since kindergarten and grew up together in the same neighbourhood and in a way we see thing uniquely in our own ways. He was not a brilliant student in class but he was the best when it comes to real world, he is creative, he can see things which no one else can in places nobody else even looks. He is brave and always helped me with my phobia for dogs; he has been a huge support in my life. I spoke to him regarding this and he immediately wanted to join me. He quit his job in Mumbai and came back to our city. He has his share of troubles at home, more than me and for that I really admire him for believing in my dream and to make this decision to join me on this journey.  

**Straight Outta Vizag**
	
I named our little venture Straight Outta Vizag because I truly believe this city has shaped my life so much, in a way it defines me and for that I love my city like how Peter Parker loves his city, New York. Although we are not the webbed vigilante we too try to do some good in our city. For our first socio-event, thanks to my sister and Good Universe, a NGO, [we organised an awareness campaign on women’s health in our neighbourhood](https://imgur.com/a/uKaRy2d) and it was a grand success. 

We started operations with this [Menu](https://imgur.com/a/WIlbGXU) and was getting a  good response. Then, Kerala floods happened so we decided to donate our earnings during this run towards the Kerala flood relief activities as you can see from our post history.

**Cold hands of the City governing bodies**

No matter how good our intentions are, we are not welcomed in the city. Before going on road, we went to various government offices like, Food safety and standards, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation- GVMC and its Public Health wing, City Police and Fire Department to get permission according to this [Notification by Hyderabad City Police](http://www.ctp.gov.in/PressNote/NotificationFoodCourtVehiclePermission.pdf), I found online. It appears so that, none of the people I met have no idea if such a regulation existed in my City, Vizag. No one official has given us direction with this regard. No one has responded to us properly, most of the people claim that no one has come to them like us, asking permission to put up a food truck and that they won’t allow it, mostly because they haven’t done that before. But there are lot of food trucks running in the city. 

[I submitted a letter to the Commissioner, GVMC]( https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) in May but got no response even after all these months so we started operations with only a FSSAI license in hand. Where ever we go Police or the GVMC personnel has asked us to remove the truck. Why are other trucks allowed then? Later I learned that other food truck people formed into Unions area-wise and are running things according to their made up rules within the area like a “dhandha”. Why do I have to join a union of a particular place or all the places if I intend to set-up my truck?

**More Social Activism**

During the month of August 2018, we had rains for a couple of days and our street got flooded due to improper storm drains. We have had this issue for ages and our colony people have approached the municipality but nothing was done. In lieu of this, we brought it to the notice of [GVMC commissioner through an open letter](https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) on our facebook and twitter profiles, which talks not just about our problems in the hood but also other problems that I have seen in my city. This time we got a response but I did not mention my problems with the permits because it didn’t seem right to plug the same with problems in the hood and my city. 

GVMC responded promptly and started the restoration of storm drain works in September and finished the work during the second week of November. Due to these works happening we had to put a comma to our operations and resumed our work during third week of November. 

**What happened after we are back on road…**

This time we wanted to try a healthy breakfast menu and we set up shop on the way between VUDA Park and YSR statue Roundabout on the beach road. We were asked to vacate the place by an Assistant City Planning officer from GVMC Zone II. The next day we moved to parking in front of YMCA on beach road and two days later, this time, a sanitation inspector warns us not to put up the truck and it will be seized if we do so again. So we removed the truck and went to meet the GVMC Zone-II commissioner, Mr. Palli Nallanayya. Here’s how our interaction went by: 

Me n My friend walk into commissioner’s room who appeared to be in a staff meeting. 

Me – ‘trying to hand him the letter we already submitted to GVMC’-- utters the words: “Sir, memu food truck okati start chesam mee...” “Sir, we are starting a food truck…”
He cut me off there and with a growing frown on his face he just utters the word “ivvamu”... “Alantivi ivvamu ma zone Lo” “Stop it there, we will not give you a permit. We don’t do this sort of thing in our Zone.”

Looking at his body language and the way he didn’t even bother to hear what we have to say made me sick and we left the room. 

Because of these obstacles we are now without a proper location for our truck. Many have suggested me ways to get a contact in GVMC who knows “how to get things done” But I do not want to go that route because it is not the right way to do it and as stupid as I am I will fight for what is right and we are planning to meet the commissioner regarding this and File a RTI with GVMC and City Police regarding what they know about already existing food trucks. Meanwhile, we found some gigs with adventure agencies and started arranging food for trekking and camping events in our beautiful and untapped eastern ghats.  We also cater to small parties, family gatherings, speciality events, college get-togethers and many more. We met some amazing people along the way, particularly youngsters who seem to respect and admire what we are trying to do which in turn gave us energy to continue on our journey. We intend to bring cooking and the joy of making food closer to our patrons and give them a well-rounded dining experience wherever they choose to eat.  

Our city has so much to offer in terms of tourism. Our tourism potential is not fully tapped into and we want to promote our city tourism which will help create jobs in the local communities. I cordially invite any and all off you folks that love a good beach or a view from a hill, come visit our city, Vizag. If you choose to hire us we can take you around and accompany you with good food and present you with some amazing views that are unique to our city and it’s geography. As the songs goes...

I’m sharing this with the reddit community because it is a unique platform compared to other social networking sites and the people, stories from reddit have inspired me a lot and helped me develop as person. And by sharing this I would like inform the community about us and hope that our story may inspire someone else in realizing their own dreams. Also, to reach out to a lot of people who barely know about our City in terms of a travel destination and to reach out artists, content creators, travel bloggers and to collaborate with anyone who is interested in enjoying good food and nature. Do have a look at us, know about us and if possible inform your friends about us. See you on the road.

Organisations like silverzone and SOF are ruining the prestige of olympiads in India.,189,8r87e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8r87e7/organisations_like_silverzone_and_sof_are_ruining/,53,"As most of you DO NOT know, there are 6 major olympiads organised for school students (there are 12 major science olympiads, but these 6 offer the most incentives).

These are->

1) International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)

2) International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)

3) International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)

4) International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO)

5) International Astronomy Olympiad (IAO)

6) International Olympiad of Linguistics (IOL)

All of these are extremely prestigious olympiads, which one can not take part in directly. They have various stages in which they sieve out children, and in the end a team of 4-6 children represents a country in these international olympiads. Olympiads organised by silverzone/SOF are misdirecting people into a false sense of prestige, and are making big bucks doing so. They sell admit cards, workbooks, text books, past year papers and whatnot. They even go as far as to copy the names of these olympiads exactly as they are.

Here's an incident: A friend of mine is an IMO bronze medallist, and he shared this fact one day with his relatives. His aunt was quick to respond that her daughter was in fact a gold medal holder in IMO. When he asked which year was the IMO, and where it was held, she told him that the olympiad took place in her daughter's school just a week ago. Here's the kicker, the real IMO has never taken place in India since its inception, and only 11 people in India have won a gold medal.

Just wanted to let out this quick rant. Dont waste your money on these hoax olympiads, and then go on and brag about how your child is a gold medal holder.

A few colleges in India offer admission on the basis of participation in these olympiads, and I was shocked when people from silverzone/SOF olympiads were lining up to claim their seats. Needless to say, they all got rejected, but what was even sadder is that they did not even know about the big 6 olympiads.

If you have been selected into the training camp of any of these 6 olympiads, you can get admission to Chennai Mathematical Institute(one of the best mathematics school in india) and IIIT-H(International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad). You are also selected for an interview at ISI(Indian Statistical Institute) if you have been a member of IMO-TC(training camp for IMO). These are some of the incentives to participate in these olympiads.

EDIT: correction, IMO was held in India once in 1996

EDIT2: India actually participates in almost all the major olympiads.",thescoobynooby," Is it possible to enter Olympiads without being affiliated with a school? I was probably twice a bronze medallist in one of those SOF olympiads, science one - district level, sad to know all this. Also, anyone took the ASSET exam ? I still have that card with me Maybe I am in the minority, but as far I have seen, a good number of serious candidates actually know about the big 6 and the pointlessness of SOF Olympiads. At the very least, such serious kids also score well in NTSE/KVPY and other prestigious exams.

But it is indeed a sad state of affair that a lot of people haven't even *heard* of these. Two of my classmates gave the state qualifiers and went till the national camp but couldn't make it into the International tournament. I have given one of those fake ass IMO in my school where it is completely subjective with questions coming from the NCERT books. It completely felt like giving Pre-boards. 
  And at beginners level, if you want your kids to participate in any such olympiads (other than the big six), please avoid silver zone, SOF and eduheal. Go for unified council olympiads instead. They are somewhat better. And their BMA workbooks are far superior than the SOF workbooks. 

The big six can get very tough. I tried preparing for RMO but gave up in the preparation stage. It was hard for me. 

So please don’t force your kids to do that if they don’t have the aptitude. 

Also look for the government scholarship tests, they are reputable and prestigious and can give you an edge in admissions/jobs. Like NTSE, KVPY etc.  >Here's the kicker, the real IMO has never taken place in India since its inception, and only 11 people in India have won a gold medal.

Correction, [It has, in 1996.](https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=1996) Woah dude, your friend is a legend for getting a bronze in IMO. There was a Change.org petition which wanted to force these organizations to drop the word Olympiad from their name so as to preserve the name.


Also, slight clarification, India does participate in IPO and IESO (Philosophy and Earth Science). And IOL is just International Linguistics Olympiad. IMO took place in India in 1996 I believe !  Do you have any reliable resources regarding the big six Vs SOF?

I'm asking because my old school is a regular participant of the SOF Olympiads (heck, I came third in their English one. )

I could send that info to them so they could reconsider supporting them.  You forgot the junior Olympiads : IJSO and IOAA (Junior science and junior astronomy Olympiads).  You also missed the [International Biology Olympiad (IBO)](http://www.ibo-info.org/). India hosted the IBO in 2008, at HBCSE, Mumbai.

Until about 2010-11, students who represented India at any of the ""hard science"" olympiads could get admission into the IISERs. IIRC, they stopped Olympiad-stream admissions around the same time the IISERs got their own entrance test.  I'd say IMSc tops CMI (studied there), but its still a really close call. JEE destroyed India's potential in the International olympiads.",Science/Technology,2018-06-15 12:24:05
Short concise interactive books for college students. Indian education system in bad shape.,7,9xldhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9xldhp/short_concise_interactive_books_for_college/,9,"I am a computer science college student from India. I found that students always complain about the education system, the poor quality of teachers and teaching methods (and I am one among them, it's awful in India at least) . At the same time some teachers also complain that students don't do any self study at all. They are always looking for shortcuts, like reading an article or some videos here and there to pass the exams .

If we think from the student point of view, it's very difficult for them to read books and get in-depth knowledge for so many subjects every semester at the same time following your passion (which is most of the time , unrelated to the courses they are taking) and taking part in extra curricular activities at college, learning cool technologies to become job ready. Hence it's actually not possible for them to sit down and read through 500 pages books for each subject, do assignments honestly .

I have an idea to solve this problem. If we can develop short (around 100 pages) books for every subject , which are interesting to read and at the same time give students a overall view of the subject to pass the exam. This will help them get a complete picture rather than the fragmented knowledge they get from internet , which is mostly pointless. Through a collaborative platform online , we can get this book developed by the best people in the community and make it available for everyone to read for free.

This is my idea in very brief, I would love to know your opinions and indulge in further discussion if anyone is interested.",udit003," > the fragmented knowledge they get from internet , which is mostly pointless.

Gone are the days when you could curl up with a yashwant kanetkar C++ book and feel intelligent by proxy. Learning now has to be more chaotic - going back and forth between hands-on trials and theory. Who would want to begin with syntax and shit every single time.

I don't think an offline hard copy is feasible for as fluid a field as computer science. Textbooks are a racket even in USA.

Besides, computer Science and programming is not like physics or chemistry or biology where you can really benefit from a book. In those areas, the information is much more established and unchanging (or slowly changing).

HeadFirst series of books present info in an interesting way. But it can appear childish after 1 book. An online wiki is much more helpful. Or an ebook.  Education has to evolve, like any other field. Indian education system is still somewhere in the 70's. Absolute disregard for technology and still relying on dictation+ rote learning instead of providing a platform for students to develop their own individual skillsets. 

Trying to change it from within is quite futile. I'd say get out on time, do your 5 years of boring company work, then if you still feel strongly about it, innovate. Your current idea is very shortsighted, kind of a means to an end, which is what the industry terms ""a hack"".  You are relying on a non-existent community to collaborate and contribute to something, for which they have no motivation or incentive. 

Why not start a class forum or maybe a discord/slack group instead? Create a community on that, and let it grow over a semester. Recruit the people who are active there and think of a better solution. Sounds intriguing but hardly anything worthwhile can be covered in 100 pages, it won't be any different from a really good set of notes. The best books/teachers in my opinion explore the basics very deeply, they explore the shortcomings of previous theorems/algorithms/models leading to advanced theorems/algorithms/models.

Your qualms with the education system do hold true but don't just worry about clearing exams, find a subject area you are really interested in, explore and build an expertise around that.

If you could create a community driven platform where subject experts agree to mentor people looking for in-depth knowledge, that will be more valuable.",Science/Technology,2018-11-16 19:29:18
I hate summers!,9,9c4cu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9c4cu9/i_hate_summers/,21,"Disclaimer: My previous post was removed, reason looked more like an excuse and my appeal wasn't answered. Here I'm posting it again. It's about climate i promise, nations are included as relevance and examples for my arguments, not for personal attacks.
My previous [post is archived here.] (https://www.scribd.com/document/387542089/Enjoying-summers-Me-too-s)

I'm from Northern part of India, this little state once upon a time called as breadbasket of India, you guessed it, Punjab.  It might have lost its charm over the years but it's still one of the best place to live in India except one thing: The weather.  

I loathe the weather here, leave aside the first 4 weeks, it's literally a swamp for rest of the year, unbearably hot and humid. As a kid who grew up in Amritsar, I remember when i used to play in the fields outside my house in the monsoons, The fields are covered in concrete now. 

Fast-forward to today, I'm now an adult aged 19. My body has gained mass and stature of a man but what it hasn't gained is Mr. Freeze's Freeze-Ray to keep my cerebral cortex cool. Unless you stay inside an air-conditioned environment or wear some alien OptiTemp suit, you can't stop the heat from bogging down your cognitive functions. It's a fact!

Peak of human Intelligence seldom can be achieved in hot humid climates hence the IQ disparity between the inhabitants of temperate and tropical regions. 

Almost all developed nations are in the temperate zone barring Russia and North Korea (due to decades of Communist mismanagement). Tropical regions are mostly poor except for Bangalore-sized tiny nations like Abu Dhabi (Oil), Singapore (strategic sea hub location) etc.

If you compare within countries in the temperate zone, there's an intellectual divide between their northern and southern regions. Take Italy for example, Southern Italy is comparatively more corrupt and poor than Northern Italy. As such there's a clear correlation between climate and intelligence. This holds true for USA and Japan too. These are wealthy nations who can afford to run AC 24x7.

According to the Cold Winter theory by Richard Lynn,  Ancestors of Europeans and North-East Asians faced extreme winters thus higher intelligence would've evolved and those who didn't develop intellect, perished. Going by this, Eskimos should have the highest IQ on Earth which isn't the case but wait, the author has something to say about it.

    ""Lynn  (CWT, p. 144)  argued that high intelligence can  only  
    evolve in  large populations because mutations, being chance 
    events, are more  likely to occur in large populations. Arctic
    people have smaller  populations than Asians or Europeans and
    therefore mutations beneficial to intelligence did not occur.""

Well, intelligence is a complex topic and it is influenced by host of factors like genetics, culture, birth environment etc. Cold weather is beneficial for brain and yields the easiest intelligence boost without winning a genetic lottery. 

The energy required for cooling human body is greater than warming it up. Also, the brain guzzle up to 20% of total energy, since glucose is also used to regulate temperature of the brain in hot weather, less is spared for the process of cognition.

The people who ruled India for almost 200 years, the mighty British have been living on an Island where yearly day temperature is half that of India, 15C vs 31C. UV Radiation is also quite low and so is the scorching sunlight hours. Contrary to popular belief, dark winters don't cause depression. 

[For science]
Okay, these smartypants from the north aren't heatproof. Consider this scenario. If we were to put some of them on an isolated place without education, knowledge and access to any human technology in existence. Only children can be perfect subjects, So thousands of 5 to 12 years old on a big island (or a continent perhaps) in middle of the equator. They'll  explicit the same behavioral tendency of any equatorial human in the first generation itself, angry, lazy and unproductive. They'll procreate, form languages and religions, adapt to hot humid weather, they'll be too busy killing bugs and sheltering from heat, no energy for intellectual reasoning. 500-2000 years have gone by, their IQ has plummeted to new depths. It's now more comparable to Congolese. Several millennia has passed, their skin now exhibits more melanin than ever to protect them from sun. Suddenly one day, A big ship landed on their shore.

""Terra nullius? ^spots ^a ^man  Hello primitive folks! Wassup? Oh god it's so hot in here! Ah! Sunscreen in a jar of honey, you slaves gonna make me money!""

Enough, The rich northern countries are one who are more worried about the climate change, maybe they might invent some artificial clouds or climate alternation tech once it start becoming unbearable there. The way things are moving now, inhabitability of Indo-gangetic plains in my lifetime is evident.

> The Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GEOMIP) recently looked at how solar alterations might affect regional climate patterns. It concluded that the tropics would be over-cooled and the poles under-cooled.  

Well, Earth doesn't really care what you do to it, it recovered fine after dinosaurs were made extinct  by an asteroid. [This 68,000 square kilometer of lake was made dry by the Soviet government] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea), bigger than Punjab in surface area.

If we take calculated risks, we can surely have a livable Earth without tropics.

Im 21 and I feel like at this age I should start reading books that really help me gain knowledge and broaden my perspective. so can you let me know about some of your favourite non fiction books?. ( I'm really not into biographies but everything else is fine)

I have a special interest in psychology and philosophy so any suggestions on those would be great but I'm open to all other topics as well.

Edit: since I've been getting great responses I am also into biology and technology and  evolutionary science.",artemis268," Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari
The best book I ever read, find the audio book is possible Try Marcus Aurelius's Meditations it's an amazing book. If you want to start with a light read you could start with Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Also checkout r/books.  You might find the book. ""**You Are Not So Smart**"" interesting. It's about the common mistakes we make in assuming things daily. It deals with the psychology of some of the biases we have, and is very easy to read. 

Keep in mind that although very interesting it's also at a very basic level. It should be your beginner's book to understanding common psychology, and not one to make you an expert.  Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond; The Tipping Point; Design of Everyday Things; The Intelligent Investor; The Story of Philosophy; Freakonomics; The Goal; The God Illusion; The Third Chimpanzee; anything by Noam Chomsky; 

Don't give up fiction entirely. Quality fiction and poetry can also help us grow and mature. Try books by Desmond Morris. An anthropologist's view on human behaviour. Some of my favorites -

[p] how the hell did china end up with an extremely pro science government and india with an anti science government?,307,6nztwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6nztwo/p_how_the_hell_did_china_end_up_with_an_extremely/,351,"i just finished reading an article on chinese governments push on Artificial Intelligence. They are about to spend $8B as compared to US's $20.7B. China is ordering its top universities to create courses based around AI and has asked their tech firms to work with govt and develop AI startups and technology.       



How is china busy with developing modern medicines, vaccines, supercomputers and india is wasting time with gomutra/ayurveda etc?       




i keep seeing articles on madhya pradesh hospitals creating astrology based medical consulting, government promoting ayurveda, gomutra or intellectuals in our top universities talking about how ancient india already had created everything etc.      



Will india ever catch up with china on scientific breakthroughs and research? Will our leaders ever take a pro-science stance and create massive machine learning/AI laboratories or breakthroughs in Biotech/modern medicines like china is doing? or will we keep orbiting around our ancient scriptures and hopelessly keep watching as US/EU/CHN/JAP lead this world by researching and creating all the new technologies that we use?         



edit: pardon my incoherent ranting as i am feeling very frustrated after realizing there is hardly any world class research going on in my country while the important powers seem to be marching ahead ",noelgallagherisgod," Forget China. Here in TN I can't even argue with guys who are engineering graduates. Idiots considering anything Science as Western conspiracy. Now they have learned a new term called Illuminati. Even providing facts we can't argue with them. A few days back a stupid guy was claiming everything as Illuminati and Toothpaste cause mouth cancer. That video even went viral. Well one thing to consider is that almost all the top leaders in China are engineers by profession, in India the pre dominant profession of the leader is party worker or lawyer. Cultural revolution. The Mao purges destroyed the previous intellegensia. The people who held on to cultural traditions and religious practices were more or less wiped out. This virtually annihilated most anti-science bastions across China. Initially it stagnated the economy and society but overtime after Mao's death new intellectuals not tied to religion or tradition emerged. It was like the Enlightenment except on a smaller scale. The Chinese learnt their lesson from the purges and coupled with the lessons over the refusal of the Manchu's in the 19 th Century from adopting western tech, the current atmosphere in intellectual pursuits in China is more or less adapt or die. You can make fun of all the copy carting Chinese industries try to do, but it does actually do a fair amount to encourage innovation. That is the R&D departments get to fiddle with new stuff. I genuinely believe that modern copyright laws are impeding development of new tech, thus when the Chinese copy western tech they are able to learn new stuff reverse engineer and eventually make something new. I think the main difference is single party rule in China. This allows them to work on long term goals spanning decades.

In India any govt hv to balance popular move for next elections with long term goals. Off late the short term goals are getting more and more priority over the long term ones So many hyperbole answers. 

China is communist country and by principle religion is not important. (Marx's famous -Religion is opium of masses' anyone?)

75% population don't subscribe to any religion in china.

Source 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_China

Now that religion is not important and out of government, science will definitely flourish. 
 Priority. I am not talking about the priority based on each of their ideology, but, Chinese government is not worried about election or opposition. But since, India is a democracy the most important priority for any party is to keep the votes in tact. If Government spends 8B$ on research and development, how many votes do you think the party is going to get ? But instead if they do some jumla like writing of farmer's loan or something populist, that will make them more popular.

Ayurveda, Gomutra, Ancient India myths are all jumlas to secure the nationalist votes! 

 I think it's because of religion. China is largely [atheist.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_China) Who needs science when everything is written in scriptures? Communism denigrates religion as just another 'opium for the masses' and as such any sort of pandering to superstition or tradition is ruthlessly stamped out where it might actually affect the country's economy or real-world progress in any way.

In order to be a Party member of good standing you pretty much have to be atheist and openly so. Any hint of belonging to any religion will be considered a black mark and will be a problem in everything from job interviews to applying for loans. In such an environment being rational and scientific is possible. If someone in China suggests doing research to see if rhino horn actually is an aphrodisiac they will be laughed at.

Unfortunately we have an uneducated chaiwala who saw fit to name a 10th pass actress as Minister for Education and put a priest on the CM's chair of our most populous state. All of these recent outbreaks of gau-love are simply people who hope that pandering to these people will get them noticed and promoted in the party hierarchy. Unpopular opinion. I think our government is pro science. But our research system is highly awful, it works on generating journal papers after papers. The science grants doesn't demand a definitive result, and most of the time its just research for the sake of research. Our system works on the number of journal articles, not the quality and result oriented research is almost absent. Don't forget you all went to schools in India and were taught math and science, not witchcraft.  >i keep seeing articles on madhya pradesh hospitals creating astrology based medical consulting

This was fake news.

 You're calling a government ""anti-science"" that has:

- doubled ISRO funding

- explicitly sought to make R&D cooperation across the board a major priority in foreign policy (Israel, Germany, etc.)

- invested public money in tech-based start ups 

- increased funding for unis' R&D

- gone out of its way to woo tech manufacturing (to the point of even bothering to sit down and attempting to negotiate a special tax deal with Apple. Yes I know it didn't work out.)

- etc.

If you want to focus on a few just bizarre clickbaity articles about gaumutra or whatever, that's on you. But let's not let our biases delude the facts. We have a conservative right wing government in the centre which has the urgency to say, ""Hindus have mentioned about those scientific investments in Upanishads/Vedas"", after every scientific inventions or discoveries. This government wants to give scientific flavour to its religion, so that they wouldn't have inferiority complex for the stupid things they do in the name of religion. Everyone knows cow is just another animal, but stupids here say it exhales oxygen, trying to give it a scientific flavour. We are doomed. The Chinese are probably in middle of building spaceship parts to reach Alpha Centauri and achieve Science Victory. 
/civ5 Chinese govt is not that much pro science. investing in science does not get you votes. Investing in distractions (religious dogma, frothy nationalism, muslim hate, dalit subjugation...) gets you votes.  Two words: Illiterate Ministers. Atheism and thus science is better accepted in China. While religion and science can co-exist, typically it's easier when a country is non-religious culturally and socially, and thus politically as well. Indian doesnt have any resources or talent for pursuing engineering research at any university except for a couple of IITs. With no money comes no scientific development. Engineers at low tier universities like DU or MU are not even aware of the fact the engineering is about research and technical development and not just to get a IT job at consulting companies.

Defense research by DRDO is also being pulled back by babus just so that they can earn a commission from importing weapons from Russia (some boforce scam) or Israel (semi automatic weapons for the army) when drdo is perfectly capable of developing and has developed fully automatic rifles.

When it comes to low cost medical operations, India is leading the frontier but india is still far behind when it comes to cutting edges medical research and drug development again due to patent laws and lack of funds. It's not that China is pro science or India is anti Science.Even in China,If you get to know the people who are living over there,I'm afraid one might hear a different story than what is generally being projected.I'm not trying to diminish the endeavours of the chinese scientists in any way but being a big country that china is and the restrictions and impositions that it holds its citizens to,I wont be surprised if such a country invests such huge amounts for development in some rewarding fields,be it for the benefit of the humanity or for its selfish purposes.Recent death of a nobel laureate,Liu Xiaobo is more pressing an example of how materialistic a government China has and how uncompromising and stubborn it acts towards anyone who might've acted against the government.

Its not just in AI research. China is also taking steps to make everything environmentally friendly  and is a leading pioneer in quantum computing research.Chinese scientists do deserve a hell lot of praise for the work they're doing in these fields but at the same time  they're(along with everyone else) giving off their rights and everything in order to do so.It's like China is that sweet spot in between a dictatorship nation that is North Korea and the rest of the world.Or may be its a bit more leaning towards the former ,but the difference is too little to notice.

Might be wrong but thats my understanding of China from things I've observed.Been curious about everything China ever since I heard of their successful implementation of population control measures and their support for scientific research.Was quite fond of it too at the beginning.But with censorship,mandatory ""nationalism"",rot in hell cause you said the government sucks - Nah man,lets joke about scrodinger's bhai. Before you get a pro-science government, you need a pro-science population.   
  
Science education in India sucks.  
Who teaches science in the schools and colleges in India? Mostly people who could not manage to do anything.  
China on the other hand, pays PhDs (from the US and Europe) silicon valley level absolute wages to teach their students.  
   
Even on r/india/, with a more educated sample, there are almost no  posts even remotely related to science/application of science to policy/etc.   
The only time we are interested in science is when it comes to bragging and feeling good about it. (ISRO launched 100 satellites! India is Great!)  Essentially, we like (that too, sometimes) the results of science, not science itself.   Indians with their poverty, backwardness, majoritarianism democracy where religions and dogmas dominate the society. Ffs we have all sorts of religions of the world man. Keep them in your fucking house. Having a communist government which had educated people at the helm. If Nehru and his contemporaries had ruled in a similar government they wouldn't have required people to get more and more illiterate to save their own positions of power. We had some of the greatest minds pre-independance. Most of them were educated outside and would have excelled in setting an efficient Constitution irrespective of Ideologies. Choosing Democracy only led to the populace dumber and dumber, and within a few decades the same people started ruling the subsequent governments. All parties in a democracy benefit from people's illiteracy. People are nothing but human resource to them. And then much later Capitalism arrived which let even third party groups to tap into this resource. We were a poor country during independance and we needed some form of autocracy or fascism(led by educated people) then to propel us towards a direction. 

As a poor country with democracy, we were destined to reach a shitty fascist government sometime. Turkey is a good example of what is to come. 

Ask yourself this, how much do you and I know about science, history or geography. Do we really deserve to vote on those matters without knowing much about them. Its impossible for people to know every field and that makes us vote based on ignorant opinions. In a fair world, geologists and environmentalists would vote for people to head the climate ministry, not vote for who to lead the law ministry. And China actually has that system where only qualified people have a say on relevant ministries. 

People who think astrology and ayurveda are science will vote for that type of party. And that party has no incentive to teach real science because that will remove them from power. In democracy, parties compete between themselves to stay in power. In Communism, party competes with world powers. US and the West in general are so advanced to begin with that they don't have to compete. That's why democracy works for them.

To those talking about ISRO funding and what not they are flourishing only because of our IAS administrators. Civil Service is the saving grace of our country. Add to that ISRO gained huge PR before BJP came to power and BJP can't underfund it now. All our MoUs with other countries are solely there because of our administrators not our netas. Edit: In the end what matters is whether the people are happy and the country is developing or not. China succeeds in both even though their citizens don't vote. Chinese really care about their country. Indians are too narrow minded and short-sighted in their thoughts and actions. Indians and specially the Indian political class only thinks about themselves and their families. Ideology. The governing party knows that the results will not be seen in their term, so they don't give a fuck. The next one comes, and thinks the same. And the cycle of stupidity continues. Democracy It's because they can make more money by investing in technology and other sciences. Also, being a totalitarian state helps. You are talking about a country and its politics that shuns religion versus one whose political parties thrive on it. we will get AI course in our univ when Mukesh bai decides so. face it fellow Indian's you live in an oligarchy, which is fast turning into a monarchy. elections, courts, executive all exist only to give a vision of credibility to this oligarchy.  In China, it is prohibited to be religious and hold an office in the government.  Good question my friend. IMO, it comes down to power. Without offending anyone, reality is half of our country thinks, talks and acts like they just climbed down from trees few years ago and reasoning with them on a technical foot is a daunting task. However, you can control them for years by taking them back in time with gaumutra and all other horseshit. Should our lawyer enforcement and political system made the leaders accountable (at least question) for their performance before elections, you would see leaders campaigning for science. Alas, it's easier to keep the dumbfucks busy with meat, militants and intolerance with a clear path to victory. Sad to see our country lose momentum! 

I'm heading to a bar, enough of this shit for today! China is more anti-lgbt than India, I don't see how that's pro science. It's only pro science when it comes to making itself more powerful. Genetic/cultural capital and an aggressive attitude almost on a war footing (or the lack thereof). Our democracy and modern culture is geared towards redistribution, appeasement, populism and egalitarianism while their's is towards building a powerful state and nation. Indian government now seems to feel investing in science is not important and does not deserve much investment. The government funding agencies for PhDs have reduced the number of scholarships and even some institutes have increased the fees for PhD students. Also funding to research labs have also reduced and so rate of research works have slowed down. I think the strain of anti intellectualism flows from the top. when people have been pollsters and pracharaks all their life they have no idea what it takes to build a strong country and how changes in technology effect the economy. The hardwork is better than harvard cry goes around. 

look at other progressive leaders like Chandrababu naidu and AK. The investment in education and health is going to help multiple generations of their constituents.  Because India wants to become a vishwaguru Because people who are in control are busy to think how to be in power for another year rather than doing something.  
Developed a Krishna themed park rather than a science exhibition. Strangely India has gone backwards. In the past we build ISRO ,IIT's , thorium based nuclear power program.

Just because research not happening in some advanced topics like AI, don't think it's not happening in India at all. Recently my college (one of the NIT) developed technology to make sand from flyash with just 40lakhs grant.

I agree that research spending in India is abysmal. Please don't make blanket assumptions. Because china is not burdened by muslims

How soon will some bhakt make this connection? Because in India AI stands for Akhand India. Religion India is kulcha approved science , ayurvada Religion. mad cow disease People get the government they deserve. Someone's already flagged you as an anti-national. The thing that baffles me is that China with 1000+characters has a higher literacy rate than India with our mere 46. Wtf is that. How could  so many successive  govts across parties be so lazy? Raising literacy in India shouldn't  be THAT hard. Well it's not really true that we have an anti-science government. India has all sorts of people and perceptions, and the same is reflected in our technological developments and their awareness. Only people who are involved in the science and technology field understand the great progress India is making, while those that are not involved think we are wasting time with ayurveda/gomutra etc.

 First and foremost reason is to see how long these countries have been in existence. India was unified relatively very late in 1947 however China has been unified for a long period of time under Ming, Qing etc. rule. However India is just a collection of 500 or so princely States and the infighting and distrust between these stats even now has undermined central rule and country is quite diverse in nature. However China is relatively uniform with same language being spoken in entire country and same religion, beliefs etc. This inturn reduces central workload and this greatly increases its productivity.

China is a communist country. You never know who becomes the president. However if a good person becomes the president he has far greater powers to enact reforms and China has been lucky with that. Also any form of student is severely crushed and people are killed for opposing current regime. Compare that to us, no one gives a damn on what you do. Recently a Chinese noble prize winner died in prison due to lack of proper medication. He was in prison for opposing the rule. There are numerous cases. See what they had done in 1999. I feel lucky to be in Democratic country.

Continuation of above point, due to communist country they punishment any criminals be it on corruption, murder etc. by death. Compare that to us where even if deadly terrorists are hanged, people go streets opposing the government. The point I want to make is they have strict rules and implementation is strict. So if any rules are enacted you just expect majority of population to follow it but that's not the case here. The amount of hate Modi gets here, if it were China randia, by now, must have reached 0 subscribers. Mind you Google and Facebook are banned there. Domestic companies are heavily preferred and given special privileges there. Not here, no one recognizes or heritage. Chinese is spoken everywhere around the country and is there native language. But we are always shameful while talking in Hindi Infront of strangers. I think we should accept Hindi as our national heritage alongside with our mother tongue.

China has been historically dominating the world. Had it not been the decision of some rule to stop building ships we might have been seeing China as the great world power. Great emphasis on education, art, literature has always been there in China. Trade routes were so improved and important that Europeans majority of import came from China and Magellan and his team went on voyage just to discover shorter path to China. India has never been a global power before. It's always been regional power struggle here. They promote win-win there, we promote win-lose here. Half of our energy is spent in trying to sabotage others. 

Mindset also plays a role. Everyone here is engineer or doctor and anything other is just not accepted. However that's isn't the case there. Research, sports, business are just as lucrative options as any other option. 

 

 Cause China is a communist country..public opinion dont matter there..India is doing way better than them in pharma, aerospace and information technology...China wants to seize the opportunity to make it self look big..but they will face worse recession. Then america Answer the 8 letter word : Hinduism. Pretty certain India is progressive in the field of science, even more than the US currently. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution

you just need to whack the religion out of society, downside is society with no moral values China has invested a lot on STEM education. The number of publications coming out of China is more than 3x compared to India. [reference](http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?year=2016). Anecdotally, the number of Chinese PhDs working in research labs of Silicon Valleys companies is 3 times that of Indian PhDs. Just one damn difference

I am planning a new digital learning initiative. I need your help.,22,8rsrvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8rsrvc/i_am_planning_a_new_digital_learning_initiative_i/,12,"I have just finished my school education in science in India, and am deeply concerned about the state of affairs. I wish to target specific areas.

Some complain that the system promotes ‘rote memorization’ and that the syllabus is ‘too theoretical’ and is not ‘practical’ or ‘linked with everyday life’.

The system is far worse than that.

In classes 1 to 10:

There is a heavy emphasis on regurgitation of memorised material.

There is too much ‘flab’ in the syllabus.

There is very less rigour in the subjects of maths and science.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to gain a comprehensive picture of a subject, but the line of questioning is such that you don’t need anything more than the textbooks.

There is not much focus given on seeing if students are capable of analysing new information and making pertinent observations.

Further questioning from the students’ side has no real outlet within the traditional syllabus.

In classes 11 and 12:

The rate at which information is to be consumed and understood increases dramatically.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to completely understand a subject BUT understanding is necessary to be able to survive the examinations.

Rote memorisation is an impediment, not an aid to success.

The line of questioning is far from direct. You need stop treating the syllabus as a body to remember, but as a set of tools in your arsenal to fix the problem. You have to generate independent results from the tools you are given.

Every piece of information in the syllabus is important and useful for examinations. There is nothing that you can’t know.

In the world of competitive exams:

You need to go well beyond the given syllabus.

You need to be able to think very creatively and come up with innovative solutions.

Emphasis is given on the ability to manipulate learnt content within extreme time constraints to solve the situation.

You can see the problem, can’t you? For the first 10 years of formal education, when they are in their most neurologically adaptive state, we expect students to have this conformist, regurgitative attitude towards academics, and then, when they are nearly adults, we expect them to have the analytical and creative problem-solving abilities of mini-Einsteins.

There are three categories of students who survive this catastrophe.

The real prodigies. These students quickly learn to move ahead of the existing syllabus and go onward. I respect and admire them.

Those whose circumstances give them a head start. This was me. I hated rote memorisation so I would do the bare minimum necessary. I’m not saying that I performed bad, academically, in classes 1 to 10. It’s just that where the others were busy memorising whole passages verbatim, I was looking at a few key words and facts and building up the rest in the exam hall. That’s the only way I kept a facade up despite a lousy work ethic. Since I was already accustomed to never memorising, it was mainly a matter of adjusting to the new rate and new depth.

Those who can work really, really hard. I admire the sheer determination of this category, and they often overlap with 1. and 2. , but many of them continue with the verbatim approach and clear the struggle by memorising every case and every type of problem possible.

We need to fix this. We need to expose students to a problem-solving based curriculum from day one. We also need to make the syllabus far less top-heavy. With just one or two more chapters in each subject every year, we could have the whole of class 1 to 10 over a couple of years earlier.

In the traditional system, I would have said that this is impossible. It needs a curriculum change, reskilling of teachers, change of public policy, bulldozing public opinion that school is becoming ‘harder’, and forcing experimental teaching and evaluation methods on schoolchildren.

In the digital world, creating an adaptive learning system for such a goal is a far less difficult challenge.

In my ‘ideal-scenario’ curriculum, I would focus on only four skills:

Critical reading: In the current scenario, learning the ‘chapters’ is given more emphasis than on checking if students can actually process new passages of information. Most students are unable to self-learn and are dependent on spoonfeeding for this reason.

Critical writing and grammar: I don’t mean the typical ‘parts-of-speech-in-detail’ grammar. I just mean being able to differentiate between correct and incorrect English grammar and being able to apply it to express new ideas. Once students can do this, they no longer have to memorise passages to answer in exams — they can construct their own sentences.

Arithmetic and geometry: Pretty self explanatory.

Logical reasoning: This is not subject-specific. It should be done in a way which is independent of any particular technical subject. In the JEE, the content is based on PCM, but they actually test us on our critical thinking and logical reasoning ability — using the subject as a medium. We don’t have to use any prerequisite subject.

I need the help of subject curriculum and testing experts, web designers, teachers, students, and anybody else who feels that they can contribute to this project.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you saw my above post, then you know what this is about.

I really, really need help from experts in both education (in both STEM and liberal arts) and technology implementation (primarily web design, UX/UI etc.)

Otherwise, I guess it is up to only me to revise 12 years of syllabus for a broken system, rewrite and execute lecture videos, come up with suitable assessments, code the adaptive assessment system, build the website, and deploy it.

All of that, assuming I already know how to do it, would take at least a year for one person to execute -- that's assuming they are working full time.

Which I can't.

And that's if I knew how to do everything by myself.

Which I don't.

What this means is that without help, this project in it's current form will be over before it even got started.

Even if you can't join the core dev team, it would be a huge step forward if you could direct me somehow to find the support I need for this project.

Thanks,

Planner

Chanakya Digital Accelerated Learning Initiative (can find me on Quora under the username ""CDALI Planner"")",plannercdali," Count me in. I'm interested!  I have a few questions for you

1) do you have funding?

2) Are you going to be doing this full time? What about your higher education?

3) you're looking at a syllabus for all 12 years right from 1st standard?

4) platform? Mobile /PC /Web Hi, 

Amazing thought and it was wonderful to read your post and so much energy flowing into improving the quality of learning in our country. What you are thinking is absolutely right, how you would want to do it may require very serious consideration. You have to be very careful to not fall into the trap of what all has already been tried in the Indian education space. 

Honestly, what I have seen in the last 8 years with most organisations and inspired individuals like you is that they take a me too approach at solving this vast education problem in India. And that's one reason why we are yet to see one single solution reach mass scale. What we need is an integrated and a partnership driven approach to solve the problem at scale. 

I will give you an example to explain this better. 

When you talk to someone who wishes to transform our education, majority start talking about developing the content. What most don't understand is that there is so much content already available in English and in several local languages, across multiple subjects and grades. However, all content development is piecemeal. Which means that there is one company building apps on Math and then there is another creating animated videos in Science. Then, there would be someone who is working on assessments. And each one of them feels that their's is the best way to educate the child. Each one of them is trying to reach the same audience, albeit individually. To make content, you need lot of time, money and resources. And once you invest so much in making content, your only approach is to monetise that content piece and all your energies are towards this only. You therefore fail to see the larger picture. 

Second issue I have observed with educationists is that we end up giving too much structure to the way a child should learn. There is no space for the child to experiment and enjoy learning. You would know that historical learning gap is one of the major challenges in rural learning. A class 5 student cannot solve basic mathematics sum of class 2. A class 6 student cannot read words that a class 3 child should. And there is no way currently by which you can bridge this gap. By over structuring the learning and making it too teacher centric, we are depriving the child to happily switch to lower grades and cover up their basics. How can we expect a child to develop life skills that will help him grow. 

When we were starting[ iDream Education](https://www.idreameducation.org) after having worked in the education space for 6 years, we took a conscious call to take an integrated approach. We took years to go through multiple content pieces available and cracked the best way to integrate them, structure them and present them to a child under one dashboard. We have built a multilingual, personalised and an adaptive learning platform that integrates multiple categories of learning content from multiple sources thereby empowering each child to choose their own style and pace of learning.  We are taking a student centric approach to learning that also makes the life of a teacher much easier. 

What we have done so far is taken an integrated approach to content and the solution. The second part of the game is to create a channel to be able to reach schools and children at the lowest cost possible. A lot of organisations take a me too approach here also. Having learnt our lesson, we have chosen to take an integrated approach to building reach as well. We are therefore partnering with NGOs, aspiring education entrepreneurs and people who already running a school service and distribution business. The key is to build a sustainable and scalable business and social impact model that build both social and commercial value for everyone in the ecosystem. I have written more about the opportunity in the space of personalised digital learning [here](http://www.idreameducation.org/blog/social-business-opportunity-personalised-digital-learning/). 

Please do reach out to me if you find genuine value in what we are doing. ",Science/Technology,2018-06-18 02:01:13

> [The Indian martial art -Kalaripayattu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aevd3Vqylk)

>>In this documentary, we look at one of the world's oldest and most dangerous martial arts: Kalarippayattu. Closely linked to Hinduism, Kalari means: battlefield/gym and Puttara means: platform/stage. This may translate loosely into something like ""Fight Club""!

>>This fighting art was only used by a special class of warriors in ancient times of war to protect their king and masters -they would fight to the death.

>>Practitioners of this art believe that animals are the best fighters because they're natural and don't have to think about what they're doing. They simply...act -instinctively!

>>The British outlawed this art, out of fear while they occupied India.

>>Martial artists of this style don't normally train with metal weapons until they've practiced for 6 years with the standard wooden ones.

>>Jimmy Smith, the professional MMA fighter has a large Ganesh (""Remover of Obstacles"" elephant god) tattoo on his back!


> Interestingly, according to legend and on observation and analysis of the movements involved, many say that Kalarippayattu is the source of Shaolin kung-fu. It was said to be taken by Bodhidharma or Da Mo: The legendary monk who took Buddhism to China (circa 500 AD).

> He is the 28th patriarch of Buddhism, credited with founding ""Zen Buddhism"" and is popularly considered as the patron saint or the founding father of Shaolin Kung-fu. He is believed to have been the 3rd son of the Pallava king Sugandan and his birthplace is considered to be the ancient Pallavan capital city- Kanchipuram. 

> Being a member of a royal family he had to have had a military education and training on order to one day succeed his father. He trained in the Indian martial art of kalaripayattu which is considered to be one of the oldest fighting systems in existence. He came in contact with Buddhism and became a pupil of teacher Prajnatara (the 27th Buddha).

> According to Chinese Legend,he also began the physical training of the Shaolin Monks that led to the creation of Shaolin Quan. There are numerous stories and legend that has become associated with him in China he had been elevated to almost a ""demi-god"" level status over the years. His figure has decorated Chinese and Japanese households for more than a thousand years and is considered to be a talisman for good luck.

********************************************",MainTeraBaap," If I may, please include Nero's Guests as well. It's a fascinatingly depressing documentary about farmers in rural India. Has P. Sainath in it. What a ridiculously good post!

Saving this for later. Watching the first one now. Wow! Kindly include ""India Untouched: Stories of a People Apart "" it is a real eye opener. It is a little disturbing that all that Al Jazeera publishes is bad news about India? Please include: The Indian town with 6000 widows

[The Invisible Women: India's ostracized widows.](https://rtd.rt.com/films/the-invisible-women/)

 For more about Indian widows, watch[ ""Water"" (2005)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240200/) by Deepa Metha and the documentary [“White Rainbows” (2005)](http://whiterainbow.com/)

 Just how much time did it take you to collect these ? Btw, starred Great list, thanks! I really enjoyed the frontier railways one people are talking about.

I’d like to add a vote for The Ganges with Sue Perkins. It’s from the BBC and on at the moment. 2/3 have aired so far. Please OP include ""Bhopal : A prayer for Rain"". A critically acclaimed movie staring Rajpal Yadav and Kal Penn. Brought tears to my eyes. Available at D@ilym0tion. Good one OP.these kind of gems i want from randia.  I normally avoid documentaries involving India because it makes me feel a lot worse about this country and its bleak future, even more that I can't do anything about it. It's lame I know.

 anyways, great compilation. I'd try watching these sometime. put this in the sidebar somewhere pls Nice list op fuck me twice when the donkey strikes two eight and a horse! what a great great post - thanks too much! What a Gold Mine of a thread!! When will Al zajeera document Saudi Arabia s humna rights violations? Never. Can't ignore this post any more. Had a few more documentaries tucked away in my bookmarks:

We really need to talk about Flairs.,108,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",Science/Technology,2017-05-15 21:21:16
Pride and Prejudice,96,6s6xir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6s6xir/pride_and_prejudice/,76,"I was having a beer while reading a book in the cafeteria in Deutsches Museum. A middle aged couple sat next to me. The lady said, ""Hello"".
""Hello"", I replied. The gentleman joined in, ""Studying in Munich?""
""No. Working"", I said. 
""Where you are from?""
""India"", I said. 
""Oh we are also originally from India. We live in USA. 20 years. Came here to visit our daughter and our grandchildren. We are originally from this city of that state in India"". I smiled and nodded and started speaking to them about that city in that state in India because I also lived there for 7 years. He started saying how much he misses his city and his country, being 20 long years in USA. I smiled and listened although I wanted to return to my book. Here I was sitting surrounded by the statues of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, Leibnitz and hundreds of scientists and mathematicians, the descriptions and depictions of their work in one of the best technical museums of the world containing hundreds of machines of the past, computers, ships, aircrafts, telescopes and what not and suddenly the gentleman said, ""No matter what one says, we are far ahead than them"". I was puzzled. ""What are we talking about?""

The man said, ""In shastra it is written - Everything comes from water and fire. Have you read Veda?"" and then he unfurled a shloka from Veda. I was quite amused. He then continued, ""Our Munis and Rishis have written everything about nuclear physics 5000 years back"". I interjected, ""That I would not know but I think that the contributions of the likes of Ramanujan, Bose, Raman and Chandrasekhar were enormous"". He skirted those names and said, ""I am an engineer. I have to tell you that India is at least 1000 years ahead than any country in science. One has to read Veda"" and then he fired another sloka. His wife was not getting impressed just as I was not making much sense of the sudden outpouring of Sanatan sentiments. 

I realised that it was better to move. But then he did not stop, ""You see it is a matter of what I call perspective. We knew thousands of years back what scientists here are knowing now. Chemistry, atomic physics, space everything we knew. At that time Europe was what? A dark continent. They knew nothing. We invented Zero, you know that?"" 

This is when I lost it. I asked him, ""Sir, you miss your city and your food and friends. That is quite understandable. But I do not understand why you have spent 20 years in USA and your daughter is married in Munich while you miss your country so much and you cannot stop praising it. Why don't you go and live in India? I also do not understand why you are even here when you should be in India digging Vedic spacecrafts. Why do you come to a Science and Technology museum in Germany to claim superiority on others' achievements? Indeed one can take the Indian out of India but one cannot take the India out of the Indian.""

His wife tugged at his arm before things escalated because I guess he was about to throw another salvo of slokas. They got up and left. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. It is not the ignorance that hurts so much, it is the misplaced pride that left me dumbfound and sick in my guts. ",airwolf1989," I really hate it when religious folk try to twist scientific facts just so that they can wank to their religion or kulcha and claim how superior it is to others.  Hindutava in Germany. >
indeed one can take the Indian out of india but can't take the india out of an Indian.

indeed one can take the Indian out of india but can't take the stupidity out of an Indian.

FTFY.
 I've met a couple of morons like this in the US. I swear, some NRIs who left India in the 70s and 80s are still stuck in those decades. 

I would have pretended to agree with him just to see how far he would take it. /r/thathappened
 Why are so many incredibly successful Indians such retards? Tragic. 

Also, woe-betide the countries which are deceived into believing that these kinds of people have any amount of respect for their adopted lands.  well done, sir. you could've used your middle finger sloka. I have met many people who are similar in their attitude of India is vastly superior and yet when I question them as to why they wouldn't return and instead stay outside they deflect and are not ready to provide any answers. If we were so advanced why did we fail so pathetically to stop the invaders from central Asia? Were they all supermen? 
I don't know why by NRIs seem more conservative than average Indians Ha! yet anther smartass, glib-tongued, kulcha-warrior Indian, most likely Brahmin and from New Jersey.

He must be real proud of Currywurst.

also 20 years is nothing. you could have just humored him and let it go.  Who reads Pride and Prejudice in a German museum, man? /s lol more like 1000 years behind in some cities/states. When will another asteroid hit? > ""Our Munis and Rishis have written everything about nuclear physics 5000 years back"".

Even I agree with this statement, why didn't our uncle do anything to use it? Thousands of people dying from hunger, unsanitary conditions, lack of healthcare and these morons think that we are far superior from US (or any other first world country)   I'm glad you feel are much more learned, intellectual, and cosmopolitan than a man probably twice your age who openly admitted to being homesick after decades spent in foreign societies with no hope of ever feeling like he's just another 'normal local' in either USA/Germany or a constantly changing India ever again.",Science/Technology,2017-08-08 01:05:42
How's IIIT Jabalpur? And BIT Mesra?,12,8gqdc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8gqdc8/hows_iiit_jabalpur_and_bit_mesra/,10,"With my current rank I can get CSE at IIIT Jabalpur, Information Technology at BIT Mesra, CSE at NIT Srinagar and at newer NITs. I'm interested in doing CS/Math/Physics/Econ (more inclined towards CS) and want to do master's from a good foreign Univ (because higher education is not so good here). I'll get SRCC, Hindu, Hansraj for Eco/Math/Physics.

I'm afraid that probably I won't get good LoRs from IIIT Jabalpur or BIT Mesra. Besides, professors there are not good. What should I do?

I want a career in data science/ML. I have done some projects in ML and I love doing that. However, I am flexible.
",darkrai_28," Take economics in SRCC. You'll not regret. You can do ML research living in Delhi along with good exposure to industry, workshops, like minded people. I'm IT freshmen in tier 1 college but in a shittiest city I've ever seen. I regret not choosing Delhi colleges. So a good city plays a major role if you are a self learner.  go for Eco at SRCC. If not, then go for BIT Mesra. Atleast better than a year gap or something. If your long term goal is foreign Uni, have a good name in your resume like SRCC.",Science/Technology,2018-05-03 21:29:44

Is it advisable to do MS in Data Science after 4 years of experience?,56,7bz6o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7bz6o9/is_it_advisable_to_do_ms_in_data_science_after_4/,30,"I have been working as software developer mostly in mobile technologies, but I want to shift to data science. I have good command in Maths, statistics and aptitude. But I am worried that maybe I have too much experience? 
",apjabdulkalam," I have 3.5 years and I have already applied for a masters. It's your wish. Do it if you want to. Don't do it if you have goals like marriage at 26 and babies at 28 and all that. Better to just do certifications and try for a data analyst's job. How can you have too much experience when you have 0 years of experience in Data Science?

Obviously employers are not going to consider software dev experience for data science jobs especially as there is nothing transferable from software dev to data science.

If you are wondering whether you are ""too old"" to do a Masters, that is something that can be only answered based on your personal circumstances. I am planning for MS and I have 5.5 years work ex. Having experience actually helps in finding good jobs after Masters. You should go for it if you are really serious. Lot of people do masters after 5-8 years of experience. Yes. It's a good specialization to get a degree on. Wait, you think 4 years counts as ""too much experience""? 4 years is nothing. In any case, don't let these things stop you from doing what you want to do. I switched my line (not data science) by doing a masters after 7 years of work. So, you'll be fine. I'd say try to get some job experience in the field before jumping into a very costly, and rather risky, investment. 

Speaking as someone who has interviewed several people after they got out of MS Data Science/Analytics degrees, I'd much rather hire someone with a couple of years of live experience under their belt. 


Learn the R/python bits of data science, take a few courses/certifications to make sure you know your alphas from your betas, and start applying to analytical firms or the DS wings of larger companies in India. The non-resident job market for data science US is pretty slim as well, graduate degree or no.

Obviously, take your chances etc. But know that it can be risky, and you shouldn't expect a red carpet after your MS.

And know SQL. Seriously. You would not believe the number of people who apply for data science jobs without knowing what is still the most common language for extracting data. Education will never go waste

Edit: Wow downvotes, People always starts counting benifits in terms of how much money you can earn directly out of it. Both are not dependent. All earners might not educated and all educated might not be earning. So my point is if you are interested in getting educated in something, suggestion is get educated. Follow your interest friends not your mates. 4 years is higher than average, but not terribly unusual. It's kind of late to start applying for next year's Fall application cycle imo, but you should try out next year if you're seriously interested. A few schools even have Spring admits, so that's something you should look into. I don't think it should be a problem to switch fields. As long as you are willing to learn and make the transition.

Not sure how exactly pure MS in DS/BA programs are, I heard an AMA somewhere on reddit, I think /r/datascience that most of them and even certifications in that field are essentially cash-grabs.

Check out /r/ datascience for similar questions and resources.

 its all your personal preference , i was in same dilemma year back, then i put my foot down and went for masters in data science.

 You'll always get 1000 reasons not to pursue masters / any other course and stay in your comfort zone. 

You have to decide what you want change in your life or you like it just it's going on like now.

"How an ambulance rushed through 500+ kilometers of narrow roads in Kerala in 6 hours to transport a critically sick baby - A true story of unity, determination, and togetherness.",132,7dkd0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7dkd0z/how_an_ambulance_rushed_through_500_kilometers_of/,15,"I had written this as a late comment on [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7decjh/np_this_is_thameem_the_ambulance_driver_who_drove/) which blew up to get 1000+ upvotes. Someone suggested me to write it as a post to get better visibility. So, here is it.

The baby was sick in a pretty good hospital, but possibly had some serious heart issue, and one of the best specialized cardiac hospital in the country is this hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. They have researched and developed even their own prosthetic heart. 

The hospital where the baby was taken to is a super specialized hospital made exclusively to research and treat the heart disease of kids. It's name itself is Pediatric Cardiology Medical College due to its specialty. They only take extreme referral cases like this one. 

This hospital was founded before the independence by Maharaja of Travancore because his son, crown prince Sree Avittom Thirunal Rama Varma had an untreatable heart disease since his birth which led to his death at the age of six and the Maharaja wanted no one to suffer the same fate, hence such a super specialized hospital to research such diseases was created in his memory with the name Sree Avittom Thirunal(SAT) Hospital at a time period when even normal hospitals were rare in India.

Later, another bigger hospital was also started by the last Maharaja next to this hospital with more departments called Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum. And, this hospital was pioneers of various things in the field of cardiac medical science in the world. The baby was taken to this hospital.

This was the reason why the baby had to be transported there instead of any other hospital in the country. It was just the best option for the survival of the baby.

**Air ambulance** was ruled out because of the critical condition of the baby who had much better chances with a land-based ambulance.

Kerala has a good road network, but the roads are narrow due to the population density of the state. At many places, it is just one lane in both directions. Any traffic can delay by a lot. The normal journey in this route will take over 14 hours, yet this ambulance reached in less than half of that time - 6hours 40mins.

This was done due to the help of some volunteers across the state. A GPS device was attached to the ambulance and the location was transmitted to everyone. There were WhatsApp groups with people around the state.

When the ambulance is near any of the volunteer's location, they will remove the traffic of that location so that the ambulance can pass without any traffic. This was how they were able to travel at such speeds through so many towns. During the entire journey, they only had to slow down once at Alapuzha. Other than that, everything went smooth. There are lot of [videos on social media](https://twitter.com/Advaidism/status/931063525493022720) of people controlling traffic at various parts of the state

Along with volunteers, police also helped. Police vehicles escorted the ambulance during the entire journey and traffic police of each district made the arrangements to make the roads as clear as possible. It helped the Ambulance maintain 100 to 120kmph speed.

This story is not just about the ambulance driver. It is not just about the driver who drove the police escort vehicles in front of the ambulance. It is not about any single individual. Instead, it is about what we can achieve if a lot of people come together as one force. It is about togetherness. It is about unity. This story is awesome because so many people came together that day to make this happen.

Few such incidents have happened in the past too. A Malayalam movie named Traffic (2011) was made loosely based on a real incident similar to this. It is an excellent movie worth watching.  Traffic movie was remade into Tamil as Chennaiyil Oru Naal, in Kannada as Crazy Star and is also remade in Hindi, with the same name Traffic (2016). The best one is, of course, the original movie.  Watch the original movie if you can, as it is a unique movie which is shot from the perspective of a dozen people in a way no Indian movie has done before.

News  article - https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/this-is-how-people-in-kerala-came-together-to-make-way-for-an-ambulance-carrying-a-2-month-old-baby-333771.html",fsko," The video makes my heart swell.

I wish we can see such camaraderie in everyday life in India, it will surely be a better place.  bravo somalian pirates, you robbed ship carrying my heart.. Sorry this may seem crass to point out in such a serious issue , but I find it really funny that some producer in Kannada industry thought to name their movie about life saving ambulance as 'crazy star'.  Last year I had to travel from Thrissur to Trivandrum in an ambulance. The driver was pretty fast and it was quite scary to look through the windshield. The vehicle had to turn and weave quite a lot because of the narrow roads. Our roads really need to be widened. I had driven the other way just the previous day in my car. Since the vehicles move for you when you are in a blaring ambulance, it does give you a perspective of how fast travel within Kerala could be with wider roads.  When we are ""we"" ,

History of India where Indus valley civilization survives and latter is conquered by vedic aryans,2,9b4xnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9b4xnx/history_of_india_where_indus_valley_civilization/,2,"Pre vedic age 1500 BC to 1000 BC
While the Rig Veda was composed in our time line during 1500 BC and was penned down during 1200 BC . The core philosophy of the rig Veda was formulated prior to 1500 BC and the scholars debate the exact time during which it was developed.While it is agreed that the core philosophy evolved during 1800-1600 BC . The rig vedas were written in vedic sanskrit which a closely related to the early avestan language.
While the rig Veda goes into details of the life lead by the vedic Aryans and contains hymns sung in praise of gods and some parts of rig vedas deal with philosophy and metaphysical matters

vedic Aryans in our time line left central Asia around 1800 BC well before Iranians left for Iran. While I don't want to get into the arguments of whether the vedic Aryans came directly from the andronovo culture or from andronovo to oxus river valley civilization and then to Hindu kush mountains and then to mordern day Greater Punjab and from there to the rest of India

But in this time line rig veda or any other is not composed during the 1500 BC but latter during 1000 BC . In our time line the vedic Aryans did not encounter any resistance when they settled down in mordern day Punjab as the remnants of the indus valley civilization had disappeared and only a few people resided in the Punjab. These people were absorbed by the vedic Aryans. While there was certain conflicts between the natives and the vedic Aryans and also the vedic Aryans and other indo Aryans tribes but not on the scale of Iranian tribes conflicts with Scythians, Elamite, urartu and neo Assyrian empire and also other people of the iranian plateau. These conflicts played a crucial role in the unification of various Iranian tribes .With the vedic Aryans the lack of serious threats resulted in conflicts between themselves eg bàttle of ten kings on the banks of the river Ravi.

Further since the collapse of indus valley civilization the urbanization in the Indian subcontinent received a huge set back since no major urbanization takes place till 500 BC and that's after a gap of nealy 1300 years from the collapse of indus valley civilization

In our time line The indus valley civilization collapsed in and around 1900 BC which was caused due to the change in the course of the indus river and also due to the change in the climate which occurred during that time period which caused the collpase of river valley civilization around the world and also caused the movement of various tribes including the vedic-aryans and the Iranian tribes . The collpàse was further accelerated because of civil war and diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis.

In this alternate time line the indus valley civilization survived though it initially suffered from the climatic changes and the change in the course of the indus river but it never had to suffer from the outbreaks of diseases and civil war . Thus the civilization survived and The people of this civilization adapted to the change and built new cities and settlements though the new settlement and cities were not in the size of the former cities and settlements But nonetheless the civilization survived and was recovering.
It was during 1700-1600bc that the vedic Aryans began to settle in and around the modern day Afghanistan in otl and by 1500 BC they vedic Aryans began their raids into the river valley civilization. Most of these raids were resisted and the vedic Aryans were driven back beyond the Khyber pass. The indus valley civilization at that point in time was made up of a single empire that sprung up from the times of trouble of 1900 BC . While much is not known about this empire but we know from the vedas that the empire was a centralised entity and worshipped false gods. The indus valley empire was able to defeat certain vedic Aryans tribes and Indo Aryan tribes and subjugate them. These tribes were made to pay tribute and in return the empire offered protection from other vedic Aryans tribes thus forming a effective buffer states.

This state of affairs continued till 1300 BC when the vedic Aryans in face of threats from migrating Iranian tribes and also from the pressure of the indus valley empire united under the leadership of Bharatha tribe . While this confederation intially did not cause a lot of trouble to the indus valley empire as the confederacy of vedic tribes were busy fighting Iranian and other indo Iranian tribes further north . These tribal war lasted for a century. While the vedic Aryans were not successful against the iranian tribes they were successful against other indo Iranian tribes further north and assimilated these tribes into vedic Fold further increasing in size and territories.

This increase in size caused concern to the indus valley emperor who sought to break the conferdacy up with tact and diplomacy and also by military campaign. It was during these times according to many scholars that major political changes took place in the vedic Aryans confederation. The vedic Aryans tribes over a period of time went from being nomadic pastorialist to settled farmers even though significant number of tribes were nomadic . The vedic Aryans were also influenced by the governance style of the indus valley empire and began to adopt the system of government of the indus valley empire. They aslo began to combine the elements of warfare practice of the indus valley empire with that of their own . Soon the vedic Aryans were strong enough to take on the indus valley empire.

In and around1200 BC the vedic Aryans tribes under the leadership of Bharatha tribe declared war on the indus valley empire on the ground that the empire was interfering with the internal affairs of the vedic Aryans tribes. At the time the vedas noted it was like an ant declaring war on an elephant. The empire though concerned did not make much of the threat and was thus ill prepared to deal with the new and powerful vedic Aryans

The vedas of this time line noted that this war lasted for 22 years but the major conflicts were decided in the first ten years and the last revolt of the subjugated empire occured in the 22 year after the war began . This leads us to a conclusion that the war was over by ten years and the rest of the 12 years the vedic Aryans spent the time putting down revolts

Consequences of the conquest of the indus valley empire on the vedic-aryans and history of the Indian subcontinent

A. Popularity of centralised state with a absolute monarch ruling a vast empire

Any person who has studied political science knows that vast empires create centralised state and favours absolute monarchy and vicea versa especially in a time before the advent of mordern day communication

In our time line the Bharatha merged with the puru tribe to create the powerful kuru kingdom in mordern day Pakistani Punjab but in this time line the merger does take place but there is no change on name as Bharathas in this time line were leaders of the vedic Aryan tribal confederation and as such name change is out of the question. While not much is known of the kings of the Bharatha tribe before 1200 BC but post 1200 BC there is a complete list of kings . While scholars of our time line and this time line agree that Bharatha tribe before it's meger with other tribes had a tribal council called sabha and samithi and it's society was egalitarian and democratic in nature but in this time line after the series of merger with other tribes and absorption of non Vedic Indo Aryan tribes and after assuming the leadership of the tribal confederation and more importantly the influence of the indus valley empire lead to creation of a new form of political structure ,the absolute kingship . While in our time line it was only around 500 BC that strong monarchical states emerged and it would take another two hundred years before the first empire known as the Nanda empire would emerge the same empire that Alexander the greats troops who were already de moralized refused to face the empire in war as it was said that Nanda empire had the largest and the most powerful army in the world but the concept of absolute kingship did not emerge with the nandas it was the Mauryan Empire the had the concept of absolute kingship and this evidenced by the hatered of the Maurays to the Mahajanapada and vice versa and also from Arthashastra

In this time line absolute kingship was known to the vedic Aryan tribes as it was followed by the indus valley empire and it's adoption by the vedic Aryans and the subsequent conquest of the indus valley civilization by the vedic Aryans caused a huge butterfly event . The concept of absolute monarchy much was unknown to the vedic Aryans is championed by them in this time line and this was the first major consequence and change from our time line. The consequences of this change are many folds . The obvious one is a centralised government is popular with the elites and the masses than in our time line. Further an absolute monarchy combined with a centralised state encourages unity and uniformity in political level and to some extent even in cultural level as religions in this time line in general and Hinduism in particular now champions the cause of absolute monarchy and a centralised state including large empires . Further with a history of centralised control and absolute monarchy creates an incentive for large empire because to achieve centralised control and to regin as an absolute monarch in a reasonable manner large empires are a pre requisite so instead of small to medium sized confederation that was characterized in our time line the history of India in this time line is characterized by strong authoritarian central government ruling a large empire

B Urbanization of the subcontinent

While in our timeline second wave of urbanization takes place around 500 BC but in this time line since the indus valley civilization survived and people continued to live in the 1052 or so urban settlement spread throughout the indus valley civilization at the time of its collapse in our time line. The vedic Aryans after conquest soon begin to adopt a urban life style and many more who are nomadic pastorialist settle down to become farmers in the indus valley whose population has been recovering since the times of trouble in the 1900 BC this massive influx of people from the west who begin to settle down and cultivate the fertile indus valley resulted in a revival of agriculture in the river valley not seen since the days of mature harappa civilization of our timeline

The indus valley civilization for all its advances in science and technology did not have much knowledge of irrigation system which in our time line was the main cause of its decline . While in this time line they did learn to irrigate the land and survive as a result their knowledge of irrigation was poor at best when compared to vedic Aryans who had good experiences and knowledge of irrigation systems as they irrigated the arid lands of central Asia during the middle bronze age . The vedic Aryans just like in our time line began to irrigate the land by building canals and small dams this brought in further lands under cultivation and made agriculture in the indus valley less dependent upon the unpredictable monsoon and increased the agricultural output from the land by many folds. This over a period of time lead to an increase in population of the indus valley but more importantly it resulted in further urbanization of the indus valley because of the surplus agricultural production. Thus the foundation of urbanization was secured
Further urbanization requires a strong central government as this was discussed in the previous point we can say the logical consequence of this that the central government will built new or renovate old cities to increase the control and to bring in further revenue in the form of taxes from industries ,trade and commerce
The retention of the knowledge and experience of the indus valley civilization has already been discussed in the beginning
These factors will cause an increase in the urbanization aswell as primitive industrialization which latter on spread throughout the sub continent

C Increase in foreign trade and consequently increase in the knowledge of foreign lands

While it may come as a surprise for many but the people of the indus valley civilization were proficient in conducting sea voyage and were experts in building rocks and ports . The best example of their proficiency is the docks and ports of lothal in present day indian state of Gujarat. While vedic Aryans who were not known much for their sea trade aswell as land trade . This resulted in the indian subcontinent being cutoff from the social and technological development of foreign lands as consequence of this isolation the social and economic and scientific development of the subcontinent was not shared with the foregin lands or it resulted in delayed or stunted development of the subcontinent in various areas .

An active foreign trade will have further accelerated impact on urbanisation as artisans and metal smiths and other industries have a much larger market to cater to and from the point of view of the government it will increase the amount of revenue in the form of taxes
In this time line the vedic Aryans because of the inhabitants of the indus valley civilization come into contact with Elamite, neo Babylonian empire, neo Assyrian empire, various Iranian tribes of the Iranian plateau and as a result of this contact apart from increase in prosperity as a result of foreign trade the people of the subcontinent also come into contact with foreign ideas and scientific development and the people of the middle East with that of India . While this will not cause huge butterfly effects in the political arena but the impact of this contact on religion and science and technology is not clear. There will be an increase in the speed of scientific and technological advances than what we see in our time line but in my opinion this will not result in major changes in the course of political and military events but rather a change in the standard of living of the people around the ancient world. To give an example by having contact with the people of the Iranian plateau who had advanced knowledge of irrigation systems the people of the subcontinent begin to use some of the irrigation techniques of the Iranians to improve the irrigation system of their own thereby increasing crop yields or using it to deliver water to the cities in a much more efficient manner

D. Socio religious changes

The indus valley civilization of our time had by the mature stage developed a very complex social heirrachy . While the details of this social order is not known in our time line and in this time line also the deatils are not known but the caste system that emerged in this time line may be same as that of the social order that prevailed in this alternate time line indus valley civilization but with certain changes. While this caste system is not as rigid as the caste system of our time line as it did allow individuals and communities to improve their status . It is a fact that the caste system in our time line was not rigid until the Gupta's lost power due to the invasion of hepthalites and during the islamic invasion of india this caste system further de generated into a ridiculously stupid system that emerged as a parallel power to the state authority but on the filp side it helped hindus preserve their customs and tradtion by locking them in a state of perpetual stagnation but in this time line the caste system will remain liberal when compared to our time line ,the reason for this is a strong central government and a Monotheistic religion combined with a high level of urbanization and industrial growth. Any person who studied indian history knows that when a strong Hindu state emerged the caste system always weakened and even during the zenith of caste rigidity that is during the 10th to 17th century the Monotheistic movements within hinduism emerged as the enemy of the caste system as the common doctrine of all these movements was all people are equal in the eyes of god as there is only one god we are his children. They stood against discrimination on the grounds of caste especilly the parctise of untouchability ( which in my opinon is kinda stupid) and had a common values and ethics system which kept them united and promoted group solidarity. In this time line as the form of government is centralised autocratic monarchy and the religion being Monotheistic the caste system is more like a class system and the practice of untouchability is never heard of and people of all social classes are given access to place of worship and other public places . Further in this time line the concepts of karma, papa, punya,janma , punar janma etc are present but they don't develop into a complex concepts which was used to justify the caste system as the concept of free will is more popular than vidhi or Brahma lipi or Fate in simple English fate ( but for non Indians reading this i do suggest that you google the concepts that I have written herein before and their impact on social development of indian subcontinent)

As I stated in the beginning the hinduism of this time line is MONOTHEISTIC and the hindus worship lord Brahma and regard fire as the image of Brahma and thus much like the zoroastrian people hindus in this time line also construct fire temples

The reason why hinduism in this time line borrows heavily from proto Zoroastrian ideas and beliefs is the fact that vedic sanskrit and early avestan language is very similar and since hindus of this time line are in more active contact with the Iranian tribes in the Iranian plateau which is the place where proto Zoroastrian religion was practised a lot of concepts of that religion makes its way to hinduism . While the gods of indus valley civilization are assimilated into the vedic Aryan religion as Demi gods

The reason why hinduism in this time line is Monotheistic and puts more emphasis on free will and good vs evil is because the birth place of hinduism or Brahmanism as it will be known in this time line is not limited to Punjab as it was the case in our time line but the whole of indus valley Afghanistan and Balochistan and further since the development of Vedas and other religious concepts are delayed because of the wars that the vedic Aryans fought with the Iranian tribes and other indo Aryans tribes and also the indus valley empire the vedic Aryans put more value in unity and order and the wars have a crucial impact on the society of the vedic Aryans in that the warriors and noble family establish their dominance over the priestly class as warrior are valued more than the intellectuals or people who recites hymns. Further since the place of development of hinduism is more extensive in geographical terms and is subject to foreign influence because of trade in this time line the vedic Aryans come into contact with proto Zoroastrian ideas of eastern Iranian plateau as vedic sanskrit and early avestan language are similar making it possible for the ideas of free will , good vs evils aand Monotheistic ideas to cross over from the Iranian plateau to the vedic Aryans tribes in the indus valley. What may also makes a cross over into hinduism is the concept of good and evil which has a similar concept in Hinduism of our time line as Dharma and Adharma but the concept of Dharma is much more complex than the concept of good and evil as the equivalent concept of Dharma is justice and the lord of justice is lord Yama the lord of the under world so if the concept of good and evil does make it into hinduism then it may become more mazadyasna than Brahmanism but in this time line hindus will still have the concept of Dharma and Adharma but since it is a Monotheistic religion in this time line the lord of the underworld and justice is also the lord of the universe that is the one and only God Brahma . So in this time line while the goal of moksha ( freedom from birth and rebirth) the ultimate goal of all hindus but the complex ideas of punya and papa will not be so dominant and makes its way to other concepts. In our time line the idea that deeds of a man in his previous life determined in which caste he was born in this life will not see the light of day in this time line as free will is the most important concept as God made every person capable of taking one's own decisions and if a person doesn't lead a life of righteousness he will be born again into the world . While the concept of heaven and hell is present , as a result of cross over from proto zoroasterian concepts with the concept of 7 janamas after which a person is judged for this deeds by the lord himself . Salvation or heaven or moksha means becoming one with the supreme being that is becoming a part of god ie Ahambrahmasmi which is a concept of Rigveda of our timeline remains a important concept in this time line also . As for hell well there is nothing much to say other than its hell.

While being Monotheistic the hinduism of this time line also has a concept of Demi gods that is souls of great individuals who on their death earn super natural powers but are not god . This is not a vedic Aryan concept and strictly speaking a Dravidian concept as is the case in our time line. Demi gods can be any person or an object or a natural formation such as an outstanding warrior , a great emperor, a great administrator, a mountain, a river , the sun etc while fire temples are not built for these Demi gods but shrines are build in their honour and prople evoke both the supreme being that is the Brahman and any of these Demi gods in their daily life . While intiallly any individual or object could have been raised to a status of Demi god if the people approve of it . But latter on in history the status of granting the status of Demi god became regulated by the Hindu religious order that is the clearical class of the Hindu faith interfered to preserve their power .

Being Monotheistic has an advantage of having simple religious practices unlike the complex religious practices that characterized the Hindu faith of our time line . The effect of this is there is no Buddhism or Jainism or any other counter religious movements as the main cause of all these movements is the pointless of the Hindu rituals and ceremonies whose meaning had become lost to time by then. A simpler religious ceremonies and better social system will ensure stability at the same time progress

The religious changes have been explained to some extent here and the evolution of Hinduism will be covered in other eras for example in the vedic period when the vedas are composed details of Vedas will be provided and in the changes during the Nanda empire era, the Greek invasion and the introduction of Hellenistic religion into the subcontinent and it's popularity in the indus valley and the Hindu Kush mountains, the Mauryan Empire era when the vedic hinduism reached its zenith , the civil war era when the challenge to the vedic orthodoxy became prominent, the Gupta empire era when the vedic Brahmanism was revived by the Gupta emperors some of whom were religious fanatics introduced the concept of forced conversions and religious persecution of certain religious movements, the prathihara empire which was more like a confederation than a empire they were tolerant towards the people of all faiths and it was during their watch that the Sassanian elite flee to India and the lands between khorasan and Hindu Kush mountains were absorbed, the shansabani the eastern Iranian tribes who in this time line remained Hindu it was during their regin the kings of India took the title shah Shahenshah ud Aryan ya anaryan, the various Turkic dynasty that ruled India from 1256 to 1730 the Turks in this time line some of whom convert to hinduism are usually tolerant in their outlook but some persecuted minority religion, the Maratha empire 1730 to 1905, the republic of India 1905 to present

The social structure

While not much is known about the social structure of the indus valley empire the vedas of this time line goes into depth as to how the new social structure came into being. The king of the Bharatha ,the king of kings of Aryans pratipa knew that the new subjects especially the elites will never reconcile with the vedic Aryans so he together with his samithi ( the elite of the vedic Aryans conferderation) formulated a plan to integrate their newly conquered lands into their empire. While intiallly they did not have plans of converting the people of the indus valley into their faith but latter on in 900 ad as brahmanism became powerful did religious conversion in the indus valley convert to brahmanism but even then majority retained their original faith . The vedas does make vague reference to the faith of the indus valley civilization. The faith described by vedas of this time line tells us that the people of the indus valley followed predominantly proto shaivism and shaktism while a significant minority also adhered to nature worship with host of other gods and goddesses. There were no temples or religious buildings where religious ceremonies were performed as all such ceremonies were performed in their houses or in outdoors.
The vedic Aryans flush in their victory engaged in rape and ,plunder of the inhabitants of the indus valley inhabitants and those particularly hit were the nobility as the military commanders of the vedic Aryans ordered their troops not to rape the ordinary inhabitants of the indus valley but it is documented in the vedas it self that the orders were disobeyed by a few but the orders did not cover plunder so as a result a lot of wealth was plundered from the ordinary citizens
.
The nobility and the family members of the army of the indus valley empire got the worst not only had they content with the death of their husbands fathers and brothers being slayed in the battle field now they had to put up with plunder and rape. It was this that came back to haunt pratipa ,the vedic Aryan emperor as he had to content with a hostile populace but king pratipa was a man of incredible intelligence while the plunder was going on the king emperor tried his best to ensure that no important members of the community are affected thus the traders, merchants, artisans, religious official, civil servants, engineers were safe and the merchandise of the traders were protected and this act of shrewed political calculation on the part of pratipa ensured that he wins the support of these prominent individuals who are essential to the running of the affairs once the dust has been settled .
The lands that once belonged to the indus valley nobility was confiscated and re distributed to the prominent individuals of the Indo Aryan tribes who happen to be prominent military commanders as well . While this does not lead to feudalism as only land is handed out not any legal or administrative powers and these new nobles are liable to pay taxes to the king emperor

The fate of these former noble families is tragic many were given away as wives to the elites of the vedic Aryans while the rest became peasants working in the lands that once belonged to them but some noble families who collaborated with the vedic Aryans were spared .
The caste system is as follows
1 These new land magnets formed the top caste of the society ,the fact that these families held prominent military rank aswell as vast tract of land gave them significant influence only next to the king emperor and his family in politics and latter on the top caste would also include top civil servants of the empire and the super rich of the society who were usually from the trading community and it was not unusual for these individuals and their families to be given the rank of nobility
2 The next in rank were the members of the military and the religious clergy and latter all the members of the civil service who are not belonging to the top rank and men of the books and science
3 The people in third place are the traders , merchants, metal smiths , tenants of the noble farmlands, peasant proprietor of the crown lands
4 The labour class
5 The slaves
While the details of the caste system will be dealt latter but for now let's get back to the indus valley
King emperor pratipa knew a revolt was only a matter of time so he began preparation to meet the revolt and also began to tàke steps to reduce the scale of the revolt
",proudman4lyfe," See, the problem with alt history is that in assuming that one particular thing is different, it sometimes forgets that a lot of the other things have to be different too. At the same time it tries to assume that too many other things would happen as if the change in question didnt happen

&#x200B;

Talking ""what if"" is difficult enough on a small time scale of a few years. When you try to talk about events from 2000 years ago, saying anything with any sense of certainty is foolish. 

&#x200B;

Take the following as an example: 

>The fate of these former noble families is tragic many were given away as wives to the elites of the vedic Aryans while the rest became peasants working in the lands that once belonged to them but some noble families who collaborated with the vedic Aryans were spared .

Why didnt all of them collaborate? Why wives of nobles in particular? Why doesnt whatever wealth they had due to being nobles, allow them to take up important roles in society? 

&#x200B;

I also have a bad tendency to dismiss any such fan fiction in regards to vedic times as something the hindutva types might tell each other to justify their victim complex.",Science/Technology,2018-08-29 09:38:17

This is how falsehoods spread: Smriti Irani on how Fields Medalist Manjul Bhargava teaches math,144,5sygz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5sygz4/this_is_how_falsehoods_spread_smriti_irani_on_how/,103,"Manjul Bhargava is a famous Fields Medalist of Indian origin who teaches at Princeton. His nationality is Canada/US. He was born and brought up there but also visited India on holidays.

Like many other mathematicians he has compared poetry and music to mathematics. He has studied Sanskrit poetry at college level. Here is a quote from him

> ""As a child, I enjoyed studying Sanskrit, Sanskrit poetry and Indian classical music. I saw maths in all these things; that further inspired me to pursue mathematics. When I went to college, I took Sanskrit, a lot of music, computer science and physics, and also mathematics. To me, mathematics was the common thread in all these subjects""

As a lover of Sanskrit language, I know the distance between the statements “Panini’s grammar precedes any formal grammar by two millennia” and “Sanskrit is compulsory to get a job at NASA”. Then there is a rainbow of truths and falsehoods between them.

Here is an excerpt where our Education Minister (then) explains how Bhargava teaches math at princeton (at 1m30s):  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GGkIiZou5I&t=1m30s

> In Princeton, in his class — which is the most famous — is “Mathematics for Non-Mathematicians”. I have had the privilege of having talks with Manjul on many occasions and I know him well. And I asked him — what excites you most about teaching that class. **He said, I teach that class in Sanskrit and poetry from India**, and poetry that my mother got from her house in Jaipur. Now imagine Manjul trying to do the same in India …

Aside: the victimhood continues. She can’t imagine a math/cs professor talking about Panini when teaching BNF etc in an IIT. Imagine!

But more importantly, she is outrightly spreading falsehoods about Bhargava. I have followed his work and also his media appearances for some time. He is very mindful of what he speaks. He can never say something as stupid as “I teach my math class in Sanskrit”.

What does this mean? Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

EDIT: The link to the course in question:  
https://www.math.princeton.edu/undergraduate/course/MAT190

> Topics will include Number Patterns and sequences (2 wks.); Math in music and visual arts (2 wks.); Platonic solids, origami and the math of shapes (1 wk.); The Island of Zeke and other Logic Puzzles (1 wk.); Basic probability questions such as; how likely is it that 2 people in a class of 25 have the same birthday? (2 wks.); Modular arithmetic and prime numbers (3 wks.); Applications to technology, communications codes and cryptography (2 wks.)

Link to full discussion on The New Indian Express channel:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIokmVCl0mg",lallulal," It's called creating a narrative to suit interests. Maybe we could get Mr Bhargava to issue a clarification in this regard?  How can you claim you know better than her on this when you only follow ""Manjul"" on the internet. She actually knows him. Their friendship goes back to their Yale days. /s  After all Yale! > What does this mean? Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

What else can you expect from this drama(literally) queen? Remember she was once a bahu who was a saas once or some bull crap like that.  'member that time when a afternoon TV soap actress was our HRD minister? 

We kept on watching. Like we kept on watching her stupid ass show. In a democracy, people get what they deserve. ""Decimating information"" is totally correct. (2m56s) >What does this mean? Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

I won't be surprised if it's the former.  She don't know anything about Maths and Sanskrit. Chill homies.  > Now imagine Manjul trying to do the same in India …

Don't really understand why people have this Hindu victim complex. When have Hindus ever been stopped from expressing themselves? We have banned beef throughout the country, Sanskrit is available as a third language is almost all schools (both public and private) in North India (compare to Latin in Europe/USA),  Mahabharta and Ramayana plays are a stable around the festive session, extensive books have been written about Indian history especially the Vedic age...

If you're going to claim we invented head transplant or NASA has hired 500 Sanskrit teachers, then of course we ""pseudo intellectuals"" are going to mock you for being an uneducated kulcha warrior. Instead of crying Hindu victim complex, try and educate yourself about our rich history and culture which stands on its own without patently false embellishments.  what else you can expect from a RSS ""poche-wali bai"", .
It's RSS's legacy to put incompetent/unsuited people in higher up positions (like illiterate/retard modi as a PM) so that they can continue to spread their anti-nation/regressive religion ""manuvaad"" .  There is this perception among the Indian *gavaar* that foreigners are superhumans and their systems are beyond Indian comprehension. To even believe that a Math lecture is given in Sanskrit, in America, is so troubling. Even a Sanskrit lecture is not given in Sanskrit these days. Did Panini invent the sandwich press?

Jokes apart, it shouldnt be surprising to any casual student of math that math has its presence in language and music. In fact, music is very uniformly mathematical. There is a whole genre of computer generated music that is made through algorithms. >  Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

First one. 

""Never attribute to malice that which can be suffiiciently explained by stupidity."" >He said, I teach that class in Sanskrit and poetry from India

She probably meant ""... on Sanskrit..."". Otherwise the statement doesn't make any sense. Probably meant he includes topics related to mathematics and sanskrit poetry. See this link: https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140812-the-musical-magical-number-theorist/

> To his delight, he discovered that the rhythms of Sanskrit poetry are highly mathematical. Bhargava is fond of explaining to his students that the ancient Sanskrit poets figured out the number of different rhythms with a given number of beats that can be constructed using combinations of long and short syllables: It’s the corresponding number in what Western mathematicians call the Fibonacci sequence. Even the Sanskrit alphabet has an inherent mathematical structure, Bhargava discovered: Its first 25 consonants form a 5 by 5 array in which one dimension specifies the bodily organ where the sound originates and the other dimension specifies a quality of modulation. “The mathematical aspect excited me,” he said. op lurker here and i am not a mathematician did a simple Google

she is not entirely wrong

https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140812-the-musical-magical-number-theorist/ Is Manjul Bhargava of Bengali roots? I don't see anything remiss here. Smriti Irani does not mean that he teaches Mathematics in Sanskrit medium in the US. Manjul Bhargava does use Sanskrit examples in his lectures and his work.  If you saw, Man who knew Infinity, which was in collaboration with Manjul, you would know that Manjul credits Ramanujan's mathematical inspiration & intuitions for his knowledge of Sanskrit poetry which he heard from his mother in the village temple.

Point is, not many folks know origins of Fibonacci series predates to Sanskrit poetry (by Hemachandra) -- or so claims the person you 'follow' (Manjul).",Science/Technology,2017-02-09 14:40:09
"Yesterday hundreds of 'protestors' attacked army and police units in Pulwama, Kashmir during an encounter with militants enabling three militants to escape.",224,45v01x,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/45v01x/yesterday_hundreds_of_protestors_attacked_army/,389,"While most newspapers and TV channels reported that two civilians were killed in police firing in Pulwama, what they didn't report was that this was because hundreds of protestors from nearby villages attacked the security forces engaged in an encounter with LeT militants.The heavy stone pelting led to injuries to six army and fifteen police personnel.It also helped 2-3 militants to escape with another one was shot dead while he was trying to run away.
While police firing led to death of one protestor there are conflicting reports on whether the woman killed was part of protesters or was she looking at the events from her verandah and was hit by a stray bullet.

>The people were protesting against killing of a militant in an encounter with police and army.
Officials said that police and army cordoned the Kharpora area of Kakapora this afternoon. “Some militants who were walking in a street fired towards the forces which were retaliated, triggering an encounter,” officials said.
“The encounter continued for two hours in which one militant was killed. However three others managed to escape from the spot,” they said.
The killed militant was identified as Adil Ahmad of Banderpora, Pulwama.
“As the encounter was on, hundreds of people from neighbouring villages staged massive protests and pelted stones on the forces in order to help the militants break the cordon,” officials said. The forces fired tear smoke shells and bullets on the protesters, killing a local boy on the spot. He was identified as Danish Farooq Mir son of Farooq Ahmad, resident of RatniporaPulwama. Danish was a student of B Tech in Islamic University of Science and Technology.

>Two youth including a woman were killed and ten other people were injured when security forces fired live ammunition after sections of protesters while chanting pro-azadi slogans turned violent near an encounter site in Jammu and Kashmir’s southern district of Pulwama on Sunday.

>Police said 15 of its men and 6 Army jawans were injured in stone-pelting incidents. Two of the Army jawans were hit in their head in mob attack, it added.

>One suspected Lashkar-e-Tayyaba militant was killed in the brief encounter that took place in a residential area near Gousia School in Astan Mohallah of Kakapora. He has been identified as Adil Ahmed Shergojri, a resident of northern Bandipore district. Two of his accomplices managed to escape taking advantage of chaos created by mob intervention and stone-pelting, officials said.

Sopore, Pulwama(especially Tral),Anantnag and old Srinagar.

Whereas areas like Kupwara, Bandipora and Poonch which see a large number of encounters/infiltration, the population is far less anti India.
Tourist areas like Gulmarg, Pahalgam also have little to no separatist activity. > the woman killed was part of protesters or **was she looking at the events from her verandah** and was hit by a stray bullet.

Looking at a gunfight from verandah? o.O Martyr!  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) This is the sad part about the Kashmir issue which most Indians are not aware of. It can be severely demotivating for soldiers and officers when Kashmiri people do not support them. India will need to engage the people of Kashmir. Every war is not fought with bullets. We need a political solution to the Kashmir issue that is within the framework of Indian constitution, and gives a feeling of self-rule and freedom to Kashmiri people. There are solutions possible: Like Scotland and England, and Ireland and England. Why not give people some more autonomy and let the Indian Army just rule the borders?  [removed] So, why don't these guys carry a couple cameras to ID these fuckers? When the people go bat-shit insane and start protesting, GoI should put that video up on Youtube or something and use social media to get the counter that it needs. 

Use social media and technology in such cases where it can be easily used. Imagine if this same scenario happened anywhere but in Kashmir. Hundreds of protestors throw stones at the army and and the police, who kill two civilians during this. This commotion allows a few anti-government militants/terrorists/whatever to get away.

Imagine if this happened in China. Or British India. Or America. Or anywhere else on the globe. It would be seen as a clear indictment of government oppression and a sign of the people's discontent with it. If you can justify shit like this, you can justify Tiananmen Square.

People have the right to govern themselves, and yes, that includes the right to live in an Islamic shithole if they want. Indians behave as if they have some ""Brown man's burden"" to bring their version of civilisation to them, when these people clearly don't want it.  [deleted]",Science/Technology,2016-02-15 13:27:48

I kid you not, lot of your career advancement depends on how you communication and how you network.  

For a lot of you it may be natural. But introverts like me find it extremely hard. The shabby origins of all social constructs like money, credit, gender roles, societal norms, etc. [deleted] Basics like how to fill a check, how to handle things at banks, basic law, human rights, etiquettes, basic social behavior, traffic rules, money management etc. Just basic things that every person must know.

P.S - one of the girl ( 21 yrs old ) in my class  doesn't know how to fill check or do any kind of cash withdrawl or deposit in bank. -More importance to liberal arts! highly relevant in society. But parents only root for 'science' or 'commerce' for their kids. fuck those!

-kids should be made aware of basic economics like insurance/banking/income tax laws etc. before they reach adulthood.

-Moral Science till 10th grade atleast. 

-Environmental Science till 10th grade atleast.  personal finance  Basic psychology. I see a lot of people have cringeworthy interactions and feel a fundamental understanding of human psychology would have made things run a lot smoother. I feel having gotten to delve into it a bit has helped hone my interactions with loved ones, especially.

Sex education is the other. Teenagers need to be assured the raging hormones in their system is normal. Even in med school the topic isn't touched upon much. I still know way too many girls who shriek at the thought of boys/men watching porn, or masturbating, or even having sexual needs. No, no, those who do all that are fringe elements. Forget about women, that's not even natural according to them. It's understandable to have such views at 13, but when even at 25 you stay that ill-informed, that just shows the pressing need to insert sex education somewhere along the way. Logic. Fucking hell login would have gone a long way in fixing majority of the issues we face.  Statistics. 

I am a firm believer that statistics should be taught in depth before even introducing calculus. 

A strong statistical foundation is paramount in making sense of the world. Not many people, if any use calculus in a concious, meaningful way in their lives. However, statistics and probability, is used daily. It is also a lot of fun, it is the mathematics of gambling and games, of analyzing trends and predicting the future. 

Strong statistical knowledge also helps individuals make sense of the news where studies are reported. Statistical literacy allows people to see what the bullshit their politicians peddle is.  Taxation, Personal finance LPTs. Taxation and investing or at least basic finance. Shit is a bitch to learn on your own.  Basic law and the functioning of the judicial system Economics Philosophy and critical thinking. The science and maths portion is well covered. At least in theory. I struggle a lot sometimes in analyzing some issues. The more I think about such issues, the more I get confused. If they could have taught me critically analyzing a logic or argument, I would have save so much time in learning that.  Doing your taxes and cooking. 

These are essential life skills. Teaching spoken english. A lot of focus was only on learning grammar and just scoring in exams.  We need to impart that Education does not end with school/college (especially in this internet age). I support the idea of [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) which is more student-centric and allows self-paced learning. Geography Better calculus, and history and philosophy behind the subject Logical reasoning and critical thinking skills are desperately required in this country along with sex education. We're a country that has a great history with the performing arts so we should be teaching that too.  real life communicatuon skills , more focus on writing skills rather than mugging literature , touch typing Fact checking ( aka how not to believe every watsapp forward ).  - Being street smart

Rant: Are we condemned to being ignorant?,234,4uz3ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4uz3ms/rant_are_we_condemned_to_being_ignorant/,121,"I've been wanting to write this for a *long* time but somehow haven't been able to make time to sit and pen it down. This will be long, so please bear with me. 


Many months back, I came across this [interview](http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/aatish-taseer-india-is-semi-literate-and-chetan-bhagat-is-the-best-it-can-do/20150205.htm) with Aatish Taseer, where he calls India a ""semi-literate"" country. I was quite baffled then, by his words. Why would someone with such deep connections to India make such a disparaging comment on its citizens? Its true significance has finally hit me and it's making me sad.

We're a country of a billion people with few opportunities and deep contrasts. However instead of trying to bridge the divide, mend the fracture and soothe the pain, we keep insisting on magnifying the gap and adding salt to the wounds. 

How did we become so politically incorrect as a nation? How did we let bigotry define us to such a large extent? How did we let education fail us?

As Indians, our single goal as kids has been reduced to clearing entrance exams without realising the kind of studies that we're getting involved in, to get there. We're not broadening our minds to ideas, we're not enhancing our understanding of ourselves, we're not experimenting with out of the box ideas on science and technology. No. As 15-16 year old kids, we're solving questions. Recognising patterns. Trying to understand the examiner's psyche in order to get the most questions correct, sometimes spending months and even years in those hallowed halls they call coaching institutes. If you manage to set aside all the hoopla around coaching institutions, they're merely *cram schools*. Even our neighbouring China has them. But we as kids, and more importantly our parents, don't want to be told of that. Because deep down, that term *cram school* conflicts with our idea of what education should be all about. I, like many millions, was also a victim of this. Yes, I made it though. But I'm under no illusion about exactly what I've achieved. I've crammed and smarted my way through entrance exams by recognising patterns and understanding ""important concepts"" without ever learning to think for myself.

And then the results are in front of us to see. This [video](https://youtu.be/Rfw5nQy5_pw) popped up on the front page of my YouTube yesterday and I ended up watching it. One of the kids here appears to be incredibly cocky about what he thinks of people who weren't able to qualify for IIT. I don't blame the guy, maybe a few years back I'd have behaved the same way. But he exposes how limited our understanding is, of education. Our entrance exams, be it medical or engineering, are tough *because* we have such a huge population. That and because the number of institutions of repute (even though the IITs don't even rank among the very best institutes in the world) in this country is embarrassingly minuscule. 

College education is a similar tragedy. Teachers merely teach. Students merely attend classes. Teachers get promoted after a few years, students graduate every year. The teachers have no incentive to teach, they don't get promoted because of the performance of their students, they don't get recognition for using exemplary methods of teaching. And yet they expect students to do well, grasp concepts and become contributors to the society, magically. Our respect for teachers in this country runs deep. Unfortunately, that blinds us to the gross callousness with which most of them do their *jobs*. As a result, we graduate not as informed educated citizens, capable of engaging with a wide range of people on a variety of topics, but as robots. Robots capable of working efficiently, without having the ability to position us in the grand scheme of things, without having the ability to question and without having a worldview. 

But enough about institutional education. What about how we think? Do we even know *how* to think? Are we tolerant enough and respectful enough to differences of opinion? Are we accommodative enough? Do we know our history? Do we know who we are as a country? 

In the comments section of the same video I shared, you'll see many plainly abusive comments about SC STs made without realising how bigoted they sound. The hatred for the lower castes is clear. The hatred, often, isn't even about reservations. It's about a group of people who we think don't deserve to be where they are, or more specifically, where they are being allowed to go. How oblivious, how shallow and how deeply rotten do we have to be, to pick on the weakest section of the society, the SC STs?

The tragedy is not that we are bigots. The tragedy is how we *fail to recognise* how bigoted we are. The tragedy is not that we are inherently casteist as a society. The tragedy is that we constantly *fail to recognise* how casteist we are as a society. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ1EgsRT1zk), an interview by Ravish Kumar of an African student, exposes just how limited our understanding is of race. He is referred to as a ""gorilla"" in nowhere else but the capital city of the country. How can we as a nation, as a colonised nation in the past, not empathise with Africans? How can we be racist to a group of people who were treated the same way as we were by colonial powers of the day? In other words, how deeply has our education system failed us, that we have lost the ability to recognise our shared history?

If you go through comments on Twitter (and no I don't mean just the hateful comments directed towards a particular group of people), you'll realise how incredibly easy we find ourselves to be insensitive, even when we're not hiding under the hood of anonymity. An Indian woman, from a religious minority, was rescued by the government from a foreign country, in an astonishing attempt that brought out in me a deep sense of respect for government officers and diplomats. And then I read disparaging comments about her family on Twitter on the same day, by religious nut jobs. Add to that the hegemony, a certain group of people hold in our society, and the whole thing becomes scary. 

Bigotry and hatred, borne out of ignorance and pure cluelessness, have become a disease. And I will not even mention Facebook here because that is a cesspool of hideous ideas. Even some of my friends and colleagues, who I've known for a long time, have in many cases become absolute hypocrites, espousing hatred towards the disadvantaged and more importantly, towards the *different*. It's not about conflicting ideas of conservatism and liberalism. Its not even about the right and the left. It's about basic decency and having a semblance of understanding about our position as Indians in the world.

I do not excuse myself of this prejudice, of course. Having become a product of this system, I've also become a victim of the same kind of regressive thought processes that haunt many. May we all strive to, at least, *recognise* this, and if possible, mend our ways. 

We deserve better compatriots. Our children deserve better peers. And most importantly, this country deserves better citizens.

(Edit: Added missing hyperlinks)

(Thanks for the gold kind sir/madam)",randompersonthrowawa," To get a country out of ignorance, we need a ""Book Reading revolution"" in the country. Please make your friends read a lot of books, long essays etc., whenever you meet a new person, ask them about their favorite books or podcasts.

We need a culture where things we do are based on reason & evidence rather than religion and personal politics. Just spread knowledge to as many as possible.

 Ignorance is an option people choose. In an age of information you just can't be ignorant until you conveniently choose so. People develop a belief and stick to it and when the truth hits them hard, most of them retaliate with meaningless ""what about.."" shit rather than accepting it and change. Our education system is crap, no doubt about it. It does not explain the nature of people though. I've met enough people who are bright but do support caste system. We are a what our experiences in life make us and that's why I loved this bit

>We deserve better compatriots. Our children deserve better peers.

Nice rant. There have been quite some thought provoking issues raised here.
Education, for instance has been criticised for far too long. I do believe there's a need for it change and get better. But will bringing a few structural or conceptual changes help? I highly doubt so. We have been so used to taming the system(as mentioned in the article) that we will find an easy way out. There needs to be a revolution all together that has to start from the central government and trickle down to the masses. The problem remains the same, resources. In a country like India where poverty is still a major concern, can we afford to revolutionise and bring in a  system that improves thinking and gives less importance to the cramming regime that has been running(the primary aim is still employment and not the broader vision of an ideal national). The resources and the sheer volume of population that comes with the country are too disproportionate. Maybe few decades down the line, we can. Another solution can be a government making one area (like education, health, manufacture etc) the key of their five year regime and focus on uplifting those domains one by one. (It'll always be difficult where revenue generation methods for the government are fairly limited and only a fraction pays the direct taxes).
But their is no two opinions on bigotry. We are and shall continue to be hypocrites. As children we learn ""Saare jahaan se achaa"", but the bitter fact is we are far from that. Governments, bureaucrats and the public are so self involved in what shows, that they forget what matters. We preach Vasudhaev Kutumbakam and yet commit racial atrocities based on religion, caste, colour, sex, dressing sense(the list can go on). The bigotry has been so deeply embedded into the Indian psyche that it can only be eradicated substantially. Since their can not be a jurisdiction which can enforce it, the leaders(celebrities who command mass support) need to take charge and engrave it in minds of people. Every caste based issue needs to be rejected by the people that show, to start with, and it needs to be an aggressive cry. We need to force rulers to act and the subjects to think on what matters and what discussion shall benefit the society as a whole and not a person or a small group. This was a *very* well written post.

I (24F) have led a slightly off beat life. As a child my parents didn't expect a lot from me apart from good grades which too stopped after 10th, because I told them I don't care anymore. Mom wasn't disinterested in me, she just let me be. Dad was more interested in making my elder brother an engineer (he ran off after flunking the first year, came back and got into animation, is fairly successful now in the US). I studied my ass off in 9th and 10th and have suffering from the ill effects it has had on my health ever since. I got great marks which was *meh* for me. After 12th, I decided I didn't want to be an engineer despite scoring decent marks and loving CS. I went for English (H) in a good college in Delhi, got decent enough grades, stopped giving a dime for what others got or what others thought about me. My parents let me be. They didn't ask for my marks and I didn't tell them either. Then I stayed at home for a year, tried my hand at Applied Psychology (MA) because I have a personal connection with mental illness and I know how much a mentally 'disabled' person has to suffer in our country because of the lack of empathy and information about it. Didn't like the college and four months later, applied for MA in Development at a new university in Bangalore and got through. I spent the two most enriching years of my life there. I specialised in Sustainability. With this came a desire for equality between classes, castes, genders. A hatred for what neolibralism is doing to people and our country and for those who rush towards high paying (with blood money), division creating jobs with a higher footprint and disregard for what their life styles are doing to the people and this planet. I also know now how to weed out the real NGOs from others and unfortunately, most of those are headed by people very much into blood money who think for instance, that an iPad can solve poverty issues (IT4Dev for people who know this lingo). Personal opinion.

Why am I telling you all this? Because, as of now, I have no job, no opportunities that I find honest and ethical enough and am currently mooching off my father's money (government employee but who says the government doesn't deal in blood money). I am desperate as I look for the right place to work at. Sure, I teach underprivileged kids who want to learn and practice sustainable living and don't personally indulge in consumerism, but everyone knows that it doesn't do jack. In my desperation for a job that pays me enough to stand on my own two feet, I have now begun looking at companies that support neolibralism and have ecologically and socially unsustainable practices. I can no longer sit and judge. I know what I'm getting into but I don't know any other way. I am a hypocrite, so to speak.

This is how the real world forces people like me to swim with the current. Because although I want a paradigm shift, I know I'll have to live a pauper's life and alienate myself even more to stay true to what I believe is right. I used to look down at people like me, now I am one of them because I don't have an answer. For a country to be enlightened from ignorance we need a functioning society, today India has too many societal problems like Overpopulation, Crumbling cities, Gender discrimination and violence, Malnutrition, bad education system etc.,

unless we stabilize these problems it's hard to get huge overpopulated like ours out of ignorance. You need a TLDR

What makes you frustrated? You cannot make 1+ billion people open minded and prejudice-free; there will always be people thinking like that. Its not about education; we learn from our environment as well. My guess; thats where most prejudice come from.

Logic and critique does not win convince people on these as well; have you forgotten the massive wave of 'whataboutism' killing arguments. I can always raise the culture card and that how ancient our civilizations is thus whatever exists works as it survived...

Who does curriculum and education system? Do you not think an informed citizenry is dangerous for the political class?

Be the change is the only real way; maybe influence your close ones.

FInally; when brexit can happen in a supposedly (and i am assuming here) more educated country; or the trump campaign doing well in the only superpower of the world; do you really think we can get rid of the shit we have? Very well written, totally agree with you. Sad but true :/ The rant is a little too big for me to finish reading it, but I will just add my mini-rant here:

What you say about students being forced into some kind of entrance exam mode is one of the main problems.

I feel our entire current generation has entered some kind of entrance exam rate race and has neglected everything else. 

For a country of 1.2 billion people, our contribution to world culture, music, art etc is abysmal. We atleast used to have some great internationally acclaimed musicians. Pandit Ravishankar was one of the biggest musicians in the world, he used to be george harrison's guru (george harrison was the guitarist for the beatles!) He was like a guru for the fucking Beatles! Who in this generation is poised to step into that level? Who is the next zakhir hussain? AR Rahman is the only highly talented musicians left. Are there any famous indian painters/ artists? 

Everyone who says ""Indian culture is great!!"", when asked about it, give examples from 200 years back. What is happening right now? What about our culture? 

Our schooling is so fucked up, we do not let the kids pursue any of these things as there isnt much money in it unless you make it big. Bollywood is partly to blame. Bollywood, being such a big movie industry has descended into a bunch of old men making shitty movies, giving each other awards. It is very hard for a musician, actor without connections to rise up. So you either have to become super successful or there is barely any money.

I was listening to some korean pianists, chinese musicians etc it feels like these countries have an overall growth with economic and cultural might and we are in some kind of a rush to get somehwere but dont know where. While I agree with you on most points, I do hold certain reservations - I think most Indians on the internet are from urban areas and they have little to no experience with caste based bigotry. Sure, They understand economic differences but caste doesn't mean the same thing in cities. I think it's unfair to call them out for something they intuitively don't understand. You say that the pivotal problem is that they ""fail to recognize"" but that is kinda inconsequential because the people who do practice bigotry recognize and it practice it none the less.   Firstly, well written. You make excellent points on all accounts. However, as some here have pointed out you may want to think about a summary. Anyway, regarding the education thing I couldn't agree more. The tragedy is that we ""learn so much"" in the indian education system and yet it baffles me how we still know so little. As an example, while I was enrolled in my master's in computer science program in the u.s. (stereotype I know) there were several other fellow  Indian students in my classes. It pissed me off when I realized that out of the hundreds of desi students less than ten actually knew how to program, the basics of computer science, data structures, algorithms etc. How is it possible that a person supposedly holding a bachelors degree in computer science from India knows less than an American freshman when it comes to actually applying their knowledge and can't seem to pass a test or assignment unless they cheat (which is a whole other thing giving us a bad name in foreign universities ) ? To me this is perhaps one of the biggest downfalls of our education system and proof that our educational system is pretty shit. You cram all this information, write countless exams, attend countless tuitions and coaching classes yet the second you have to apply your knowledge you are utterly useless! This is a very worrying trend. And not something that is lost on American professors. The sad thing is all of us end up getting a bad name due to it and there is a growing sentiment (at least in certain segments of the American work force ) that Indian programmers are not worth their salt. Which is really disappointing. I know this is not related to the social side effects of a shitty education system which you have brought up, but it is still worrying that the system is so bad. Regarding the social /cultural issues, most of us probably don't need to look far to hear an older Indian person say how ""once upon a time"" our culture was so great and accomplished things/had knowledge  that the western world only learned later. This is such a bullshit argument and a cop out. Sure, it may have been great once but it sure as shit isn't anymore and hasn't been for a long time. Why don't we have the collective balls to just admit this and address the problem instead of looking at the past and saying we were great back then? That accomplishes nothing. Yet we have the tendency to criticise western countries as being morally corrupt. Which is so hypocritical considering we have systemic issues with racism, sexism, violence against women, corruption ... the list goes on. > How oblivious, how shallow and how deeply rotten do be have to be to pick on the weakest section of the society, the SC STs?

Someone gets it.  This was very well written and I agree with everything :)

Solution cannot be simple, but I think less population and more education is the way forward. In a society where access to resources and opportunity is low, it makes perfect ""rational"" sense for the educational system to settle in the state it currently is in. India has very few educational institutions, right from schools up to the Universities, where you can get some semblance of a good education. Factor into it the social inequalities, and it becomes apparent that it is nearly impossible for us to have a subjective/non-quantitative entrance system. In fact, the JEE might be the only way a student from some rural backwaters can compete with someone who grew up in the more affluent parts of the country . As such, unless access to socio-economic opportunities and resources is made available to a wider population, alternative approaches to education might not work out well I think the root of the problem is the nature of current politics. You blame teachers by saying they ""merely teach"". May be you are suggesting that they work towards expanding their minds with knowledge.

But let me ask you something. What is the job of a politician? The job of a politician is to get their party elected in the next election. Members of opposing party think about playing political games that could win them the next election. While ruling party think about serving to the whims of the majorities, so that they can remain in power. Nowhere in the life of a politician, does he need to think of moving the country forward. It is always the next election. When politicians speak to masses, it is always to ridicule the opposition and never to provoke thought. So, you see, the job of a politician has been reduced to merely aid in winning of elections. I think a lot of the things wrong with the country can be linked to this simple fact. Now, this is more or less same all over the world, hence the problems you mention are more or less problems of the whole world. The thing is, society is controlled by Netas. That includes education and human development, or rampant ignorance/racism and other ills on the same plate.

Netas, glorious Indian politicians, are the most feral savages to have been born in human history. They are mostly illiterate, unproductive and have zero knowledge about how world works after 1950s.

...And they have been given all the power over Indian people. They keep holding us back. Op this is somethong i have felt for a long time, you have pulled those ferling put and have made eloquent post of it here. Awrsome post op.  To answer your question in the title - yep, as that is what the powers that be have intended for us. A small group of people control EVERYTHING in this world - do you think they want us to wake up and start asking questions?

The infamous robber baron John Rockefeller once said - ""I want a nation of workers, not thinkers.""

The education system serves as a mere conveyor belt for people to take the path of least resistance to get a job which offers a monthly salary.

It doesn't end there.

Capitalism has successfully moulded culture and has us perennially chasing things. Unless people wake up and realize that hedonism and materialism aren't the key to contentment, they will continue to walk in the dark.

Nice rant btw. OP, nothing can be done, India is a decaying civilization. Only a civilizational reboot will do. That will be possible with world war 3 or climate change catastrophe.  tl dr please.
 [deleted] Well Put and nicely written. 


We Indians as a society are more prone & concerned about ""what this society thinks"" than ""What I actually think"". 


Like horde of Sheep following, we have been practicing casual racism & casteism for yrs. We actually don't think at once that we're hurting others feelings. But we do all precautions to make sure that doesn't happen to us.  You said nothing new, so I'll gracefully ignore the rant and move on. How do you fix it?
The problem with the Don Quixote of this world is that even though their life and work make an inspiring story, but it has little or no effect on the society.
We will perhaps always lack decency in this world. I agree with you on most parts. But, 

`they don't get promoted because of the performance of their students`.This is how everybody in your class becomes a ""champion"". Only hope is to raise your kids properly. Now the problem is everyone thinks their way is the proper. Arnab, you don't need to do this, no one is taking your show away. Mummy will shoo Barkha away. TL DR; He is trying to say we are hypocrites, we don't have patience, we assume that we are always right without hearing and understanding what the other person is trying to say and we are bunch of bigots. We ourselves are racist and we point finger at the world for being racist towards us. In spite of having billion plus people we don't have top class universities and still go abroad for further education. We have limited opportunities in every field and to top it the reservation system. We being a colony of the British for more then 200 years haven't improved in our thought process. We need to change our attitude, the way we look at the world and at other people. We should have little or no hatred towards other people irrespective of their caste, creed, race, religion etc. We need to become better citizen of India and more importantly of the world. we are like this only.

Is Indian Meteorological Department really incompetent?,45,6z9gmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6z9gmn/is_indian_meteorological_department_really/,15,"This is an excerpt from D Sivananda Pai's (Head of climate prediction at IMD) interview published in Indian Express.
[Link](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/meteorological-predictions-are-not-perfect-we-never-claim-that-it-is-a-science-we-do-our-best-d-sivananda-pai-imd/) 


**On unreliable forecasts from IMD**
>- I admit that meteorological predictions are not perfect. We never claim that we are 100 per cent right. It is a science and we do the best we can. 
- Rainfall is never equally distributed throughout the city. So, generally, forecasting the exact rainfall value over a particular location is not possible. For eg. in case of recent rains in Mumbai, the regional variation was so high that within the city itself, Dharavi recorded 56 cm of rainfall, Santacruz 33 cm and Colaba about 10 cm 
- Nature is not deterministic. It is a chaotic system. A high degree of randomness prevails and even the best of models cannot eliminate this uncertainty.
- Nature does not behave in the same manner every time, there will still be some discrepancy between the model result and actual event. We need to be aware of 
 these inherent limitations.


**On comparison with more accurate forecasts in other countries**
>- I would say it is only partially correct. We give very accurate forecasts for cyclones. Other countries have more accurate forecasts over short-range, day-to-day variation, because of radar coverage and lesser uncertainties in weather systems. However, our extended range and seasonal forecasts are much better than them.
- There is a difference in weather events in other countries and India. England lies in an extra-tropical region. Their weather is dictated by frontal systems which are much more stable and predictable. India, on the other hand, is in the tropical belt. There is more randomness in weather events.
- In the US or Europe, their entire area is tracked by radars. It gives them better short-range forecasts. We don’t have radars that  continuously monitor every region because it wasn’t considered very cost-effective. We need 30-40 more Doppler Radars. We are in the process of getting them. Once we have more radars, our short-range forecasts will also improve. But our cyclone forecast is one of the best in the world. 


**On the availability of best technology**
>- We now have a very good computer system, which will be further upgraded this December. We have very good weather models. Many of our IMD officials are in charge of technical committees at the WMO. I am myself chairing a technical team at the WMO which provides regional climate outlook. If you are not the best, you would not be picked up for these jobs. 
- India is, and now it is globally acknowledged, at the same level as developed countries in weather forecasting.
- There are many other issues that apply to meteorology in general like our data-collecting capability over oceans is not very good. Even on land, it is difficult to get data from certain areas such as Afghanistan


**IMD on world front**
>- People in the WMO take India as the natural leader in meteorology in this part of the world. Our scientists are very well respected.
- India, being the natural leader, was asked not just to prepare forecasts for South Asia but also to train other countries in the region.


",souled_monk," What makes you feel they're incompetent. The guy is the head of the organization, and it seems like these statements wouldn't be too difficult to prove otherwise.   You need really powerful computers to run these kind of workload. These may not be available at their disposal.  Tl;dr
They are competent; do the best they can with limited resources...
Forecasting climate is very difficult and forecast are made for regions/clusters not for small areas... hence sometimes happens that they forecast heavy rain and its sunny outside your house --- you get the idea Predicting weather is very difficult as currently we don't have any formula which we can apply to get the final values.

[NP] Indians who think 'humanities are dumb' - how much of Humanities Literature have you actually read?,32,642h30,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/642h30/np_indians_who_think_humanities_are_dumb_how_much/,52,"I'm genuinely curious about this because I have seen this view repeated in too many places. I've always thought the Physical Sciences were just a field that required long, mindless hours of practising formulas, so I avoided this mindless drudgery to focus on greater ideas, greater thoughts of Human Existential Dilemma. But I found my impressions of physical sciences was wrong. There is a lot of intellect that is required for the theoretical sciences - especially when I began to learn about the transitions from Newtonian to Einsteinian to Quantum Mechanical views of the world.

I realised that Science requires a lot of depth of thought, imagination and leaps of logic, much like Philosophy and especially, metaphysical thought. To be a great Scientist, one needs to be more than just a mindless ratte-baaz. My respect for scientists has grown.

This understanding has come to me after developing an interest for 'Science'. 

My question is: there is a particular stereotype about Indians being service providers to the world, we are hardly ever recognised as idea producers. I believe that to create great ideas, you need a great mind. The ideal for this is someone like Da Vinci, or even Steve Jobs. These are the kind of people who straddle worlds between technology and art. I find that Indian 'technologists' are very uni-dimensional. I'm hardly ever intrigued by ideas presented by a Nandan Nilekani for example, as opposed to a Shashi Tharoor. Indians, of course, are very intelligent and hard workers. I would hope though that we started engaging with different, compartmentalised streams too - to grow, to become greater. We need to engage beyond disciplinary boundaries because all they do is reduce us into commercial products who provide the corporate machine with rats for the race. To be Entrepreneurs, idea makers, we need to develop a wider, deeper intellect.

I'm curious: what do you think about my views?",Sykik165," This is exactly why the IITs started offering courses in Humanities - so that the Engineering crowd can interact with students pursuing degrees in other disciplines, and their minds can expaaaaaaaaaand. People in India think it is dumb because you don't make a lot of money if you have a career in humanities. Most of India is poor and their primary objective is to come out of it. Anything that does not help you achieve this is dumb as per them. In Indian context, a lot of philosophy and it's discussion have significant religious or spiritual undertones to it. It's not that people look down on humanities, it's just that it's not viewed as viable career options.
You talk of Da Vinci or Existentialism but how do you expect people to relate and discuss with foreign personalities  and concepts ?

In Hindi heartland or villages a lot of these philosophical discussions and debates take form of shayris, vyangya, vakhya which other that deep philosophical understanding and questioning requires thorough understanding of language too.

I support humanities education especially in language and religious studies. I hope there is investment in it's studying and record-keeping  >I avoided this mindless drudgery to focus on greater ideas, greater thoughts of Human Existential Dilemma.

Since when has humanities been seen as a greater intellectual pursuit than physical sciences? I've read quite a bit of philosophy and it's only the woo-woo types who believe this. 

But to answer your question, from what I've heard and seen, humanities is generally taught terribly. Even philosophy as a science gives way too much leeway for bad ideas to fester because of subjectivity and bad philosophers are not ostracized by the community. It lacks the self correcting mechanism of empirical sciences and serves as a pointless thought exercise which addresses no real purpose in the society other than producing pretentious condescending philosophy grads. 

> I'm hardly ever intrigued by ideas presented by a Nandan Nilekani for example, as opposed to a Shashi Tharoor

Case in point this statement. Have you ever considered that this could be because you are not capable of fully understanding the views of 'uni-dimensional' technologists? Philosophy or liberal arts without any 
understanding of physical sciences will not get you any closer to understanding or solving the human existential dread. 

So as long as humanities is taught without any focus on logical and critical thinking, it will continue to be perceived as 'dumb' or 'pointless' by others. 


 I have followed Xavier's BA Lit course for all three years, all readings, exams, papers, etc.. Read philosophy and eco besides, as much as I could get my hands on in libraries and friends' shelves.

Let me tell you, it's all masturbatory bullshit.

The sequence of learnings that finally unraveled Existence for me were: atheism, Stoicism, Upanishads, Gita, and paleo-anthropology in that order.

You may substitute some with a near cousin and perhaps reach the same conclusion. I certainly don't have the sum total all knowledge, but enough that there are few questions I haven't discovered. (You start thinking in terms of questions instead of answers.) Ask me anything Anything that teaches logic is fine by me. Learn painting in your own bloody time. Humanities is limited to learning dates and names of rulers in History by rote, random rivers and places on a map in Geography, etc IMO

"Hi, /r/India! TRAI wants to know how we can hold telecom operators accountable for mobile data speeds. Here's how you can make your voice heard.",219,6esgm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6esgm8/hi_rindia_trai_wants_to_know_how_we_can_hold/,11,"Firstly, here is the consultation paper: [Consultation Paper on Data Speed Under Wireless Broadband Plans](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf) [PDF]

###**What is this?**

TRAI wants to know **how mobile Internet providers should be held more accountable for the data speeds they advertise.** Mobile data speeds are much more variable and unpredictable than fixed-line broadband connections, so TRAI is looking at whether they should make a 'label' from telcos mandatory that specifies what kind of speeds customers should expect from their connections. TRAI also wants to know what kind of tech they can use to *measure* how fast telcos' connections actually are for their subscribers.

###**Sounds great! How do I send in my ideas?**

First of all, take a deep breath. Telcos are going to have a really long answer to this consultation, and their lobbying will be polished and elaborate -- they do **not want to be regulated.** If you are a concerned citizen, you need to make your voice *heard*, not just *counted.*

Telecom consultation filings are not rocket science. You can send in a good and insightful response, and it won't take you more than an hour or two. Remember, your response **will be read**, and this TRAI administration leans towards consumers. 

**Read the consultation paper.** [Here's the link again](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf). Read it fully, it's only 30 pages long, and gives you enough context and information to be able to answer the questions.

**Draft a response.** This should not take you very long. You have a month to send a response in, so just spend a couple days collating all the points you want to mention in your response, order them under subheads, and work them into your answers to each question.

Make a PDF or Word Document of your response and email it to **kapilhanda@trai.gov.in**.

###**Cool! What's the deadline?**

The deadline is **29th June**. You can email TRAI and ask them to extend this deadline if you feel that this time is not adequate, and they usually do extend deadlines upon request. But try and get in on this right as telcos do, because TRAI may read responses as and when they ge them.

The deadline for **counter-comments**, which is an ***equally important stage***, if not more, where you have to counter arguments made by other responders, is **13th July**. 

###**What are the questions?**

Here are the questions TRAI wants you to answer. (emphasis all mine; text slightly edited for clarity). If you feel like you don't know the context for some of these questions, check the consultation paper; it will probably answer any questions you might have about the existing regulatory framework that telcos face.

Q1: Is the information on wireless broadband [mobile internet] speeds currently available to consumers *transparent enough* to help them make informed choices?

Q2: If it is difficult [for telcos] to commit to a minimum download speed, then could an
average speed be specified by service providers? What should
be the parameters for calculating this average speed?

Q3: What changes can be brought about to the *existing framework* on
wireless broadband tariff plans to encourage better transparency
and comparison between plans offered by different service
providers?

Q4: Is there a need to *include or delete* any of the *QoS parameters*
and/or revise any of the benchmarks currently stipulated in the
Regulations?

Q5: Should disclosure of *average network performance* over a period
of time or at peak times including through broadband facts/labels
be made *mandatory*?

Q6: Should standard application/websites be identified for mandating
comparable disclosures about network speeds?

Q7: What are the products/technologies that can be used to measure
actual end-user experience on mobile broadband networks? At
what level should the measurements take place (e.g., on the 
device, network node)?

Q8: *Are there any legal, security, privacy or data sensitivity issues
with collecting device level data?*

a) If so, how can these issues be addressed?  
b) Do these issues create a challenge for the adoption of any
measurement tools?

Q9: What measures can be taken to *increase awareness among
consumers* about wireless broadband speeds, availability of
various technological tools to monitor them and any potential
concerns that may arise in the process?

Q10: Any other issue related to the matter of Consultation.

Remember, if there's something that you think this consultation paper missed out on, include it in response to question 10.",shadowbannedguy1," TRAI is the only one who thinks public opinion matters in india It seems this paper only talks about wireless plans, but I see something very disturbing in wired plans (especially of local ISPs) these days.

These guys promise 50/100 Mbps, and you do get the advertised speed upto their gateway. But speeds to actual servers on the internet are highly varied - domestic servers and those with a peering agreement perform very well but random websites do not.

You can't raise a regular complaint because _saar see you are getting 50 Mbps_ and good luck trying to get such a complex idea through the skulls of CSAs. Can someone provide a common draft that we can send quickly? Just like net neutrality one?

Spoiler Alert! Only for people who have watched it or don't care if they ever watch it - My Analytical Review of the movie Dunkirk.,25,719nda,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/719nda/spoiler_alert_only_for_people_who_have_watched_it/,12,"While Inception and interstellar, though fascinating, were unrealistic and defied all rules of science, mathematics and common sense, Dunkirk, is Christopher Nolan's best movie yet. I recently watched it and I wanted to key my thoughts down and see what else people may have gleaned from the movie. I gleaned something that pertains to India-China standoff(s) among other things.

So, basically, Dunkirk is about 400,000 men, British and French, stranded in enemy territory in WW2. With the enemy closing in from all sides, the British are waiting for rescue to get back to Britain which is visible across the channel from Dunkirk Situated in France. That's basically it. However, the movie spans on much more and the unique Nolan mind-wrangling makes it more interesting than the simple premise stated above.

The movie begins with a staggered timeline. It follows the pilots of the Spitfires over a 40-minute long journey to Dunkirk while it follows the struggle of the 3 soldiers with the ships and in water in trying to escape from the beach for days. It even ends with a staggered timeline following the seamen and soldiers days after the incident while following the pilot only minutes after the climax. IMO, apart from trying to capture the chaos of war, this reflects on two things - 1. The British Navy and Army have existed for hundreds of years while airforce is relatively new. It may also be symbolic of the fact that there are nations that have existed forever and they will continue to exist forever even in the face of new ones that may come up. 2. The advent of new technology makes us dependent on it. We see how dive bombers keep killing thousands and sinking rescue destroyers and the soldiers keep asking ""where is the airforce?"".

Next, it focuses on the butterfly effect. Farrier's fuel gauge is broken and he is given the choice to turn back but he chooses to stay the course and ends up saving the entire rescue. If he had just chosen to turn back, all the planes he shot down wouldn't have been shot and the rescue may not have taken place or been as effective.       
Similarly, Tommy tagged ""Gibson"" along who ends up saving their lives by opening the door on the ship sinking because of the torpedo. 

We also see that the massive and powerful destroyers are bombed by the enemy and are unable to rescue the stranded soldiers, a feat that is accomplished by civilian boats. This, to me, highlights the fact that it is not the military might of a country but the spirit of its people that wins wars - something Winston Churchill had alluded to in one of his addresses to the nation. Also, it tries to present that one should not underestimate small nations (like Britain represented by small boats) because they may accomplish feats that big nations (represented by the destroyers) may not be able to achieve. There is also another moment where the soldiers ask the civilians of the Moonstone saying ""we let you down, didn't we?"" reiterating the fact that how the military may have let the country down but the country did not let its soldiers down. We also see the spirit of the people when we see Dawson and his son heading fearlessly towards Dunkirk to rescue the stranded soldiers but the Shivering soldier, Fortis leader, is afraid to go back and many times tries to force them to change course. However, they hold steady, determined to complete the mission. We also see that civilians trust themselves to be more quick and effective than the military and all the bureaucratic red tape when Dawson doesn't wait for the navy but sets off on his own to do the exact same thing he was requisitioned for. 
 *And this is the part of the movie where I would like to mention how it relates to India. The fact that the strength of the military isn't everything in the war, the spirit of the nation matters more is why India should never cower before China. They may have better machines, we have better people.*

Next, there are elements of poetic justice in the movie. We see that Tommy, who stands up for ""Gibson"" in the Dutch boat is saved by the Moonstone but the Highlander who wants to sacrifice ""Gibson"" because of him being French and then Tommy who is not a member of the Highland regiment is forced to come up for air and is burnt alive - or poetically speaking burns in hell. Then again, Alex, who is pragmatic vs Tommy who is more moralistic in comparison face resolution of guilt at different times. While Tommy, who is more considerate and observant (remember he is the one who talks about the ""grouping"" of bullet holes), notices that the man handing out blankets on the train station is blind. When the old guy says, well done, he asks him ""But all I did was survive"", the old guy says "" That's enough"". His guilt and burden is resolved and he can peacefully sleep on the train. Alex, on the other hand, because of his superficial nature, burning guilt and less regard for others, thinks that the guy is so ashamed of them that he can't even look them in the eyes. He faces this guilt all night, even reads hatred from the people in the headlines of the newspaper and cannot look at the people until he sees that they are applauding them not spitting in their faces. This reflects on how we see in the world a lot of what we are and what we feel inside. It also touches upon the fact that ultimately, the soldiers' guilt and burden can only be lessened by the country and they feel as successful as the nation makes them feel. Their victory is not at the fronts but in the eyes of the nation and they always want validation from it. We also see this when Peter tells the Fortis leader that George will be okay even though he is dead. It suggests that it is a sort of duty of the civilians to grant clemency to the soldiers to relieve them of their burden.

Also, the movie seems to sort of touch on the fact that how one ""good soul"" is worth more than many average souls. It seems like good people keep taking the place of many average people in the movie. eg, ""Gibson"" saves Tommy, Alex, and others from drowning but ends up drowning himself. ""Farrier"" saves the 300,000 British soldiers on the beach from the dive bombers and the army that has broken through the perimeter but ends up being taken hostage by the Germans himself. It always seems like they take the place of many good people and God/ Heaven/Universe is content to exchange their one soul for the souls of many. Also, this shows how miracles don't just happen. Every miracle has a cost, the life of someone else, someone else's sacrifice for someone else's gain.

Then there is a glorification of war and our duty towards glorifying it. How young men are encouraged to die in futility many times in the name of war. We see this aboard the Moonstone as Dawson, Peter, and George set sail to rescue the stranded men. While Dawson and Peter save many men and fulfill an important mission, George only joins them because he wants to be a hero in the war zone and wants his photograph in the paper. He is just observing and trying to make himself useful but ends up dying before he could actually do something substantial. Again, the futile deaths and suffering in the war is highlighted when the man trying to escape to the destroyer gets caught between the ferry and the destroyer and ends up with crushed legs. Also, there is a difference in how Dawson and Peter look at the Shivering Soldier, the leader of Fortis air trio. While Dawson tries to understand his pain and looks at him as a human, Peter looks at him as a coward for not wanting to die in the war. In the end, however, we see how the experience changes Peter, who gives clemency to Fortis Leader by lying to him by saying that George will be fine. We see how Dawson approves of this. Again, a reflection on how war changes people and a reflection on our duty towards the soldiers and not just their duty towards the nation. We also see the irony of Dawson sympathizing with the plight of the Shivering soldier who is afraid to go into war, kills George and is trying to prevent Dawson from rescuing soldiers when Dawson's own son died in the war. We can see the effects of war on people again when the camera shows Peter and Tommy, two people of almost the same age but one weighed down by the horrors of war and the other a lad just coming to terms with the disillusionment of what war is.      
We also see that it is the civilians who make the heroes what they are. Heroes are formed when the nation accepts them to be so. We see that when Peter and Dawson get George's picture printed in the newspaper and only then Peter gains satisfaction. This reflects on that every life lost in the battle is treated with respect irrespective of circumstances for the satisfaction of the loved ones that their children/siblings/spouse did not make the ultimate sacrifice in vain, even when so many wars are futile.

Then there is the contrast in the thinking of people in accordance with their ranks and situations. The soldiers are fighting on the Dutch boat and want to sacrifice the French and then the non-Highlanders to survive. On the other hand, the French ""Gibson"" saves Tommy and Alex not once but twice, once by opening the door and the second time by slipping the rope from the boat. We also see this discord when the French soldier asks Tommy to move along from the French line at the beach in the beginning of the movie. The admiral, on the other hand, wants to stay back to help the Fench at the end of the movie. We have seen earlier in the movie admiral saying ""we should get our army back for the next battle which will happen in Britain"" but he seems dejected when Britain seems dejected when Britain seems to hold off on destroyers saving them for the next battle. Again we see how the military can let its own people down and the civilians never do. Another example is when the Highlanders on the boat refuse to let Tommy and Alex on but ""Gibson"" slips them a rope. We also see this spirit again when the civilians hail the arrival of the soldiers after all they have done is survived.On the other hand, ranks may not really mean much as we see that Farrier ends up saving the day while the Fortis Leader is a trembling mess and ends up killing a civilian. In all of this, the movie tries to highlight that soldiers, too, are just ordinary men doing their best to survive extraordinarily stressful events one minute and one event at a time.

It also focuses on how the efforts of so many remain unsung in the war. Like when soldiers accuse Collins of not being there for them aka airforce not doing enough for them at the station while Dawson reassures them they know you were there for them. Again, how the country never lets its soldiers down and how the nation's validation is important for the soldiers fighting for it.

Then there is the ending. The fact that Farrier keeps gliding even after the last drops of fuel have run out captures the spirit of the soldiers and the nation to fight until its last breath. The fact that even when dying it manages to save thousands of people by shooting down the last plane shows that even if a soldier or country is going down, it can save other people and countries and give them the miracle of living on. Of how Farrier, instead of just ejecting from the plane, lands it down and gives it a proper patriotic send-off by burning it. Which goes to show how the people of a country don't just jump off from it when it goes down, they respect it to the end even if it is burning due to war, internal struggles, whatever. It also reflects on the fact that though the main player may have gone down (Farrier) the many people who survived would, because of him, carry on the legacy which lines up with the ending of the movie which says that even if Britain went down, its colonies abroad would carry on their legacy. ( I have some words regarding that legacy of colonies but that is not the point of the movie). And lastly they show the Plane in flames but its structure still stands respectfully because of a good person like Farrier which showcases how the entire Europe burned in the World Wars (of their own making) but the spirit and the structure of Europe survived it due to the ""good men."" Again, a reflection on how the respect for a country is determined by the character of its people.

In the entire movie the themes that are common. Wars are not won by armies but by the spirit of the people. Armies may let countries down, but the country never lets it down. Poetic justice finds its way. How war changes people and the duty of the citizens to laud the soldiers who choose to fight regardless of everything.

I also appreciated small things that were incorporated. eg. at the beginning when the dive bombers bomb the beach when the explosions are far away, the sound is delayed from the visual of the explosion but when the explosions come near, the delay decreases. Something that is correct according to the laws of physics but I have never seen depicted in movies and have commented on in my head while watching the movies in the past. Then, how Tommy meets Gibson while attending nature's call. It's just wrenching that he just survived an attack on his life and then he just goes to attend his business. It is disturbing that attacks on the lives are just as routine to the soldiers as reading a newspaper is to us and the movie captures this well. Then when dive bombers throw bombs over a bridge, Tommy covers his ears. It's not the depiction of a war hero like in many other movies, its the true depiction of what soldiers are, just humans who chose to go to war and have to face horrible situations. It is also depicted with Farrier when he shows perplexion and uncertainty many times. I really liked that there was a Dutch merchant sailor, out of nowhere, he just came to help these guys. The fact that none of the army men knew anything about the tides anywhere. The fact that presence of mind helps these people more than any crazy stunts or machine guns or brawn - like when Tommy decides to take the stretcher to get aboard the ship, when Farrier keeps track of fuel by asking Collins. The incident when the Dutch doesn't understand ""ballast"" and has to be told ""weight"". Just little things that were quite meticulous.

That's all that I can put together right now. I shall add more when I think of something else I forgot to jot down or someone brings up a good point. Let me know what you gleaned from it.",concernadian," TL;DR version de kake!  [removed] Well it's detailed all right.

HRD Ministry seeks your views/suggestions/comments for creating 20 World class institutions by 28 Oct. Lets's do our part r/india.,134,56kz6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/56kz6z/hrd_ministry_seeks_your_viewssuggestionscomments/,52,"http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Public%20Consultation%20Document.pdf

Since most people are not reading the draft policy and trying to turn this post into how the GoI controls premier education and how bad the condition is. Look it's not that we aren't aware of it, we all know the reality but I hoped that this post will be about solutions, not cribbing about problems. Anyway here is the gist of drafted policy:

**Objective:**

To provide an **enabling regulatory architecture** to **ten public and ten private** Higher Educational Institutions to emerge as world-class Teaching and Research Institutions. (Right now we have way too many policy restriction on universities, they need approval for almost everything from UGC).

**What the hell do they mean by enabling regulatory architecture :**

These draft Guidelines & Regulations contain eligibility criteria, selection procedure, other Regulatory aspects, monitoring & evaluation, etc for World Class Institutions. These have been drafted considering the characteristics of a institutions which are world class which includes exceptionally high quality teaching and research standards preferably in multi-disciplinary areas; a significant proportion of international and meritorious students; a reasonably good proportion of qualified faculty from high-ranked universities worldwide, transparent and need-blind system to ensure intake of meritorious students; adequate financial assistance to students; a healthy faculty student ratio; well-equipped facilities for teaching, research, administration and student-life; adequate infrastructure for operations and expansion; autonomous governance structures; financial soundness through either a large corpus fund or recourse to public funding, as the case may be and, teaching and research collaborations with reputed global universities. 

The draft Guidelines & Regulations also provides for admission procedure, fixing appropriate fee structures pursuant to internal policies, appointment of faculty, collaboration with foreign higher educational institutions, and design and offer courses in existing programmes and new areas. **Additionally, these institutions shall have complete financial autonomy to spend the resources raised and allocated.**

**Expectation from World class institution:**

1.	It should preferably be multi-disciplinary and have both teaching and research focus of an exceptionally high quality. Apart from the regular courses, it should also offer various inter-disciplinary courses, including in areas of emerging technology and interest as well as those of relevance to the development concerns of countries like India. 

2.	It should have a good proportion of foreign or foreign qualified faculty. There should be a reasonably good mix of domestic and foreign students. There should be a transparent merit based selection in admissions, so that the focus remains on getting meritorious students.                          


3.	There should be laboratory facilities that do cutting-edge scientific research for those Institutions engaged in scientific research. In case of humanities and social science and other interdisciplinary areas, the faculty should be engaged in research and field work in frontier areas using the latest methodologies. 

4.	It should have student amenities comparable with that of globally reputed institutions. It should have a student enrolment of at least twenty thousand students in a period of fifteen years. The faculty student ratio should not be less than 1:10 after three years of declaration as a World Class Institution. 

5.	It should come in top five hundred of any of the world renowned ranking frameworks (such as the Times Higher Education World University Rankings or QS or Shanghai’s Jiao Tong University) in the first ten years of setting up or being declared as World Class Institution. 

**Financial assistance to WCI:**

The assistance would be up to an amount of Rupees five hundred Crore to each Institution in a span of five years from 2016-17 to 2020-21. The annual release would be dependent on the institution achieving the financial and physical outcomes laid down in its implementation plan. However, if any Institution shows capacity to absorb the funds earlier and is able to give the expected outcomes, an accelerated pace of funding would also be allowed. The funding under these guidelines would be in addition to the existing funding to which they are entitled to.

Rest pages talks about guidelines for institutions and their eligibility criteria.",bakchodibaba," You can't appoint political stooges to head institutions and then expect them to be world class or ask them to waste funds on a unnecessary flags.

Stop interfering with Universities make them autonomous, have real academicians head them and you will have World Class institutes. All the best universities we have are because they have been autonomous. A world class institution isn't it buildings, syllabuses, structure, facilities, courses, brand or history. A world class institution is its faculty.

Start small with a few courses. 20 institutions, 20 teachers each. Make a list of the 400 best Indian teachers in the world. Do whatever you can to get them to commit 4 years to teaching them in India. And give them full autonomy over everything - courses, syllabus, staff, what facilities they spend money on, mess food vendor, everything. 

Having committees, criterias, monitoring and all other bureaucratic nonsense will just lead to average institutions by virtue of the law of averages. Please have coed hostels to maximise opposite gender interaction I don't know  what constitutes as 'world class' but if it means being listed as Top 100 universities  by QS or THE, it's actually   implementable. These rankings give great amount of  weightage to peer reviews by fellow faculties and with poor researchers that we have , it is becoming hard to get a good ratings nowadays. 

Typically, only IITs look for people with international doctoral degrees  and that too includes fresh graduates from tier 3 US universities with less than stellar Publication record. Great researchers often  don't want to work in India,unless they are compelled to return due to familial reasons,  because of    low salary (IIRC it was around 90,000 rs pm ). 

 Some of my suggestion would include, 



Get rid of quota and nationality requirements for   assistant professor job postings. In fact make an actual effort to hire foreign faculty with good SCI publications as  these rankings give good weightage for the diversity and reputation of faculty .

Make  international PhD and postdoc as mandatory requirement. I hate to say this but many Indian PhD programs are joke really. I have seen people graduating  by publishing only in predatory  paid journals.  And as a result, they are literally unknown in their fields diminishing our rankings.

Increase the salary of the faculties to be in line with international standards. How else can we have world class researchers without paying them what they are worth?

Stop subsidising the  NIT and IIT courses. Inaddition to the subsidy, I was even paid stipend of 8000rs per month for pursuing masters but that was a daft way to waste the taxpayers money.  Instead government should increase the fee as dictated by market  and arrange for easy loans with few collaterals.

Priority should be given to carry out publishable short term research instead of long term  research projects with huge uncertainty. IMO this is the huge factor for American universities to fall behind universities like singua, NUS, and NTU in these world rankings .
These Asian universities basically game these rankings without actually being better in research  than their American counterparts.

The above changes may increase our rankings and make us look good at least on paper. But if you want to have the universities that actually help the society like US, it has to be done by creating   specialists research group for each field. 

 Unique Research groups are more hard to create and their impacts are mightily downplayed in the rankings. Take for example , Harvard.  It is not really renowned for its engineering programs but in my area of research bio inspired robotics, it has much more bigger impact than MIT , Caltech  , or CMU. If you look at any major developments in this area, it is basically through a Harvard alumni.  This sort of impact is painstakingly hard to create and measure. [removed] Appoint RSS guys to head these institutions like they did in IIT-BHU, ICHR, VNIT etc.   
 More interaction between institutions and society.  There must be a mandatory three year bond for these people to serve in rural area. Also they should not be allowed to leave country for any sort of job. No NORI should be given to them unless they pay 5 lakh rupees. [deleted] The best way to make good institutions is to ditch the 'University' model for all the institutions and focus on making a good single field colleges. In the old days we used to have Universities because the knowledge, books, teachers etc. were all scarce commodities so they were all aggregated in one place which was a metropolitan city. I don't know why that needs to be right now. 

For eg: If you have 5 institutions each with only one branch then it'll increase quality more than having one university with 5 branches. It makes sense economically as well, for eg: you have one university with 5 branches with 60 students each, then one subject professor and equipments are shared by only 60 students. You rather make a single institution all of which is devoted to, like mechanical engineering and it can have a batch of 120 students then all that resource can be shared by 120 students, and then institution won't have to divide money and students in 5 parts but all of the focus can be on single aspect. 

If you had the option to study computer science in ABC university which teaches everything OR ABC institute of computer science then of course you'll think that the latter will have higher quality education as all of it is about CS only.

The big universities are already LIKE THAT only, they have whole different buildings for each department which are independent, but there is no need for small private colleges to work like universities. They should rather remodel themselves to be really good at teaching one thing rather than teaching sub-standard 8 branches of engineering. I am big fan of institues like IIIT, which just computer-science and IT and ICT-institute of chemical technology which creates much better chemical engineers, let's say as compare to NITs who just get jobs in CS/IT anyways. Save money: Immediately stop all project grants, scrape all research fellowships; what do those idiots do anyways.

Use money: Set a cow university and a cow research institute. At least then we will have truely world-class cow scientists developing next-generation environment-friendly  gomutro based super-medicines and cow dung based fuel cells right in India. 

Profit.

/s I don't know man, creating 20 world class institutions by Oct. 28 seems almost impossible.

EDIT: TIL, no bakchodi allowed on /u/bakchodibaba's thread There is a huge set of sufficient conditions to create world class Universities in India, but only one necessary condition: freedom from UGC. This perverse Soviet body has no analog in country with a successful University ecosystem. 

It is not a coincidence that the best universities in India are not governed by UGC. Just as it is not a coincidence that BCCI, the most successful sport body in India is not registered.   A legit entrance examination. I was so interested in CSE since my school days. Why is my level of chemistry and physics tested? Why isn't my interest in CS gauged at all while choosing my undergraduate program? 

There are a lot of good students stuck in wrong streams.  It is very difficult to create world-class educational institutions in a vacuum. The political and industrial climate, living conditions, autonomy of the institution all play a major role.  Why would a person who could go to some other world-class institution in a better country choose to come here ?

Can I get some career advice?,10,78mw0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/78mw0r/can_i_get_some_career_advice/,9,"I'm doing B.Tech in CS from a tier-3 college. Recently, companies have started coming in our colleges for campus recruitment and I have managed to secure a job in a mid-sized company at 4LPA(3.5 in-hand) but the problem is that the company is asking for a 3 years of bond agreement. Also, I got in touch with the employees and they told me that promotion is near impossible. That is the reason why I'm posting this here.

Now, although more companies paying higher salaries or offering better jobs will come to our campus, are there any other ways from which I can get a job? Hackerearth (suggested by someone) is a good place but all the hiring challenges require some industry experience. I've been told by my seniors to start using Linked-in and Angel to network and find jobs. I'm confused now about what should I be doing? Should I focus on competitive programming and problem solving skills, should I learn new technologies which I can show on my resume and/or build new projects.

I still have a semester left and I want to get as high-paying job as I can get to get to the 1.6LPM crowd. Also, I'm not in just for the money, I have interest in general computer science and I know programming, data-structures, algorithms, and my knowledge of hardware-software is, I believe, very good. However, my technology stack isn't good as the other guys in my college.",hashedout," Is the company located in Bangalore? Does the name start with m and end with usigma? Please no matter what don't get into a bond situation. I can understand that you might want a better job, etc. but bonds are like slave labor. You are currently in the top tier of people who even qualify for a decent job. Keep looking and I am sure you will find something better. Please don't get into a bond. 

I have been working in the IT industry for the past 12 years. The job scene is still decent due to the start-up scene. AngelList for the win. All my close friends have managed to get jobs from AngelList straight out of college. The good thing about these jobs is since they are not campus placements, almost none of them have bonds. First, ask how much do you have to pay in order to break the bond. If it is below 70k, then it is alright. Also, ask your seniors which technologies do the company work in. If it is comparatively new technology, then you can work there for like a year.

You will learn more while working in a company, getting into some decent projects, provided you are working on good technologies, not mainframe or excel or such.

I would say, take up the offer. Apply for better companies when they come. If you get selected in a better one, well and good. If not, you will still have the offer in hand. You will probably have a couple of months' period after you graduate and you actually start your work. You can learn things during that time. Then you can start your work, work hard, learn things on the way, then jump companies when you think you are ready. By that time, at least you will have some good projects and work experience to put up on your resume too.

Believe me, the off-campus scene is very very competitive once you graduate. You will find people who have interned in big companies all around. 

Work hard, try to get into good projects in the company. If you know any friends who work in big companies, you can always request them to refer you later on once you feel you are ready.",Science/Technology,2017-10-25 18:50:23

Anti-intellectualism in India,16,711g4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/711g4o/antiintellectualism_in_india/,8,"Welcome the country where 'hard work is greater than Harvard'. (Oh! The Irony.) In a country where the top man expresses such a ridiculous sentiment, no wonder we see WhatsApp messages becoming policy (demonetisation) and ridiculous blog posts becoming sufficient to call into question decades of dedication (the defamation of JL Nehru). 

What I fail to understand is the reason behind rising anti-intellectualism in this country. 

Take history, for example. Historians like Romila Thapar reach their conclusions after years of research, have them validated through peer review, and they are held in high esteem across the world. But in our country, random Quora posts are enough to call their work into question. 

Now, education does not make you more intelligent than others. But it definitely gives you expertise, because of the time and 'hard work' you put into a learning about a subject. 

What is education worth if we don't recognise this? Why spend years and years doing 'hard work' if at the end of the day people are going to give more value to some hairy baba spouting ridiculous crap. 

We talk about our great contribution to science and technology, to philosophy and mathematics, but I fail to see any similarities between the great ones of the past and the petty folk of today. 

Everything is really sad and disheartening.

Let's discuss the state of Indian intelligence agencies in terms of cyber power.,48,5kssg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5kssg6/lets_discuss_the_state_of_indian_intelligence/,30,"While almost every week there is a story or another about the NSA, CIA, GHCQ invading the privacy of the citizens, launching attacks against cyber criminals, putting people on certain _lists_ for using Tor etc.,  Indian intelligence agencies have been off the radar. I have a strong feeling that it's not because they choose to, but because they lack the skills.

Why do you think that is?  The NSA, SIS, GHCQ, FBI etc. make it a point to hire top security professionals and even hire interns directly from universities. The candidates selected consider it as a good career path, both in terms of serving the nation and in terms of intellectual satisfaction. Compare it with the state in India, where RAW and IB don't even have a dedicated website. I understand the need for secrecy, but at least have a fucking portfolio! One cannot even directly apply to RAW. One needs to join some other government department and then one gets transferred. (like seriously?). Just have a look at [NSA](https://www.intelligencecareers.gov/nsa/), [GHCQ](https://www.gchq-careers.co.uk/recruitment-process.html), [FBI] (http://www.fbiagentedu.org/careers/cyber-crimes/), [SIS](https://www.sis.gov.uk/science-and-technology.html) career websites and then look at Indian [IB's](http://mha.nic.in/vacancies) (No, there isn't even a webpage specific to IB and like I said, one cannot directly get into RAW). Would a person who is **actually** skilled even want to apply or work here? I don't think so.

I believe that India has not paid enough attention to strengthening its cyber power. I believe that we need to have some _Kevin Mitnick_ sort of personalities to wreak havoc on the cyber security front by unlawful activities. (Instead of fakers like Ankit Fadia). Why?

* There's huge money to be made in it.
* The Indian intelligence agencies won't be able to catch you (unskilled that I think they are).
* Even if they figure out you were behind it, you could easily hide in the 1.252 billion population that India has. 
* The infrastructure to attack is highly outdated and vulnerable (For instance [this](https://www.troyhunt.com/43-203-indian-patient-pathology-reports-were-left-publicly-exposed-by-health-solutions/).).

My worst fear is that if there is a war in the future, it will be a cyber war, and India will be left devastated. It's not that we don't have the skills, it's just that the government needs a slap on its face. Like seriously, our government needs to change. How can a few babulog sitting behind desks who have no clue about technology properly shape the laws concerning cyber security and privacy? Why can't our leaders debate about such technical issues during election campaigns (like Hillary and Trump did) ? They don't because they don't feel such issues are important enough. Like I said before, we need some big hacks to happen in order to stir things up.",PM_ME_YOUR_PU55Y_," >One cannot even directly apply to RAW.  

That's because you're not observant enough.  ""Cabinet Secretariat"" regularly gives ads for research and field officer positions in newspapers. Application is through GATE. Ever Heard of NTRO - National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) , that is the Cyber Espionage and Cyber Counter offensive wing of Indian Intelligence. Also India's Radio Research Center, is one such agency that has significant budget and surveillance capabilities. 

Both combined together have significant capabilities when it comes to Cyber Surveillance & continuous monitoring of web and mobile chatter,  almost all major Indian cities have significant land parcels hosting,  NTRO & RRO antennas, this is the Indian department that is always listening and analyzing data from all major telcos and ISPs.


Indian intelligence works more traditionally. where the focus is on under-advertising your capabilities and also major capabilities are spend in scoping out the opposition parties.

If you know where to look on Google Maps, you would be able to find major tracts of Lands dedicated to NTRO & RRO in New Delhi.  if you know where to read & look online,  you should be able to spot Indian state sponsored active botnets and presence. 

Though it may be less capable and intrusive as NSA, but India has its asses covered from the fear mongering that you just did, I believe, you can rest easy. abe kamse kam google kar liya kar. there is a good amount of information about mass surveillance in India.

Infact the telegraph act states that a telecom license can not be granted without having a backdoor access for the government.

remember the blackerry fiasco?
remember the satellite phone ban? and how only iridium devices on Tata networks are allowed in India? they have a listening post in Pune at the gateway.

don't use facebook if you really care about your privacy.
 This what they *want* you to think. India has a long history of playing the underdog. RAW for instance operated for years without the government even acknowledging its existence.

Even some light Googling will tell you about whispers of India's mass surveillance projects and how much tabs are being kept on communications. i mean the DRDO directly recruited from a friend's college (PES college in bangalore)- they judged via an internship. it was only open to top 3 people in the batch via grades (and recommended by the head)so they are hiring only the best I agree with everything you said, but first and foremost all of them needs to be put under the direct control of the Parliament. Intelligence agencies need to answer to the Republic (Parliament) rather than the PM/Ruling Party/Executive branch. I did always wonder why we don't have televised debates between candidates running for power. It's a very interesting way to check whether the candidate you're supporting or wish to support does align with your ideology. >I believe that India has not paid enough attention to strengthening its cyber power. I believe that we need to have some Kevin Mitnick sort of personalities to wreak havoc on the cyber security front by unlawful activities. (Instead of fakers like Ankit Fadia). Why?

It seems impossible to me that India can have personalities like Kevin Mitnick. The education system is largely to be blamed. Herds of people join B.Tech Engineering, learning all kinds of shit and end up in some company like TCS handling customers at Quantas or something like that. Even from childhood, children are not encouraged to explore anything. Just sit in a coaching center and chant ""FIITJEEans today, IITians tomorrow"". I wish people looked at [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz). He was given a computer when he was 3 years old, and he ran with it.

Then there is our media houses. They fucking churn out crappy movies like Ra.one and Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and people run in hoards to....fuck it. Then there is Kapil Sharma's Show and Bigg Boss and endless saas-bahu serials. Indian TV is so frustrating to watch, one has to find solace in western shows. One good thing and that even banned (Torrenting). I have never seen a quality documentary produced in India. What would it take to start shows like '[Last Week Tonight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3530232)' or '[Vice](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2782710/)' in India? I know jack shit about my own country. I know nothing about its past or where we are heading. I came to know about Ramanujan's story from the movie, The Man Who Knew Infinity.  

Then there is the archaic institution of marriage. Fuck it.

>One cannot even directly apply to RAW.

My maternal uncle is in the army. Recently, I asked him, how can one get into intelligence agencies in India. His reply - ""RAW is an intelligence agency"". What in the bloody fuck am I supposed to do with that. Either he doesn't know it (which is pathetic) or its ""classified"". Conclusion - I don't know. I don't have the answers. I wonder who does.

This is the Story of my relationship with religion - A Long Read!,20,6nu3gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6nu3gu/this_is_the_story_of_my_relationship_with/,12,"This is the Story of my relationship with religion:

I was in my 2nd Standard at an excellent Jesuit school in Ahmedabad when my class teacher Mrs Sinha asked “How many Hindus in this Class?”. It was for some Government count as far as I can remember. A majority of my classmates raised their hands. Then she asked “How many Muslims in this class?”, a few raised their hands. She proceeded to ask 1 or 2 more questions. I didn’t raise my hand at all. I didn’t know what those words meant, I didn’t know ‘what I was’. My bench partner on the day noticed this and complained at the end: “Ma’am, he didn’t raise his hand”. “What are you?”, Mrs. Sinha barked at me. “I don’t know”, I replied. She looked into my admission documents as I’d just joined that School and got back “You’re Muslim!”. That day I returned home and told my mother what happened. I asked her: “Mumma, what is Muslim?”, “It’s a name beta, we are Muslim”, she replied. That was how I discovered religion.


I was born & raised in an elite locality of Ahmedabad, which was predominantly Hindu but had a mix of a few others at the time. My first few years were spent in ‘Shri Krishna Apartments’ where out of 300-odd Apartments, we were the only Muslim family and this never became a problem with any neighbour ever. Our neighbours loved us and we loved them. Then in 1992, my grandparents’ home got burnt down in another mixed locality in Ahmedabad, right behind the famed IIM Ahmedabad. Some neighbours too came and joined in the loot, they were told. By this time, I had also learnt that my great-grandparents' home in the old city of Ahmedabad had been burnt a good 5-6 times over the years. Coming back to my immediate family, in 1992 our neighbours still stood by us but some people in the adjoining neighbourhood had noticed that we were Muslim and began threatening my parents to leave the place. They would wait outside our gate to threaten us when we passed. The builder of our Apartment - Kiran bhai stood by us and told us “Don’t you worry, I will deal with them”. But things kept building up. A few days later, when my father was driving his car, he was brought to a standstill thanks to a huge jam. It turned out that some BJP/VHP workers had stopped all cars and were climbing on the windshield of each to paint a Swastik. He was obviously shit scared but he stayed calm, waited for his turn to arrive, quietly got the swastik painted on his car too and then sped away like a madman.

On another scary night when rumours were growing of more riots brewing across Ahmedabad, we ran away to a family friend’s place. He taught at IIM Ahmedabad and my parents must’ve thought his on-campus-home would be a good place to hide at. Somewhere in the midst of our conversation with our hosts, loud noises from what seemed like a large group of people started coming from a distance. My parents were certain that a mob had entered IIM-A, maybe they’d heard about us hiding there. Our hosts too were obviously scared and the predicament we had put them in further troubled my parents. Then our host got an idea and said “Let me dial the watchman at the gate and ask where the mob has reached”. When he called, the watchman told him that the noise was from a Basketball match that was going on in the IIMA Campus.

Eventually things took a decisive turn. When we returned home one night, there was a paper stuck on our door, which said something on the lines of: “Last warning! Leave or else!”. That this had reached our doorstep was the last straw and my parents relented. Still, my mother was adamant that she does not want me to grow up in a ghetto and hence we moved to another mainstream locality, near the famed NID this time. Our lane was a mix of Hindus and Muslims at the time. One of the first neighbours we befriended was a lovely inter-religious couple - Indian Architects who studied in Paris. Their home in a similar Hindu-majority locality had just been attacked and they too had fled and come to this new place.

Although I was just four at the time, all these things made me further aware of Religion as a concept. As I grew up, often I was asked after a first introduction: Arastu??? Are you Parsi? First, I used to say “No, I’m Muslim”. As I grew up further, I would often lie: “Yes, I’m Parsi”. Sometimes I would say: “No no no no, I am Hindu!”. A few times when I dared to let it out: “No, I am Muslim”, I’d generally get a second response: “Oh! You don’t look Muslim”. Sometimes there would be no response but just a weird look on their face.

But regardless of whatever I said, I never felt as if I belonged to any religion. My family didn’t pray, we didn’t fast. The only time I would go to a mosque would be when my father used to take me on Eid mornings and I’d look around and rise, kneel and appear to murmur copying whatever others around me did. Post 1992, in the new Society we had moved to, gradually all Hindus moved out and it became a Muslim-only lane. So all of the boys used to gather, pray, fast and stand outside the mosque. But never me. They’d bully me from time to time, although my father’s hostility to everyone also contributed to that. I remember being bullied even for things such as wearing shorts! “Maulana says we shouldn’t wear shorts”, they’d say. “Maulana says we shouldn’t watch TV”. Sometimes when the Maulana from the nearby Madrasa used to drive by on his bicycle, they’d abandon the cricket match we were playing and hide inside the car parking waiting for the Maulana to pass. I’d be the only one still standing there wondering what just happened! We had two lovely dogs for a while and multiple complaints were made since dogs and their drool are considered unholy in Islam. I remember being called a ‘Kaafir’ and much more multiple times while growing up. My relationship with religion then could best be described as ‘indifferent’.

I remember two more instances during that period. One was when we had made a rare visit to one of our Muslim neighbour’s home and their daughter asked me to confirm the rumours she’d heard: “Tum namaz nahi padte?”, I said “Nahi”, she went on “Tumhe pata hai na ke 2 Jumme (Friday) tak namaz na pade toh Musalman nahi rehte”. My usually ultra-aggressive father too stunningly remained shut and just made an awkward face. 'Namaz nahi padhoge toh yeh hoga, aisi saza milegi, waisa gunaah chadega' - Have heard this umpteen times, yearned for someone to tell me what good it will do or at least expected them to tell me to pray out of gratitude and not fear but no one ever did, not one time. The second instance was when I got into a fight with a classmate from School over something on our Football ground. He came, pushed me to the ground and yelled: “Saale miye, ghar jala dunga tera”. I remember my first reaction to that being: ‘Shit, now the others too know I’m Muslim’. That fact had been considerably concealed otherwise because my name seemed secular (deliberately so, my mum had insisted I have that kind of a name) and my appearance or accent didn’t betray signs matching any stereotype people had in their heads either.

I don't remember seeing a Muslim girl in my lane after the age of around 10-12. They were either in burkhas or just indoors. I saw some of them the only time in their own weddings but there too, almost always, their faces and heads would be hidden. I remember another instance from this time. I have addressed my mother as ""Mumma"" my entire life, at times that ""Mumma"" would get abbreviated to ""Mu"" pronounced as ""Mo"" of ""Mother"". My school auto had come to pick me and as I came out, my mom waved goodbye and I said ""Bye mu"". A Muslim auto-mate laughed: ""Yeh toh Hinduyo ki tarah mummy ko 'Maa' bolta hai!"".

Then around 1998, I remember that one day when I heard that my best friend’s parents’ general store had been burnt down. There was no riot in the city, just a minor communal rumour somewhere and just that one shop had been burnt. I remember going to their rival’s store next door to buy something the next day. As I stood there, that shop-owner was speaking to another man and their conversation went on the lines of “You saw what I did!”, “Ya but I gave the Kerosene” came the reply.

Sometime around this, I discovered one day that my father, who had a habit of making powerful acquaintances had been communicating on inland letters with the then RSS chief K. S. Sudarshan. He used to keep some of those letters with him whenever a communal rumour flew around. Those letters would help him escape a potential mob he thought! Sudarshan called us one night for dinner to an RSS headquarter somewhere near Ahmedabad. We were escorted by a car, the time was around 8.30 PM when we reached. I remember walking past a group of about 20-30 stick-wielding men in Khaki chaddis practicing their drills, it was really scary for a child. As we walked in, Sudarshan was seated on a sofa in a reasonably austere room. 3-4 people sat around him. The first question we were asked was: “Aap ka ghar aur office kaha hai?”, my dad replied and two men got up and went to the other room, returning after a while. Till this day, it is my suspicion that none of our properties were ever targetted because of something those men noted down that night.

This became something that possibly helped us just a few years later. It was around 4.30 PM on the 27th of February 2002. I was about to leave for my tuition class when my mother called me from office. “Beta, don’t go, there’s some news of a riot, we too are returning home”. By then, I knew the drill, I cancelled all my plans and just stayed indoors. I remember my parents coming home soon after and us having a very interrupted half-sleep that night. When we woke up the next morning and stepped outside our ground-floor home, I could see thick, black smoke on 2-3 sides. One of those seemed to be from quite close by, could it be my father’s office building we suspected, as that was just at the next crossroads. Soon we heard from neighbours that every single Muslim establishment in that building had been burnt down except my father’s office. Maybe it was the note those two men made that night that helped, maybe it wasn’t.

The local TV Cable channels were playing ‘Gadar’ that day. Soon after, neighbours began gathering in the entire lane. Despite being raised by an abusive father, the tension I felt at that moment as a fourteen year old was new to me. I was scared for my life and that was because some people suddenly wanted to kill everyone who had the name I was born with! People around me were talking in a language I didn’t understand. There were talks about where we could run, who lived in what direction, people from what religion stayed in which neighbouring lanes. I had never felt more aware of my surroundings! Women and children were asked to go to the terraces to prepare kerosene bottles and throw them in case a mob attacked. Some of the more enterprising men said they will stand guard on both sides of our lane. ""Mob aa bhi gaya toh yeh aadmi kya kar lene waala hai!"" was the hushed response to that offer!

I remember my father trying to be brave and walking to one end of the lane that evening. He returned soon after and said he saw the now slain BJP Leader Haren Pandya leading a mob that was gathering at the crossroads just outside. It was many years later when my father happened to meet Mr Pandya when he told him: “Had I not been there that evening, your lane would have been burnt, I was trying to pacify the mob and steer them away”. But seeing that mob then obviously scared my father. In the meantime, my mother tried calling one family friend - A senior policeman. Always in the past, when we had called him in similar situations, he had immediately gotten a police point set up just outside. This time, to my mother’s astonishment, he replied: “Sorry, this time there’s nothing I can do”. My mother knew right then, this was different! After 10 years, it was now time for us to run again. 

That same inter-religious couple who were our first friends in the whole lane approached us saying that one of their friends leads the Police Academy, lives in the Muslim ghetto of Juhapura in Ahmedabad and has offered to host us in his farmhouse. Then we tried asking some families in our lane if they wanted to join because some space could have been arranged for them too. All of them said ‘No’. Some said they were worried about the black money, jewellery etc in their homes, some said they didn't want to run, some just didn't like my father. The police academy chief was smart, he made the watchmen outside his home wear police clothes and drive down to our home in his police car. We then rode in our car escorted by them and left our home yet again. I remember seeing this burning flame in a provision store owned by a Muslim uncle right outside our lane. I also remember seeing 2-3 mobs of 4-5 men on our way, all had trishuls in their hands, all wore saffron headbands. Suddenly this mystical area of ‘Juhapura’ seemed to be a saviour. 

I had never visited this area ever before. As we entered Juhapura, I remember someone in the car saying “Yeh border hai, hum aa gaye Juhapura”. The relief I felt entering a place I’d never been to still remains fresh in my mind.

I remember the next few nights. We stayed awake late into the night sitting on our host’s porch. We could see burning yellow lights (maybe flames) and hear loud noises and chants of mobs from 2-3 kms away, I discovered new practical laws of Science. The days would be no different. Every now and then black clouds of smoke could be seen in the distance and then it’d be a guessing game: “Woh Cargo Motors jala hoga”, “Woh so-and-so dukaan gayi hogi” and of course the phone too kept ringing. Gujarati newspapers too did their thing. I remember one popular Gujarati daily having a photo of a terrace taken from many terraces away with what seemed to be the vague figure of a man wearing something white having something in his hand and the following (translated) headline on their front page: “Who is this gun wielding Muslim?”. We returned to our home after a week or so, I was about to enter our door when one of our next-door neighbours saw us and screamed aloud: “Lo bhagode aa gaye vapas” (‘See, those who ran have returned’).

There had been no damage done to our lane but a few homes had been vandalized in the vicinity. One of them belonged to a school friend and classmate of mine, “One of the neighbours took our TV”, he told me much later. A few days after returning, I remember my mother speaking to a family-friend from our previous home - the one we had fled in 1992. She said they were so scared for their lives and even stopped going for their morning walks because they heard strong rumours of trucks full of Muslims coming to burn them from Juhapura. I think I almost laughed. I also remember how one night, many months later, when my father and I opened the door to the room where my mother was sleeping, she woke up startled, stood up and started howling at the top of her voice. She thought we were rioters who came to kill her. After pacifying her then, we eventually laughed it off over the years.

Two memories stand out additionally from this time. It was somewhere in March 2002 I think. We barely left home and everything seemed gloomy all the time. I got a call from a school classmate of mine inviting me to his birthday party. I couldn't understand his frame of mind and I think he couldn't understand mine. The second memory relates to yet another major change that happened in my life. My parents didn't feel comfortable sending me to my beloved School anymore as it was in a Hindu area. Remember this was March, final exam time was close and I was in my 9th grade. My father had a few calls with my school administration, they understood and gave me a promotion that year. For the next academic year, I was moved to another Jesuit school in the old city that had a healthy Muslim population. I have been asked several times why I made this strange move since the school I left was the one everyone wanted to go to, I have often cooked different stories up each time.

Soon after, my parents began working at riot relief camps. I remember my mother going to those camps quite often. I had been once, some NGO was getting kids there to draw. I remember this one girl having drawn a red haired monster. Soon my dad revived his old NGO and took it up full-time with my mother. I remember this one survey my father got conducted with some pedestrians around Ahmedabad. One of the questions was: “What do you think of Juhapura?"" (the same area we had escaped to). Some of the answers were: “It’s mini-Pakistan” to “There is a helipad there where helicopters from Pakistan bring missiles for war with India”. I also remember us stumbling upon these pamphlets from somewhere. They claimed to be published by the VHP/Bajrang Dal and their text in Gujarati read something on the lines of: ""These Muslim boys are very handsome and they fool and take away our Hindu girls later converting and marrying them. Let us open Gyms and beauty centers in Hindu areas too so that our boys too become handsome.""

Life moved on. Social activists began coming home, some film folk came too, there was lots of activity. An year later, mom and I finally left my father. Much later I discovered what had triggered that high a sense of empowerment and confidence within her after having been trodden upon for so long. She told me that in one of her visits to the relief camps, a woman came up to her and began howling: “Aap educated Muslim aurat hai, aap hamari haalat dekho, aap hamari madad nahi karenge toh kaun karega!”. 

That moment, she was liberated! The pain of 2002, the pain of that woman gave her a strange sense of empowerment. She realized that she did not need to bear anything, her pain wasn't the largest, she could be free, she could empower others too, she could still have a happy life!

Eventually she joined an iNGO and soon started the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (Some of you may know the name from the recent Haji Ali and Triple Talaq cases). I was fifteen when we left my father. Life became shockingly kind to me ever since I got out from those clutches. It was truly beautiful, I wasn’t good-for-nothing as I had been made to believe, I had skills too, I was liked too. After this ordeal, a lot of acquaintances too opened up to me on their respective domestic issues, I realized I wasn’t alone. After a period of selfish enjoyment to satiate my sense of being deprived, I became really passionate about empowering young people and started a non-profit. We worked for 6 years with about 6000 College youth educating them about issues such as Communalism, Gender, citizenship, even happiness.

I remember this one time when we took a group of Hindu youth from a mainstream College to Juhapura for an interaction with about 20 local girls from there. On the eve of our meeting, a lot of their parents warned them: “Are you sure you need to go?”, “Be careful, very bad people stay there” and so on. Most of them still came, we still went. That interaction was amongst the most beautiful moments I have ever experienced. These folks connected with those girls on so many levels. They were laughing, sharing anecdotes. Those girls said how they have never gone out of Juhapura, these youngsters shared how their problems seemed so much like their own. As we left, they hugged and invited each other to their respective social functions. The walls had been broken, at least for those 10-15 people we had taken that evening. I remember this other time when I took the same group to visit the worst-hit Naroda Patiya riot-victims. Every single victim, without exception, said: “Hindus aren’t the problem. There are good and bad people amongst both. This was the work of politics and politicians”.

On the opposite end, I remember this time when my grandfather came home one evening. Although he once prided himself on being irreligious, by this age he had a long beard and was always in a traditional white kurta-pyjama. He told my mother: “Beta yeh NGO ka kaam toh thik hai par Arastu ko bol thoda deen (religion) ka bhi kaam karey”. My mum replied: “Papa, aap ne jitna religion ka kaam apni zindagi mein kiya hai, us se zyada isne itni umar mein is NGO se kar liya hai”. I also remember how members of the Tablighi Jamaat would come to my home sometimes. Their job was to propagate Islam further and despite knowing I have never once prayed, fasted or gone to the neighbourhood mosque, they kept coming trying to patronize me into coming to the mosque. I remember one particular line said by an elite member of their group: “Aaj kal Musalman bachho ka dhyan bohot zyada Science aur Technology pe aa gaya hai. Woh sab toh theek hai par deen (religion) pe dhyan do pehle”.

As time passed, my mother finally met a kind, loving man and they got married. He happened to be a Brahmin Hindu. Interestingly, he devours Chicken and my mother loves Dosa. On my work front, things were moving at a decent pace. I was selected as Indian delegate to a Workshop in Bangkok, that was my first international trip. I remember this one time when I was walking through a flea-market and all of a sudden this cart full of hanging ducks and pigs came in front of me! I felt gross. That entire trip remained a struggle in terms of food. A fierce non-vegetarian back home, I struggled to find simple chicken to eat as there were all other kinds of animals there I found creepy. That moment, the whole Veg/non-veg debate back home, especially the religious flavour it is given in Gujarat, took a whole new turn in my head. It has nothing to do with religion or right or wrong I realized, it's just habit!

Soon after, the Public Affairs Unit of the American Embassy backed the NGO I was leading. Somewhere down the line they selected me for their International Visitor Leadership Program and sent me for a trip to the US. We were meeting with Senators and people from the UN and US Govt, we met iNGOs and more. Towards the end of the trip, I discovered that the introduction page that had been given to all the guests listed me as a “2002 riot survivor who was working with Muslim Youth on preventing them getting radicalized”. Everyone was nice to me, I was the star! It was ‘positive discrimination’. But that introduction couldn’t be further away from the truth, I was not a ‘riot survivor’, there were people who had lost people and property of their own, I hadn’t. And I wasn’t working with ‘Muslim Youth on preventing them getting radicalized’. I was in fact going to Colleges trying to educate Hindu Youth on communalism and more. I remember telling an American friend: “I don’t think I have been made to feel as Muslim in India as I have in America”. Towards the end of my trip, I remember calling my mother from America one night to tell her: “Mum I’m done, I’m leaving the non-profit world”, “Whatever you feel is best Beta!” she replied.

Moving on, I remember one thing an ex of mine used to tell me: “Tu Muslim nahi hai! Please! Maine keh diya bas!”. It made her more comfortable to think of me that way. Romantic relationships have started for me only after lengthy discussions on my religion, some didn't start at all because of the same and I am also aware that further intense struggles await me. I have also often been told “…par tu waisa nahi hai” after a barrage of insults about Muslims. I remember a friend of my girlfriend’s asking her during the planning of an outstation trip: “Yaar, can we go with a Muslim!”. I also remember that time when I was at an event in a College when students are supposed to be dressed by themes. I was wearing a turquoise Kurta and blue Jeans and this one student came up to me and asked: ""Tumhare group ki theme Al-Qaeda hai kya? Kurta pehena hai!!!"". To this day, I feel uncomfortable wearing a Kurta!

By this time in my life, I knew I was an atheist. Fiercely and irrevocably an atheist. I remember being on a trekking camp in Manali when some co-travellers asked me “Aap ka kya religion hai bhaiya?”, I said “Guess”. They tried everything from Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist, even 'Indian' and 'Human' but they couldn’t guess ‘Atheist’. I let it remain that way. I distinctly remember what one of them did when we returned to Ahmedabad. We got off the bus and were waiting for parents to come and pick everyone up. A boy kept nagging me: “Bhaiya, bolo na, kya religion hai aap ka?”, I kept playing around, avoiding. Soon after, his dad arrived. As he sat behind his father on his scooter and the scooter sped away, the boy turned around and screamed one last time: “BHAIYAAAA BOLO NAA KYA ANSWER HAIIII?????”.

Over the years, people in my family married Hindus, Christians, even a Dalit. I remember wearing a Sikh kada on my wrist out of some fascination I had once. I have kept a tiny Buddha statue in my pocket at times. There are idols of Hindu gods in my home that were gifted to me, there are gorgeous Madhubani artworks of Hindu lords we have, there is also a stunningly beautiful Janamaz (on which Muslims offer Namaz) in my home. I have been to many more temples in my life than to mosques, simply by not saying 'No' each time I've been on a tourist visit to a new place. Have accompanied people to temples and mosques when they asked me to, they would feel good they said and I didn’t mind!

Later, I started-up in 2012. I was the only founder out of the 3 co-founders who couldn't have his name on the office lease agreement, we wouldn’t have been allowed to get that place if I did. To this day, a lot of my Hindu friends in Ahmedabad have no clue about this long-lasting, cemented phenomenon and their shock never ceases to amaze me. Most 20 odd year olds today in at least Ahmedabad have hardly ever interacted with Muslims, because after 1992 and then 2002, most of the ghettoization is complete. Muslims escaped or were forced to leave to live only with Muslims and Hindus moved out to live only with Hindus. Pull up a map of Ahmedabad and I can show you exactly who lives where and there won't be more than a few countable exceptions. And not just Ahmedabad, my cousin in Bombay was made a product for TV debates on the one hand and right-wing trolling on the other when she expressed how it's been tough for her to get a home because of her religion. 

I also remember the time when one of my co-founders was warned by friends: “Be careful, you are about to get into business with a Miyabhai”.
After 9/11, plus lots of global terror attacks over the years and now Trump, I am sometimes told by friends ""Hey you have sometimes wanted to move to Silicon Valley, right? Do you think you will be allowed to now?"". Have had several debates with Muslim acquaintances online and offline about how killing innocents in the name of religion is plainly wrong and is also harming Islam itself! 'Islam isn't flawed, some of its practitioners are' has been a common answer. On a political note, ""Congress or BJP?"" has often been a question put up to me with a visible expectation of me saying the former. To this, a line I read somewhere on Facebook sums it up best: ""Main Musalman hu. Main marna nahi chahta. Is liye filhaal main corruption se kaam chala lunga"". 

After 2002, the Gaurav Yatras and more, a lot more got thrown my way but now it is made to seem as if it never happened. I remember this conversation a Gujarati Hindu gentleman was having with a curious non-Gujarati traveller in a train compartment I was sharing back in 2003. ""It was necessary to teach a lesson to these Muslims. They used to kill our Cows, they used to convert our daughters but now they are scared. Haan yeh aurato aur bachho ke saath thoda zyada ho gaya par overall theek hi hua."" When the other gentleman seemed to disagree and then went to the washroom, this guy told the others: ""Lagta hai Muslim hai!"".

Somewhere around last year, the Triple Talaq struggle my mother and her courageous colleagues were fighting for over 10 years picked up steam. Their interactions with tens of thousands of Muslim women across the Country had convinced them of the damage being propagated to women in the name of religion. That even the Quran - the holy book they all consider themselves reverent to, had no mention of Triple Talaq added further fervour to the fight. 

In response, hundreds of Muslim men, even some women would attack my mother and her colleagues at events, meetings, on TV debates. WhatsApp messages were broadcasted by the thousands about not just her but about her ""atheist son and Hindu husband"". Somewhere along the way Prime Minister Modi and the ruling BJP climbed onto the Triple Talaq bandwagon. Now those Muslims who felt threatened by my mother and her colleagues got a new weapon to target her with: “RSS Agent”. Life took a full turn, made a complete circle! And all of a sudden the same people we felt threatened by all our lives were being accused of being her friends and backers. Soon the political sloganeering and posturing died down but her struggle, their struggle continues and will keep doing so. Before writing this post, I called her to ask: ""Mumma, if I write a post about my relationship with religion, can it harm you or your work?"". ""Your thoughts are your own and they should absolutely be shared, fiercely and openly, don't you ever worry"" she replied instantaneously. The day I decided to drop my father's secular-sounding surname and use my mother's first name as my last name, I knew my identity shall become a lot more visible but it is too small a price to pay for the respect I want to give to her.

My latest tryst with religion was when I went to the #NotInMyName protest at Jantar Mantar just a few days back with my new employers/friends. Several innocent people had been lynched in the name of religion, this time the reason used was ‘Beef’. And then just a few days later, the terrorist attacks on innocent Hindu pilgrims on their way to Amarnath occurred and I remember the same old, familiar feeling coming back yet again!

Who am I fighting, who do I hate, they’re all the same regardless of their name or appearance, who is mine and who is the other, what is the solution, is there even one, is one religion the problem, are all religions the problem, is religion itself the problem, if religion didn’t exist wouldn’t the perpetrators just create something else to use!

Who do I belong to, do I belong to anyone, Who am I? But interestingly, the answer to these questions have been the clearest out of all the above. The others absolutely evade me.

Most of my good friends today are atheist or irreligious, most of them are scarred, most of them have stories of their own. I remain an observer to religion and this is an account of what all it has done to me so far! Let’s see what more you have to offer, dear Religion!

Courtesy: Arastu Zakia",modiusoperandi," Is this your own life story... Or fiction or Zakia's....?  All I will say is , thank you for sharing, it moved me. How many Muslims have KS Sudarshan or Haren Pandya on speed dial? So, accusations of being an RSS agent shouldn't be a complete surprise. And, these women organisations who were in forefront of Triple Talaq issue, where are they now? If not RSS agents, then they have been used by BJP and RSS for their political gains. I'm afraid Mr Arastu is yet another example of a relatively privileged person from Muslim background, who first has to prove to his readers why he is not a Muslim or very Muslim-lite, before talking about the injustices he personally faced or general anxiety he faces on account of some nouns or adjectives in his name. As a citizen of this country he shouldn't have to do that. It would be nice for people like him to talk about the meat of the matter for once directly.

I will add more. If People provide explanation that why we shouldn't read them, that will be better. 
It is not necessary that sources should belong to India. We can also discuss about BBC, the diplomat, IDSA, Washington post, huffington post, guardian and other internet resources (I am not implying that they are bad but we should discuss them)

I will add more. 

Some users pointed that there is no good journalism. But that's not right. There is a good journalism but we have to find it. I am creating these lists to help ourselves. As a conscious and educated citizens we have to be careful as much as we can. Sometime you can find a good article in the bad list and a poor article in the good list. Above lists are not strictly implying but providing a general idea for us to be careful. 
 ",Arjun_," So basically /r/india homepage should be avoided? /r/india I believe that if you're looking for a news source that's 100% unbiased, you won't find them. As well informed citizens and well adjusted people, the best we can do is read multiple sources of information and decide for ourselves where we stand on various political, social and economic issues...

I read both Kafila and Swarajya Mag. I form my own opinions and do not blindly take sides in politics. That's all.

Still, if I were you, I'd avoid all those new generation ""content creating"" websites that exist just to get more clicks and make profits from ad revenue. Examples would be: ScoopWhoop, DailyYo, Scroll, MensXP etc. tl;dr dont read anything Livemint is good journalism.  Should-read would make a shorter list.
Economic times is TOI minus the tabloid stuff.Washington post is a source I have always found to be balanced.For cultural perspective read the Hindu.Ignore it for economic stuff.Asia Pacific for defence and geopolitics. BC India ki toh koi site bachi hi nahin ab. All the sites that I know are there. The New York Times is good journalism? Kaunsi duniya mein bhaiyya? Their stories about India are generally trashy and look more like hit pieces than anything else. 

Also, as a ""right-aligned"" person, I find the Caravan excellent; their long-form pieces are pretty good. The Hindu, for all its left alignment, goes to great lengths to keep news and opinion separate. And their science and technology reporting is the best out there. For regular news too, your usual suspects (The Hindu, ToI, IE, HT, ET, NDTV, IBNLive) are fairly okay.

Among the newer publications, I quite enjoy reading Swarajya. They often publish articles by experts in various fields (Bibek Debroy, Syed Ata Hasnain, etc.) and other folks who either have several years of experience working in the fields they write about. Many of them wouldn't have found a voice in the regular mainstream media. The editing leaves much to be desired, but the content is quite alright. [deleted] well that's a huge fucking list. what are we supposed to read then? Add DNA India, The Logical Indian, Mili Gazette, Mid-day, The Statesman, Hindustan Times, New Indian Express, Daliyo, Story Pick to your list.

Edit: Outlook India and The Week Firstpost is the bane of existence. Everything from their news piece to movie reviews and political op-eds are based on sensationalism, so much so that sometimes they put TOI to shame. They are the self-proclaimed thought-leaders of new-age media, but with horrible taste for news. I especially hate their movie reviews; every snobbish mofo there is a wannabe Roger Ebert, with all talk but no substance. I don't know why people even read their stuff anymore.

Their general negativity was so repulsive that I unliked them from my fb to avoid their hateful feeds. There is no Good journalism. 

NYT is biased, India isn't its target yet. Guardian is relatively better but some of its guest editorials are down right moronic. 

Economist has a massive Anti-China bias, otherwise it has good content but one must never take it for good journalism.  
Same with TheDiplomat, massive anti-China bias.  

For domestic Chinese paper/mag, Caixin is best. I recommend reading http://www.thebetterindia.com and http://thealternative.in - Really good stories put out regularly. Add [project syndicate](http://www.project-syndicate.org/) too. You get great articles from highly qualified authors ranging from Jeffery Sachs, yanis varoufakis & Raghuram Rajan to Sashi Tharoor. There are rarely very long articles, but since most of the articles are by people who are some of the best in their respective fields, the quality is really good. wire scroll n fristpost Scroll.in, janatakareporter, firstpost, thewire.in, catch  Depends.

StartUp Beat Shanknaad pages and stories.  NitiCentral, OpIndia, TruthOfGujarat, CounterCurrents, indiasamvad.co.in, indiafacts.co.in  How is Indian express? The Telegraph is right wing, The Sun is a tabloid. Avoid anything from Rupert Murdoch. 

I read The Guardian but avoid their OP-ed posts. Oh I forgot Private Eye Magazine! They're consistently good & funny.

For Indian news, newslaundry seems alright so far.  [deleted] TOI website is actually quite good just they churn sheer numbers of news reports everyday some of them turn out to be shit but all in all they're quite neutral and good news source also add NYT and BBC in it because their India related news stories are heavily biased.

Edit - Dude NYT is not a good news source its the same paper which run the bullshit [Iraq has WMD stories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Miller) and in words of Noam Chomsky [NYT is pure propaganda](http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/noam_chomsky_the_new_york_times_is_pure_proganda_partner/). I like how entire publications can be written off by one user on an anonymous forum just saying two words. great work randia. truly

fwiw i agree with most of the OP's edited list I understand if a newspaper is biased towards a political idealogy that it manipulates news, then it should be considered bad source. 

But if the articles are well researched, should the alignment matter ?

Also few more to add to good reads list.

 * Newyorker (well researched long form articles)
 * The Atlantic (Entertaining, lacks substance, but good opinion pieces)
 * Granta (Good long form articles)

 I don't think any Indian newspaper left here which is considered good in randia. Reuters is a good source I like business standard.

I always found their news coverage to be adequate and relevant. Being a business newspaper, its coverage on personal finance, investing and observation of broad trends is good. Ignoring ultra biased Mihir Sharma, coverage of political news is minimal and mostly well grounded. Weekend issue has good lifestyle articles. You should certainly give it a chance. read the telegraph. really good paper, imo

for tech : android police is good, anandtech is good I would like to recommend Mint, Medianama and SpicyIP as sites that must be read. Also techcrunch? Seriously? I would recommend Recode and Anandtech instead. Also, could we please reclassify Newslaundry as media criticism + opinions instead of news?

Now coming to the political bias in the media mentioned in the first section. That is fine by me. I read them with the realization that they are biased just to get the view from the other side on several issue. I don't need to agree with ""them"" (the definition of them changes from topic to topic) or fight them; I just need to know how the other side thinks and feels about an issue. So do not restrict reading based on political biases. Bad clickbaity content  however should be avoided at all costs! That said, calling Buzzfeed clickbait becomes tricky as the news section has some good articles. http://www.buzzfeed.com/news You can say that Buzzfeed India is a bit clickbaity and they are unabashedly so.

PS: NDTV and IBN are yellow journalism? Do you even know what yellow journalism means? :D [deleted] Instead of targetting the negatives, can we have a list of good websites and blogs that do their niche thing or general thing (like news) While we're at it, can you guys tell me how do you prefer to read news on your smartphone? Used to read The Statesman when I was young. It was a great newspaper.

Surprised to see Caravan in the list of bad publications. It is easily the best article source I've ever read in India. It's features on Air India's destruction by Praful Patel, articles on the likes of Arvind Kejriwal, Arindam Chaudhary and Subramanium Swami were great.

The single greatest takedown of anyone I've read from an Indian source is this Caravan article on Suhel Seth.

http://www.caravanmagazine.in/books/age-seth Business Standard is a pretty good newspaper for financial news. Always found the articles well written; esp the opion pages.  India TV.  Good effort. Although it's usually a bad idea to eliminate major news sources. Know what their biases are and read different perspectives within reason. But obviously propaganda sources, govt mouth-pieces, tabloids, one-off blogs and social networks are really sketchy.

Good sources: 

International magazines/webzines: Economist (generally centrist, slightly right-wing economically) - it's not just a business magazine at least 50% is dedicated to international politics, Time (center-left), Salon (bit leftist).

BBC and Al-Jazeera get a lot of flak around here (""anti-india bias) but I've found most of their content excellent. Their documentaries are outstanding.

Vice (bit leftist) is a good documentary channel with a lot of current affairs.

Democracy Now is a good daily news broadcast, but sometimes a bit too leftist and conspiratorial.

John Oliver and Real Time with Bill Maher are good for US+intl politics, but remember they are comedy/satire shows. They're both pro-democrat.

From your current list, +1 for council for foreign relations and the diplomat. NYT, Atlantic are both great. Guardian is good, but some of their opinion pieces are occasionally absurdly left and sometimes borderline insane SJW territory.

Livemint is quite good (indian source, business news tilt). The Hindu, New Indian Express and The Telegraph are good newspapers with frequently excellent opinion pieces by guest authors.

I see a lot of people trashing Firstpost and scroll.in as being leftist. Like DailyO, these are a lot like blog aggregators, and it really depends on who is the author of the post you're looking at.

Sources to generally avoid:

 Most tabloids and almost everything with a conspiritard lean (ranging from globalresearch on the left to mediacrooks in india on the right). I'm not a fan of India today, in a lot of ways they try to sensationalize news and cater to what people want to hear. Times Now newshour is similarly just meant for entertainment, not a good source for anything. NTDTV, The Epoch Times, they are owned by Falungong, a religious cult, extremely biased against China. Add Zee news :P BBC for India related news is an atrocious source. The way they downplay incidents would bring tears of joy into the eyes of NDTV. What's left. I have no news sources now that I can use after seeing this list. :( Firstpost used to be the first site I check out each day. But stopped using their site completely some six months ago. Just sensational titles and complete bullshit in the articles. the indian express is both in the recommended list and in not recommended list Russia Today. It's basically a propaganda channel for the Kremlin.  firstpost.
Firstpost is not a real news paper.
It is just opinion in Trying to pretend to be better than other papers in use of English Language.
Scoopwoop.
The logical Indian..
Scroll I dislike the following for their agendas, lack of ethics, pretentiousness, lying, yellow journalism and various other factors  :

1) Scroll


2) Tehelka


3) Cobra post

4) jantakareporter

5) Kafila

6) Carvan

These all seem like some trash straight out of jhola of some JNU trash. The kind which wears kurta with chappals and drinks coffee in starbucks, gets drunk almost anywhere while abusing corporates


Among more mainstream:

1) TOIlet, is shit because all they know is to sell propaganda in guise of news.

2) The Hindu, so obvious left bias that it's not even funny. Pretends to be neutral, almost never accepts wrong reporting and in many cases, they just post whatever they can get away with. Their defence and science pages used to be nice. But haven't read the paper in years now.


3) Indian Express, Shekhar Gupta and Swamy are definitely on Paki payrolls. Manufacturing news like army coup to dishonour an upright general who firmly said no to corruption was just one of the lows this paper has gone to. Swamy is a perfect example of yellow journalism. Shiv Aroor when working for IE, routinely used to publish crap against armed forces, changed tone after leaving.


4) Hindustan Times, almost a complete Congress mouthpiece.




Among TV channels:

Any channel which employs Nidhi razdan, Barkha, Sardesai, Sagarika, Sreenivasan Jain and a couple of other soulless shameless turds of pressitutes. Includes NDTV, CNN-IBN and a few usual suspects.

 Thanks very much for this post! I raked up the courage to unfollow IBN and TOI from my Facebook. Personally speaking, they are sensational to the bone! Do add a few good media list too.  PRSIndia.org is good for legislation and parliamentary news. Is there any way to ban the websites reported here? by ban means not allowed to post on /r/india. Add dawn.com  it's a cesspool  Modi worshippers..(many) I blocked all these news sources long back on fb and twitter (so they actually see the impressions drop) and only subscribe to PTI/AIR and what other real people share.

I wish enough people block these sources using filtering so that they get the message and results in collective good. You forgot to add buzzfeed to the bad list (Clickbait)",Science/Technology,2015-08-18 14:57:39
[Serious] Seeking advice from r/India since most other places have foreigners who can not give proper answer,48,5rq4gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5rq4gj/serious_seeking_advice_from_rindia_since_most/,26,"Hello,

I am someone who wanted to do research for a living, physics specifically, but because of various circumstances was forced to do a bachelors degree in electronics and communications engineering in India. I had previously been in a markedly Western system and could not cope but was forced to finish the degree anyway. It took me 7 years to finish with reappear papers piling up over and over again and I am now 25 years old with a low undergraduate gpa (6.122/10). I am still interested in research but I don't know where to go now. I was hoping to do research in physics (and I still am) but after some discussions I may have to change things up a bit.

I've discussed a bit about what I've heard from reddit with my parents. As far as things go financially, I am pretty dependent on them. Now from the way the discussion went down last time, I get the feeling that they might be getting impatient what with me taking so long on my bachelor's already and from what they are letting on, I should either get into a program already or get a job soon. No preparation for exams or anything unless it is going to take 2-3 months or less. I don't know if that is enough time even if I were to study night and day. Besides, shouldn't I gain conceptual/research knowledge?

From the options I have gotten from Reddit, it basically boils down to mostly getting an MSc. I'd rather avoid doing it in India mostly because I am fed up with the educational system. People just learn how to parrot the textbook instead of actually becoming skilled in their chosen field but that may not be an option because of what I did. I pretty much just followed the curriculum. No extra curriculars/research experiences. Any practical laboratory work listed in my transcripts is pretty much on paper too. I mean it's not like I haven't handled a soldering rod, some circuitry, CROs and other small stuff but, then again, who hasn't? One redditor mentioned that because of this it may be easier to do MSc in India first, get research experience and attempting post baccalaureate courses to beef up my resume, then going abroad but as mentioned before, there is the issue of what my parents will and will not allow.

The problem comes due to the intervening periods. It doesn't help that my parents despite trying to act progressive are still limited by traditional thinking. I can't exactly blame them what with money being a relatively limited resource in our family and time passing by but that is not exactly helping with my long term plans. Due to this, theoretically, I cannot take the time off to prepare for exams for the universities such as JNU's physics MSc entrance exam or something nor will I be able to work on the post baccalaureate courses since they will take time AND money. Practically, I would probably have to work to find a job and as long as I don't find a job, I would keep preparing for the exams and what not but then I have to juggle that with trying to keep up with the knowledge required for the job that they will obviously test, if not outright rejecting me based on my grades, in some prelim exam and/or the interview. That or get a clerical job but I don't know if even that is possible because of the burgeoning population.

Now my first question to you guys is if some of the following fields might be easier to pursue research in. They may be somewhat related to both my bachelor's field as well as physics and I do have interest in them. I am not asking you guys to advise me about any of them but I am putting this out in case any of you know if it would be easier for me to go into research currently in any of those fields. Anyway, the fields are:

1. Quantum information science (computing, information theory, etc.) - Our field did involve conventional computing and information theory

2. Quantum devices/electronics, though I don't really much like the sound of this. I didn't realize there was a particular distinction between conventional electronics and quantum electronics. To my knowledge, standard electronics are based on our understanding of QM phenomena.

3. Photonics - Study of optical phenomena and derivative technologies such as optical waveguides, splitters, couplers, etc., was also focused on somewhat in my field

4. Photovoltaics/Renewable Energy Research in general - Photovoltaics is probably more the focus here. I put the second part there to emphasize my intention with research in it as well as tangential research interests.

5. Condensed Matter physics. This is more general than electronics so I don't expect it to be easier but just in case...

6. Physics of computers/information - not sure about this since it seems like it could fall into information theory

7. Dynamic systems theory (control theory, chaos theory, quantum chaos, etc.)/Study of Complex Systems - Our branch did have a lot to do with (mathematically) modelling various systems in many different ways, observing the effect of various inputs and feedbacks on the outputs.

My second question to everybody is, how would I accomodate my constraints, financial constraints being of particular note? Basically, I have to get into a program but seeing as that may be very unlikely, I may have to get a job instead. But I don't know if I can get anything other than a sub par clerical job with my degree and grades and I am not sure that would help me further my long term plans. To sum up, I am really confused about the next step to take. Please advise.",advic3s33k3r," Can't really help you with your first question regarding R&D in physics but: 

> how would I accomodate my constraints, financial constraints being of particular note? 

Have you ever looked into online tutoring? I know a few guys here who use a platform called Varsity Tutors to make side money but they will require SSN for background check so it's only applicable to US GC holders. I'm not sure what alternatives in India there are but you could look into that. 

If you can convince your parents, as money is an issue, I'd just finish MS in India or consider looking into options in Europe/Canada. Good luck! Can I ask which country are you planning to do your masters from?  You need to be bit more clear on your financial constraints.

If you do masters in India, like M Tech you would most likely be eligible for a stipend which help you to survive with an odd here or there but not your parents..IIT, IISC are good institutes for masters which will have way for research later in life...

If you are planning to take up research, unless it's in something like pharmacy your starting salary is bound to be limited initially, so need to be aware about that. 

You can also look for eligibility in newspaper for govt. postions for jr. Scientists and try to shape your carrier accordingly. >I am someone who wanted to do research for a living, physics specifically, but because of various circumstances was forced to do a bachelors degree in electronics and communications engineering in India.

Phunsukh Wangdu is that you?

 You are not going to receive funding from a US university in any of these research areas until you get a Masters degree from a top Indian university and graduate with either a stellar GPA or excellent research credentials with published papers in marquee journals. US universities, in general, do not look favorably on low undergrad GPAs. So you should first get into the best university you can, then find the lab in that university that has the best research output and then work in that as hard as you can. Keep an open mind about the exact field and look at getting experience. [removed] Donald Trump called,  he wants you to build him a wall. A wall of text.

What else can I career in apart from engineering?,8,781583,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/781583/what_else_can_i_career_in_apart_from_engineering/,8,"Hi all!

Over the past few years, I have become very jaded with computer science and engineering. Everytime I sit down to code for a job or assignment it feels like a meaningless task to me.  As a result, I find it tedious and I am not able to put in any effort that amounts to original work or learning. Computers have become boring to me! Moreover, I have developed cervical pain and think that I cant continue a career that requires me to sit in front of the computer all the time.

On the other hand, I have become more and more interested in the wider currents of the world covered in the social sciences like political economy or philosophy. Issues such as the impacts of technology, social organisation, policy,etc seem more important to me than the next great programming language or the iphone.

I am also interested in moving out of the country for reasons mentioned here - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/77z7a8/which_country_for_masters_and_further_job/

So, keeping all this in mind, what career can I move towards? Where can I train for it and which country would be a good choice to pursue it?

[AskIndia] Need education and career guidance from fellow r/Indians,14,7lw5ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7lw5ws/askindia_need_education_and_career_guidance_from/,3,"Hello fellow redditors

Let me start by sharing my educational and work background

* B.E in Civil engineering with 8.7 CGPA
* 3 years (1 year in UK) work experience in Indian IT firm - working in largest telecommunication firm as a analyst/developer

I am fairly strong in back-end (pl/sql) and basic programming concepts (worked with C, C++) and unix scripting and had a little time with VBA, Java, Javascript.
Though I am trying to learn new concepts/technologies I can't find the time for it with the day to day task and since the recent UK visa policy made 
the immigrants lot harder to enter UK,
I thought why not take a break and give a chance at full time masters(in computer science/data analytics) with the money I saved from onsite assignment. 
So with little research and help from friends who is doing masters abroad I finally decided germany would be the right place considering the next to nothing tuition fee.

Here's my questions

* is Germany the right pick or do you have any other suggestion (considering 0 tuition fees)
* Would my bachelor degree make it any difficult getting a seat in uni and later in finding work after the study
* Would I be doing my career a real harm (given that I am good at whatever I am doing right now) and lose all my savings if I don't find a job after study
* How are the job opportunities looking now in Telecom IT sector for a non EU national
* List of Universities with CS/Data analytics course in English :) - I will research on this later but would like to know your suggestions if any

"Hi/r/India, I am Govindraj of IndiaSpend along with Samar, Ask Us Anything",58,50sr6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/50sr6k/hirindia_i_am_govindraj_of_indiaspend_along_with/,46,"Edit: Logging off now, will answer more questions, if any, on Saturday morning.

About IndiaSpend:

IndiaSpend is the country’s first data journalism initiative. We use data to tell stories with the broader objective of improving the quality of public discourse. IndiaSpend was founded in late 2011 by Govindraj Ethiraj. IndiaSpend is increasingly an `agency of record’ when it comes to data and facts on the Indian economy, particularly in areas like education, healthcare, environment, energy and gender.

IndiaSpend is a non-profit and a project of The Spending & Policy Research Foundation located in Lower Parel in Mumbai, and registered as a Charitable Trust with the Charity Commissioner, Mumbai. 

Govindraj Ethiraj, Founder: He is a television & print journalist and also Founder of PING Digital Network, a next generation digital television initiative. He also anchors seasonal shows on Indian news television – the current one being the weekly `Policy Watch’ on public service broadcaster Rajya Sabha or RS TV. And most recent being BottomLine on Headlines Today – and writes for newspapers like Business Standard.

Previously, he was Founder-Editor in Chief of Bloomberg TV India. Prior to setting up Bloomberg TV India, he worked with Business Standard newspaper as Editor (New Media) with a specific mandate of integrating the newspaper’s news operations with its digital or web platform. He also spent around five years each with CNBC-TV18 & The Economic Times. He is a Fellow of The Aspen Institute, Colorado & a winner of the BMW Foundation Responsible Leadership Awards for 2014.

Samar Halarnkar, Editor: A journalist for 24 years working at publications like the Indian Express and India Today. His last assignment was Managing Editor of Hindustan Times, where he revamped the nationwide flow of news to focus on issues of public interest and ran groundbreaking investigations into poverty related multibillion-dollar subsidy programmes and administrative reform.

He continues as a columnist with Hindustan Times and Mint, writing on social and economic issues, science and technology. Most recently, he was a fellow with the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University, where he drew up a blueprint for mobile-phone-based, public-interest journalism model for India. He has also been a visiting professor at the University of California-Berkeley.

Halarnkar is the author of two books, “Nirvana under the rain tree”, an early chronicle of India’s Internet Revolution, and “A married man’s guide to creative cooking (and other dubious adventures)”, his experiments with cooking, which flowed out of a popular cooking column that he continues to write. He is married with a four-year-old daughter and lives in Bangalore.

",govindrajethiraj," Hi Govindraj and Samar. Thanks for doing this. 

I wanted to ask about this particular story IndiaSpend did on Delhi pollution which appeared in HT - [""Delhi’s pollution one-and-half times worse than Beijing""](http://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-pollution-one-and-half-times-worse-than-beijing/story-zGXWaA0sMG3nwTEeU59SaP.html). Apparently it was based on ONE data point in Delhi and ONE data point in Beijing.

> The analysis is based on a comparison of data generated by IndiaSpend’s #Breathe air quality monitoring sensor placed at RK Puram, Delhi with the one placed by the US government in its embassy at Beijing.

Don't you think the data analysis here is incomplete, and the headline is ""flawed"". The same flawed analysis was [picked up](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/beijing-pollution-smog-air-quality-environment-delhi-india-china-a6768611.html) by The Independent among others. [deleted] From painful experience - quality data sets on india are hard to come by. How (if at all) does this impact your work and what steps do you take to combat it.

Doesn't this limit the scope of DJ ?

What do you use/how do you guys clean and prep your data? Thank you all for your insightful questions and encouraging feedback...we will answer any further questions tomorrow morning by 10:00 AM IST [deleted] Hello! Thanks for doing this AMA  
1. What is one biggest misconception that you cleared, that you think is the most significant/interesting  
2.  What do you think of the current GDP calculation exercise?  
3. Do you have any suggestion to improve the way elections are reported and analysed?  
4. Which is the one area (in India ) where data journalism is needed the most?   
 Welcome! 

I'm sorry I can't articulate this question very well and I might be getting it all wrong, but - In your opinion in general, do you find that Indian systems of business commentary/think tanks/political commentary have started closely mirroring US structures? for eg. we see in US think tanks funded by special interest groups or with specific conservative or corporatist bents that produce analysis to the advantage of certain interests. do you see that happening in India too? Props for the #Breath initiative to monitor pollution levels in the country, its what inspired me and a friend to make [Earth Map](http://ocsidlab.github.io/earthmap/#4/21.15/79.08) on world environment day. Was very impressed to find open data and well documented APIs for this data. IndiaSpend is an awesome initiative! I hope other newspapers also follow the suit and do more data journalism. I do have some questions:

1) If I want to do data journalism, what is the path that you recommend, considering that I don't have any background in journalism, but I do work in the data analytics area.

2) Do you accept outside contributions for articles? Obviously after editorial review.

3) What tools do you guys use internally to do analysis?

4) Do you guys do any follow up research on the articles that you publish, and do some academic publishing?

5) Do you always use publicly available data sources like data.gov.in, or do you guys also file RTI requests?

Thanks for doing this, and in general for India Spend. Do you find any particular areas/sectors, in which getting relevant data is particularly hard? Really love IndiaSpend,

I really don't like the Indian Media as it is today, more sensationalism than substance, giving wide coverage to things that are not at all of national importance.

Indian Media should not be like 1st world country Media, because India is not 1st world country. Their priorities are different, while India faces massive 3rd world problems like Poverty, illiteracy, Malnutrition, quality Education, Urbanization etc., on a scale like no other country. Why does Mainstream Media cover Business so little when India is rapidly becoming a Market Economy.

Should media hold accountable on Policy issues with respective ministers and state Govt's rather than tit-for-tat silly politics, should Media work in nationalist interest because India faces such grave problems. what's your take on Media coverage of issues that's really matter. Are you hiring? Why is it named IndiaSpend? First of all thanks for doing this. I've read many of your pieces over the years and your data driven approach to journalism is quite refreshing in the present landscape. 

I have a few questions:

1. I'll be very honest. Most India spend articles I read are on other sites like Scroll etc. And I'm guessing they pick up stories which their editorial team thinks is the most relevant to their readers. Does cross publishing help readers discover your platform or is it harmful to the bottomline?


2. How difficult is it in our country to reach the masses with a purely data driven approach to journalism? Do you deliberately attempt to ""dumb down"" jargon or is that a strict no-no?


3. The risk with any data is that it can be interpreted variously by different people. Is it therefore difficult to maintain objectivity regarding conclusions you draw from data and how do you make sure that you stay away from ""I'm seeing what I want to see in the data"" kind of reportage? Really appreciate your efforts to clear up the ambiguity about lot of issues impacting us. 

1. What are some constructive ways your data has been used in?

2. What data surprised you the most and shattered common perceptions in that area? 


 First of all thanks for the wonderful initiative. I have 3 questions.  
1. How difficult to get right data as our system is not much supportive in collecting data ? What is the most difficult part ?  
2. How difficult is to remain unbiased while reporting issues ?  
3. Any particular case where the data based journalism has made major impact ?   I really have nothing worthwhile to ask at the moment(lots of good suggestions and questions already here) but i just want to say, *Thank You Guys* for what you are doing. Its appreciated immensely.  
We need this type of Facts-Only media journalism.  
Unfortunately we live in a world of Narrative/Story-based media journalism era, which is inherently prone to bias by its very design.  

I hope you set up a plan to safeguard your future revenue streams because being donations driven doesn't seem like a future proof plan to me. I hope you guys can sort this vulnerability in your project.  

All the best.  [removed]",Science/Technology,2016-09-02 19:30:00
What is the Job Profile of a Technology Analyst at a well reputed bank?,31,6r2po1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6r2po1/what_is_the_job_profile_of_a_technology_analyst/,7,"I was recently offered a position of Technology Analyst at a well reputed multi national bank. What exactly does a Technology Analyst does? Anyone who is in the same position, how was the job experience? What does the growth in this position look like in a few years?




Ps: I am a Computer Science Engineer and a fresher. This is going to be my first job.




Thank you for replying.",hamsterNotSloth," Answering the question with another question. Why don't you email them and ask them directly? Best case,  the HR contact should be able to put you in touch with the team you are going to join. Worst case, status quo.  Hard to say Technology Analyst is a broad term - in my company help desk support guys are Technology Analyst, their job is to ask me if I've turned it off and turned it on again..    
   
but, in my previous company, Technology Analyst used to do testing when we were deploying software, then he would help trouble shoot and update back end config.    
   
And at my client Technology Analyst was a sort of a requirement gathering person, he used to draw flow charts and fill out paper work for solution developers.    
   
Which bank is it? Who does the role report to? How do you have a job and have not seen a job description?  A tech analyst at a bank can mean anything - if you're at an investment bank / boutique advisory firm, then perhaps you could be looking at analyzing the Tech sector for investments and funding and for doing due diligence - which would then feed into the work of the actual dealing I-Banker.

If it is at a firm such as Goldman / Morgan etc, it could mean that you're working in the IT Deptt of the firm, solving tech issues or building custom solutions for the firm.

Look at the JD and perhaps the kind of questions you were asked in the interview would point to what the role would entail - If it was about algorithms and Java - you can be more sure of the latter scenarios, else it would lean perhaps towards the former. In any case, look at the JD or ask for one if they haven't provided already. You should ask your HR if you still can , rather than asking here. That said , you'll mostly be working on configuring software and systems for the bank , and/or writing new software for some narrowed down function of the bank. I'd say it's pretty boring , and being a compsci fresher , there are ""better"" places for you. Why are you even considering the role when you don't have clarity. Ask HR about this BEFORE you sign on anything. Also ask th about career growth path and opportunities  Why is this tagged demonetization",Science/Technology,2017-08-02 15:59:17
Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP],186,4i91ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4i91ig/kota_district_collectors_letter_to_the_parents_of/,40,"Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one’s child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child… Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No… They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children… Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say “Tip of the Iceberg” reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don’t mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts… your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better…psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors…could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child’ s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted… Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain… Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful…In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying… But there is a possibility of your child not liking you… This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have…) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you… I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo…

Children are parents’ responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so… Parents really think good for their children’s future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good… what is successful… what is the best thing… Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of…

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in “Right Child Care Practices” and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case…Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise “Your” dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care… Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times…Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child “to be” on his own terms and here I mean especially the child’s engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the timeâ€¦. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise “Your Dreams” at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises “His/Her” Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!

Request | Resources to make CRUD web app along with companion smart phone apps.,1,89k64d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/89k64d/request_resources_to_make_crud_web_app_along_with/,3,"Hello R/India, 

Since there are tech folks on this forum, i thought of posting this query here - 

**Context:**

1. I want to develop a CRUD website where –
    
    a. There will be category of items. 

    b. For any item - Users can leave comments and up-vote, down-vote other users comments.

1. I also want a companion iPhone and Android app for this service.
1. In the back-end, for administrators, there should be a way to generate reports (slice and dice user generated data) on – 

    a. User comments.

    b.  General category of comments 

    Etc.

**Request:**

1.	What technologies should I learn and use to make such a service?
2.	What is the best educational resource (paid or unpaid) to ramp up quickly on these technologies?
3.     If this is not the right forum, can someone suggest a better forum?. I am getting very little traction on my queries :(. 

**My background:**

1.	I have computer science background and work on enterprise hardware (and accompanying software). 
In the past, I have made simple HTML based websites. 
2.	I know programming in Python. In the past, I have done programming in Java, C, C++.

Text from the release,

**Cabinet grants ‘in-principle’ approval to the LIGO-India mega science proposal** 

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ‘in principle’ approval to the LIGO-India mega science proposal for research on gravitational waves. The proposal, known as LIGO-India project (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory in India) is piloted by Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Science and Technology (DST). The approval coincides with the historic detection of gravitational waves a few days ago that opened up of a new window on the universe to unravel some of its greatest mysteries. 

The LIGO-India project will establish a state-of-the-art gravitational wave observatory in India in collaboration with the LIGO Laboratory in the U.S. run by Caltech and MIT. 

The project will bring unprecedented opportunities for scientists and engineers to dig deeper into the realm of gravitational wave and take global leadership in this new astronomical frontier. 

LIGO-India will also bring considerable opportunities in cutting edge technology for the Indian industry which will be engaged in the construction of eight kilometre long beam tube at ultra-high vacuum on a levelled terrain. 

The project will motivate Indian students and young scientists to explore newer frontiers of knowledge, and will add further impetus to scientific research in the country.

PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,44,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc. 




TLDR: Nope! Read it.",r_india_mod," Okay, for whom this is directed towards?  [removed] Does it actually help? Just asking out of curiosity,  I feel it's just another unnecessary step which has no real purpose and is a pain for mobile users,  * please don't ban me :D *  > TLDR: Nope! Read it.

Isn't that trolling? Shouldn't your post get deleted as this is Reddiquette flaired? Non-political. Why can't this just be 'Others'? Thank You. This was very helpful.  > Scheduled: For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions.

What about daily? A certain daily *ahem* thread.. I honestly never remember what Rediquette means. Can you change it to Serious or something? Also using Non political as a Misc. seems a little misguided. Why not just Misc This is quite intensive. Thanks mods.  Any specifics for device users? We should have a RTE flair.

Even Russia and America are funding space programs and if ISRO is more successful than other counterparts then you definitely have to give the credit to the workforce and brilliant minds at ISRO.
 Yes, let's take a moment to play politics over it. Of course, sing Nehru bhagawan's praises and bash the evil Modi! Can't expect any better here.

ISRO was established 7 years after Nehru's death and was a small organization in its early days. Most of its achievements starting with the Aryabhata satellite actually happened long after Nehru's era. Hey **/u/congress4life** Let's forget politics and keep aside your congress bhakti for a moment and appreciate the scientists who's efforts resulted in ISRO. If you want a visionary to praise, why not Kalamji? here's a quote from the great man:


  ""Many individuals with myopic vision questioned the relevance of space activities in a newly independent nation, which was finding it difficult to feed its population. Their vision was clear if Indians were to play a meaningful role in the community of nations, they must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to their real-life problems. They had no intention of using it as a means of displaying our might.""

Todays corruption in Tomorrow's Reputation Economy,47,4i362m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4i362m/todays_corruption_in_tomorrows_reputation_economy/,22,"Hey India!

I'm a Canadian with big interest in globalized prosperity. I'm a /r/futurology moderator, and all technological trends are pointing to a great future that is already beginning to take hold. As you know, Artificial Intelligence has been exploding lately, and is no longer science fiction. They're beginning to sift through massive swaths of computational data, and with evolving sensory upgrades such as natural language processing and machine vision, they'll be gathering data on ourselves. With the sharing and reputation economy unraveling, I think its very important for people to start thinking and acting more rationally and compassionately. The corruption going on in your government will begin being chipped away, and I think the earlier you guys realize this, the better. So I'd like to take this moment to open up a dialogue so that more people can become aware of how technology is going to play into the ongoing evolution of our growing interconnected society.  ",Chispy," 
Corruption stems from a culture of scarcity and poverty. Its not imposed top down by a government.

300 million Indians don't have access to electricity. About the same number are illiterate even by our very lenient standards. 

Countries with several times our GDP per capita suffer from corruption. Its not going away anytime soon. Corruption is more often not the cause but the effect of the problems  that India faces. Your post is basically future bakchodi without any basis regarding the ground reality of this nation. It's a good thing you're trying to start a dialogue but for that to happen, both parties need to know what they're talking about first.  I am interested to know how AI is a solution to corruption and more importantly how your govt is using it. Can you share some insights. It does not only apply to AI but technology and automation of the most processes. Computing systems cannot be corrupted, only humans who build and use them. For instance, if you wanted a BSNL telephone line in 90s you would have to spend close to 10K for one line to get it in time. Today, you just have to make an application and they will connect it at your place. 

Same with booking railway tickets. Since my family travels a lot for business, I had to stand in a queue for long hours and the frustration led to some fights with touts. It is so much easier now thanks to Technology. Be smart and start leaving comments everywhere praising Artificial Intelligence

When our Robot Overlords come, they'll see that you love AI and will let you live.

Arun. P.V. who hails from from Manimala in Kerala, got an invitation from the American space research center NASA to work as scientist there. He had completed his M.Tech from Bhopal NIT and after a stint at the renowned Bhabha Atomic Research Center, he completed a PhD at the Masachussetts Institute of Technology. While at the MIT, NASA Extended the invitation. Arun joined work on a fixed term contract.His exceptional caliber and genius led to an offer of a permanent position at NASA.

All other candidates who were invited by NASA for a permanent position, accepted US Citizenship, and joined NASA. However, Arun was adamant that he would not give up his Indian Citizenship for the job. His stand was that if that was the condition, he was more than willing to forego the offer from NASA. He informed NASA that he was willing to quit and return to India if his condition was not acceptable by NASA.

NASA and the US Government must have been very impressed by his patriotism as well as his scientific caliber from what happened afterwards. Arun, a very junior scientist, was included in a high level science and technology co-operation delegation from the US to India that arrived two weeks ago. It was renowned computer scientist Dr. Barbara Liskov, who was also on the delegation, who informed Home minister Rajnath Singh about the courageously patriotic stand that Arun had taken.

Rajnath Singh updated PM Narendra Modi about this, and the PM invited Arun to his official residence for a half hour chat. He told Arun that the doors to the Indian Space research programme will forever be open to him.

TIL- India spends ~1000 Crore Rs. an year on Department of AYUSH (aka Department of Bullshit),42,2i5qkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2i5qkk/til_india_spends_1000_crore_rs_an_year_on/,127,"So India just allocated **Rs. 1272 crores** for the Department Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy,Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) for the 
financial year 2014-15. For reference, the amount India has allocated for the Department of Science and Technology for the same period is around Rs. 3544 crores.

http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2014-15/eb/sbe48.pdf

Can someone please do a cost-benefit analysis of pumping money into research in these areas? Has *anything* of any value at all has ever come out of funding this department? If not, can we close these institutes and these departments and just put the tax-payer money into *real science*. You know, things like ISRO, TIFR and IISc where scientists do some actual work. Just doing this would increase the funding available for this department by  **over 33%**!!

EDIT:

1. Source for funding of Department of Science and Technology - http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2014-15/eb/sbe86.pdf
2. **It seems to me now that I was a bit quick in my outrage.** DST is only one of several departments of Ministry of Science and things like TIFR, BARC, HRI, IMSc get funded through the Department of Atomic Energy while ISRO is funded through Department of Space. According to this [source](http://www.nature.com/news/first-modi-budget-spells-austerity-for-indian-science-1.15542), **the total budget of all departments under Ministry of Science was just above Rs. 36,000**.",baby_kochamma," Can we first seperate Homeopathy and Naturopathy from Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha? Done? Ok. Good. 

**Naturopathy** - is prevalent all over the world. There is nothing uniquely Indian about it. It's something universal and a form of alternative medicine.  Not Indian but popular in India. 

**Homeopathy** - Again, not Indian. Controversial and no scientific backing whatsoever. It **probably** thrives on the placebo effect and works because of that. Very popular in India as a form of alternative medicine. 

**Ayurvedia, Yoga, Unani, Siddha** - They're Indian and are a form of alternative medicine that are attached to our tradition and culture. It's definitely popular and one of our biggest exports. 

Now here's the thing, I wouldn't mind if our Government spends money to protect Ayurvedia, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and promote it not only in India but abroad too along with research. There are way too many patent trolls out there trying to patent Yoga and Ayurvedic treatments. These are uniquely Indian and need protection, promotion and many more scientific studies to prove various claims about them. I would like the government to do that instead of spending on Homeopathy which has nothing to do with India. 

Also can we not drag religion into this? You are making the whole discussion trivial when religion gets dragged into it. 

Whether you support these alternative forms of medicine or not, fact is they are popular here and we need to safeguard our assets, research and promote them instead of ridiculing them simply because a large part of our population believes and uses it. I'm all for science and scientific research but let's not ridicule it like how kulcha warriors ridicule every discovery from the 'western world'.

"IMO: To those in r/india who think “Statue of Unity” cannot be justified, here is my opinion. feel free to provide counter-arguments..",27,2hhqos,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2hhqos/imo_to_those_in_rindia_who_think_statue_of_unity/,126,"Here is what i think of it. you can provide your opinion.. 

1)	Justifying that MOM was 1/4th of the projected cost of “statue of unity” is wrong because MOM’s cost was low not because of the budget cuts, but because of cheap technology in India, because we can do it.  Although I do think ISRO should be getting more from the government, it doesn’t mean that money should come from statue of unity.

2)      Remember, this project is mostly being carried out by Gujarat govt. So if you're thinking the tax money of people outside Gujarat will be used, it won't. 

3)	Statue of Unity is not just a simple stuatue. First it will be the tallest statue in the world .Then, there will be a lot of things inside the statue. This will include elevators to go to the top of the statue where there’ll be an panaromic observation deck at about the head of the statue. It’ll also include a museum and small theatre that depicts the history of India. Alongside, there’ll be laser show, underwater aquarium, ferry services, research center, restaurants and stuff. Please check at their website.

Here's a link: http://www.statueofunity.in/statue-of-unity-project-features.html

4) the statue will be located almost at the meeting point of gujarat, maharashtra and madhya pradesh.. hence, increasing local tourism.. 

5)	Remember, this project will be mostly financed by Gujarat. Gujarat has decent manufacturing, decent agriculture, but has a very small share of India’s tourism sector. Modi has been trying to boost tourism in Gujarat for a while with bringing in Amitabh Bachchan for advertisements. But they know this statue will significantly improve the tourism to Gujarat. 

6) You can't just spend all the money on one thing, and leave the other thing aside. Everything has to grow together, so tourism and science also has to grow together. If you think the statue is not going to boost tourism, then think about this:

these were all built many decades ago when these countries where at the stage even not as developed as india is now.. and also remember, it's cheaper to make the statue now than say in 20 years, because it'll cost billions then due to much much higher gdp (even after considering inflation).. 

given the number of things that is being built, i wouldn't be surprised if the cost goes above projected cost, but i think it'll be worth it in coming years.. 

EDIT: thanks to those people who gave reasonable explanation. It was a good brainstorming exercise. ",chantuaurbantu," TIL about the st. louis arch. thanks I am afraid that this would lead to dick measuring contest between our states itself. Maharashtra government is already planning a statue for Shivaji in the Arabian sea. [deleted] A lot of justification for the Unity statue comes from people who say it is like Eiffel tower and Statue of Liberty. One needs to understand that New York City is not famous because Statue of Liberty is located there. Instead, the statue is famous because it's in NYC. The same goes for Paris and Eiffel tower. 

NYC is the center of the earth in many ways - lots of foreigners visit the city either for business or for holiday (no trip to the US is complete without visiting the mecca of US itself). And the statue of Liberty is no doubt an embellishment to the city - and has thus generated a lot of revenue. 

On the contrary, the status of Unity is located in a place that is not known for travellers. It can be justified at least if it was in Mumbai or New Delhi since these places already see a lot of migrant population and they will all want to visit the tallest tower while there. 

It is not related to a religion or cult - at least in this case, you will have all the followers flocking to it. It's the statue of a great Indian leader, no doubt. But who wants to travel hundreds of miles to see the statue of a freedom fighter when we have one in every corner of our city - not as tall, but Indians are numbed to statues already.

If you want to justify the statue through ROI, let's talk about it from a business perspective. If I want to open the best pizza place in town, I will not build the biggest pizza restaurant outside the city and expect everyone to travel two hours to come and eat. Instead, I will build a small one within my means in the heart of the city so I can make use of the footfalls to grow my business. 

The statue of unity is a poor and unjustifiable cost both emotionally and economically.  [deleted] > this project is mostly being carried out by Gujarat govt. So unless you're gujarati

I'd rephrase that as ""unless you *live* in the state of Gujarat. A Gujarati who's settled in the US wouldn't care. Whereas any non-Gujurati living in Gujarat and paying local taxes would.   I wish it were more action-y. Of all the 'big' statues, The Motherland Calls is far and away my favourite because of the awesome posing. The Statue of Liberty is carrying a torch (which actually seems alight) and a book, walking forward, looks cool, especially against the Manhattan skyline. Christ the Redeemer is on a mountain in the classic arms outstretched pose - I mean, [look at that location](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Christ_on_Corcovado_mountain.JPG), like he's watching over the world. Not a big fan of Spring Temple Buddha - Does have the whole hands thing going for it, but overshadowed by hills behind, makes it seem less dramatic. I mean, [look at this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cab7WSb4HxQ/TdMB1Oh1npI/AAAAAAAAFKY/FMlm5ncWwjk/s1600/a_maior_estatua_do_mundo_china.jpg).

People say that you can't make it that big without having it have that shape, but maybe then we shouldn't make it that big. Make it cool. Like the whole standing in the middle of water thing? That's cool. But the posing is still lacking. I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, but fuck it.

1. Space research is in no way comparable to generating tourism. The two industries don't work the same way. Launching an orbiter to Mars is a concrete achievement that puts ISRO in a tiny group of space-capable organisations. This translates into increased revenues for ISRO because it is now much more credible as a satellite launch partner. Besides, even if the mission did not generate extra revenue, the technical and scientific know-how gained during the project itself is worth the money spent on it. A successful MOM validates ISRO's research and allows our whole space program to progress. There is no proof at all that the statue will generate tourism. Nor, to my mind, does it bring any intangible benefits. I say this because we already have a lot of monuments dedicated to freedom fighters, none of which are visited in any great numbers. How many people visit the Amar Jyoti, or Gandhi's house, or the Jalianwallah Bagh memorial? Why will this statue be any different? And to preempt the two arguments you have repeatedly used in this thread: The onus is on *you* to prove that it will bring increased tourism, not on me to prove that it won't. You are the one making the positive claim here. Secondly, you have been repeatedly asked to back your claims up with a feasibility study, which you have not done so far. My suspicion is that even if such a study has been done, it has been kept secret because I believe it will show that the entire project is a giant waste of money.

2. Fair enough, if the Gujarati people want their money to be spent this way, then that's their choice. I still have a right to my opinion though, and I can still question the feasibility of the project even though I don't have a personal stake in it.

3. Every project can be sold on its strong points, I don't doubt it will be a magnificent statue if it gets built. The question is whether this alone justifies the insane amount of money being spent on the project. From a purely economic standpoint, I'd say no. That brings up the question of whether the other intangible stuff people are touting is worth this money. To my mind it isn't, because I find the idea of building giant statues of people to be extremely distasteful. I deeply respect Sardar Patel, but I don't think he himself would have wanted the nation to turn his memory into a cult. Besides, the statue is in the middle of nowhere, so I don't see how having the laser show, aquarium etc. in the complex will help. These things turn the greatest revenues when they're located in large moetroplises where lots of people with disposable incomes can commute to it easily. Also, having a research centre in the middle of nowhere is senseless, unless it is actually essential for it to be in a deserted area like this. I don't see any evidence for this.

4. State boundaries are meaningless, just because the statue is located near the state boundary of Maharashtra doesn't mean Marathi people will flock to the statue. Like I said, tourist attractions work best when people with large amounts of disposable income can commute to them easily. This statue is outside the city limits of Vadodra, 2 hours from Ahmedabad, 5 hours from Indore and 7 hours from Mumbai. All of this seriously reduces the number of potential visitors.

5. You can't just build massive buildings in the middle of nowhere and expect it to boost tourism. Generating tourism requires infrastructure development, publicity, a functional law and order mechanism, easy licensing for hotels, restaurants, commercial centres etc. Gujarat, like the rest of India, cannot hope to be a tourist hub until it develops all this. And even if Gujarat did boast first class infrastructure, why would people flock to Gujarat to see a statue? There are many, many better ways to develop tourism in the state.

Gujarat already has the Rani Ki Vav listed a a WHS, and Lothal, the historic centre of Ahmedabad, Dholavira and the sites of the Satyagraha are all on the tentative list. There is no reason why the Gir national forest could not be placed on this list too. All this already presents fantastic opportunities for tourism in Gujarat, and Rs. 3k crore would go a long, long way towards developing the infrastructure that would make these sites tourist traps. Why spend it all to develop a brand new tourist attraction that nobody outside India will care about?

6. I agree that science and tourism has to grow together. That does not mean that this project is the only possible way to boost tourism. In fact it's not even a very good way to boost tourism, as is proved by the list you provided: Paris is also home to several museums including the Louvre, a celebrated culture and busy nightlife. NY is home to Times Square, several famous skyscrapers, and also boasts a very active nightlife. Rio de Janeiro has the Copacabana, several other beaches, and again, a very active nightlife. Toronto has several zoos, art galleries, famous sports teams, and an active nightlife. St. Louis has famous sports teams, zoos, museums and an active nightlife. See the common link? All these monuments were built in cities that were already tourist traps. Tourists don't travel to a place because there is only one monument there. They go to see a city and experience everything they can there. Why would they come to see a statue in the middle of nowhere? At least, if the statue was located in Ahmedabad, you could argue that it would add to the attractions already in the city. But it is in the middle of nowhere, the closest city being one which is not really visited at all. That is why I don't think it'll work. Also, it's a fallacy to say that those other monuments were built when their home countries were not developed. Paris, NY and Toronto were already among the richest cities in the world when they got their monuments. the arch in St. Louis was built in 1965. Rio is the only example where you could say it was a relatively poor country getting a monument, but then the monument was privately funded. None of those cases are similar to this one.

From all points of view, it simply does not make sense to build the statue where it is being built. It would make marginally more sense if it was built in a large metropolis, but even then it would be a giant money sink without providing much in the way of returns. If you can provide me with a feasibility study that can prove that the money from the statue will be recouped, I will gladly cede to you, but I'm betting you can't do that. If you can't I will ask you to do me a favour and accept one thing: In my opinion, neither you, nor Modi, nor any of his supporters care about the tourism generated by this statue. 

Everything you have written here is a post facto justification that still does a very poor job of hiding what I believe are your real intentions: this statue is an *ideological* project first. By building this massive statue of Sardar Patel, Modi wants to make a massive ideological statement first. The tourism and other stuff is just a way to sell the project to as many people as possible. That is why I am primarily against the building of the statue, I think spending so much money on an ideological statement is tasteless and does Modi the statesman and policymaker discredit. He has shown a lot of pragmatism during his time as CM of Gujarat and PM, and has shown he genuinely wants to work for the common good. I don't understand why he pairs this pragmatism with grandiose gestures like this. I support his economic policies, but his ideological posturing makes me uncomfortable.

That is why the whole statue thing makes me uncomfortable. > You can't just spend all the money on one thing, and leave the other thing aside

Agreed. I don't have problems with the statue itself. But why does it have to be SO BIG ? Surely it is not a binary decision of either not building the statue or building the statue at such a large scale. The grandness of the scale makes it look like a decadent indulgence, indecent and disrespectful.

> Modi has been trying to boost tourism in Gujarat

Let me be honest. I wouldn't tour UP for Mayawati statues, and neither would I tour Gujrat for a Sardar Patel statue. If someone is interested in architecture, they would tour buildings of historical importance, such as ancient temples, forts etc. Or places of natural beauty.

Also, the places that you mentioned, such as Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty, Christ statue etc. are important because they are historical and in pop culture, have become icons associated with those places. Kinda like how Taj Mahal is the iconic symbol of India (despite India being rich in other historical places, but no one gives a shit). 

> Then, there will be a lot of things inside the statue. This will include elevators to go to the top of the statue where there’ll be an panaromic observation deck at about the head of the statue. It’ll also include a museum and small theatre that depicts the history of India. Alongside, there’ll be laser show, underwater aquarium, ferry services, research center, restaurants and stuff. Please check at their website.

This looks promising. If it's like an amusement park that shows Indian history, then more money should go towards this, rather than the bare-statue itself. I don't like the whole idea of ""biggest statue"". Sounds like a dick-measuring contest with other countries more than anything else, especially since China recently did the same thing with a giant-ass Buddha statue and faced severe criticism.  > and also remember, it's cheaper to make the statue now than say in 20 years, because it'll cost billions then due to much much higher gdp (even after considering inflation)..

wah wah. kya logic hai bhai TL;DR

Blah Blah tourism. Blah blah more tourism blah blah. Blah Blah moar fucking tourists. Lifting the alcohol ban would just be cheaper. All the examples you suggested above are of ideas, not people and ideology. (Except Jesus Christ, but that's a different category altogether) 

Think of any statue of a 20th century figure you can recall. It's difficult without it being something like a Stalin, Lenin, Saddam, Che, etc. 

Granted, the scale of the statue will transform it into a idea, a spectacle, a symbol, of a man who played an important role in uniting India, but it still remains parochial, political (in that it is somewhat anti-Congress), and needlessly expensive.  > Unless you live in UP, you shouldn't have problems with mayawati's statues and parks. There was an article posted either here or on /r/bharat detailing how there is not enough high grade material (steel or iron, not sure which) to build this statue in the entire country. 1) Fodder scam (Chara ghotala): Equivalent to US$410 million in 2014.

2) Statue of Unity: US$410 million. 

The truth is, this is a huge waste of money. 

 I am all in for this statue but

>Remember, this project is mostly being carried out by Gujarat govt. So unless you live in the state of Gujarat, you shouldn't have problem.

Whatever.  How about this OP: we spend the 3k crores or fuck it we spend 30k crores in building 100 super speciality hospitals of 1000 bed each. 

Then we spend 10k crores in making regular roads, power plants and infra. 

Then suddenly, boom: employment for about million+ people and beds for 100k troubles souls. 

Bang, we just made the life of a lot of people easier. 

Easier said than done, easier said than done and I agree. But why aren't we having an argument on hospitals and roads ? Why the fuck are we suddenly prioritizing a statue which comes so low on our list ?

That is the reason we all stand pissed.  >rst it will be the tallest statue in the world .Then, there will be a lot of things inside the statue. This will include elevators to go to the top of the statue where there’ll be an panaromic observation deck at about the head of the statue. It’ll also include a museum and small theatre that depicts the history of India. Alongside, there’ll be laser show, underwater aquarium, ferry services, research center, restaurants and stuff. 

I want this in India. It would be super cool. as you said It will increase tourism. 

It will give an icon for India. as long as they can keep it away from religious nuts (hint hint Taj Mahal, it could be so much better if they opened on Fridays). > Justifying that MOM was 1/4th of the projected cost of “statue of unity” is wrong because MOM’s cost was low not because of the budget cuts, but because of cheap technology in India, because we can do it

cheap technology - it's because people have applied their brain-lives to it , not some cut and paste code job. Just wiki the team profile of MOM's team -> all were graduates from GECs in 70s , do you think GECs are now producing the same level of graduates , nopes !! - ISRO's achievement shouldn't make us complacent about our education disaster , we are producing skill-less graduates , our demographic dividend will last next 3 decades , if you don't utilise it well , we are gonna get screwed , 
Thus , statue of ~~liberty~~ unity is a fucking waste of money reeking of populism . [removed]",Science/Technology,2014-09-26 10:38:36

Why Entrepreneurship is the best way India can solve it's problems,32,4gguue,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gguue/why_entrepreneurship_is_the_best_way_india_can/,19,"Sometimes Indians don't realize how much poverty there is in India. Most of the India's population lives like a fish in the pond where fish thinks pond is the world the problems India faces is staggering only wealth creation can solve it.

Reality is, India has more people living in extreme poverty than any other country in the world in fact we have more than 30% of worlds poor people.

Overpopulation is huge problem in the country, it's already too late to control it. we are now 1.3 billion people with adding 14 million people every single year, even if fertility rates fall to 1 tomorrow we will still have 1 or 2 million adding to present 1.3 billion. For comparison India with UK which has bigger GDP, India has 1.22 billion people more than UK. We are adding population of Australia every 18 months.

India has just seen a small taste of Climate Change in last 2 years. Climate Change is gravest danger India is facing today forget in the future.

**Entrepreneurship**

To tackle Overpopulation, Climate change, Poverty there is only one thing could overcome it Entrepreneurship with clean energy technology. Only wealth creation and job creation can solve India's hard problems.

we need to change our mindset towards business, our culture needs to change towards encouraging entrepreneurs. For far too long we treated businessmen like criminals. In today's India everybody with talent can become an entrepreneur Seed funding, Angel investors, small bank loans for business are all available. we need to create 13 million jobs every year for next 20 years at least.

We need to teach every person in India about Entrepreneurship:

1. Increase 100's of top class Business schools in the country.

2. Compulsory Entrepreneurship programs in schools/colleges having Score/marks like science, maths and languages.

3. Funding programs for business ideas for MSME's, startup incubators.

4. From self- employment to employing 10-100 or even 1 lakh companies need to be taught how to manage talent.

We need to revolutionize Education and Healthcare. Introducing new technology in manufacturing and services. 

Our politicians are dumb and incompetent can't rely on them to solve our problems it's everybody in the society and private sector which will solve it. we need to get govt out of our way and demand ease of doing business.

In conclusion the best way to solve India's problems Overpopulation, climate change, Water crisis, Job creation is Entrepreneurship.",wastui," Yes! Self employment and job creators are the only saviours for this country. And that culture has to start from school. Kids need to be encouraged to take risk, start an enterprise, learn about managing money, negotiation skills. 


 Very few VCs will invest in such societal problems. Everyone just wants to get rich. The problems you mentioned are important but doesn't have good ROI. What steps OP has mentioned will not have much traction, instead need  
http://colony.io. for India.

I am thinking of combining UPI, blockchain, AR, p2p  services into what's known as market networks.

http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/27/from-social-to-market-networks/


The notion of job for income or business for profit will become obsolete.

There are better methods for livelihoods emerging. There is no alternative to Quality Education. BC - nothing you said here will help.

Read PGs essay on what is value. Unless the poor can contribute to the economy in a manner that allows them to trade value-  no high level entrepreneurship is going to make.

You need help and entrepreneurship at the lower levels, not in colleges Most of india are in entrepreneurial businesses with variable pay - farming,  vegetable vendors, dhobi, roadside shops/stalls etc.

Most of Indian economy is small startups by reluctant entrepreneurs. You uploaded this yesterday night too didn't you ?

"There is a real lack of good science journalism in India, and this leading to poor information for those make decisions nationally. I decided to take small step to fix that. What do you think?",112,26s7s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/26s7s3/there_is_a_real_lack_of_good_science_journalism/,68,"In 2011, I [conducted](http://www.criticaltwenties.in/sciencetechnology/indian-science-in-the-media) an informal survey of newspapers in India and realised that none of them cover science stories properly. A lot of their coverage relied on taking stories from international wire services. These were ok for hard science stories, but failed to help readers when it came to health, environment or even technology reporting. The [example](http://akshatrathi.com/2014/05/25/an-attempt-at-setting-the-information-balance-right/) of India's minister using dubious facts forwarded as hoax email to talk about the achievements of IITs makes the case clear.

With some friends, I formed a group to do something about it. We had lots of ideas, but most of them required a lot of money or time. However, one idea seemed attractive: building something that curates science stories on the web that relate to India. While no Indian publication does a decent job, many of them put together with some international publications generate some great stories.

So we've built [Curious Bends](http://tinyletter.com/curiousbends/), a newsletter that would curate such stories once a week. The first two editions are [here](http://tinyletter.com/curiousbends/letters/curious-bends-supersonic-rails-nutritious-millets-nuclear-bombs-and-more) and [here](http://tinyletter.com/curiousbends/letters/welcome-to-curious-bends). 

What do you think about it? Is there something we can do to improve? Do you have other ideas to improve the state of science communication in India?",akshatrathi," Seems interesting. Subscribed. WOOHOO. The newsletter just got featured on The Atlantic: http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/regulating-new-organisms/371819/

It was this 5 Intriguing Things newsletter that inspired me to start Curious Bends. Why don't you expose the science journalists who get paid in India. Do some proper muckraking. None of this stuff seems original enough to attract well-red people. Good effort, but as you know many such efforts exist. If you want something to do with science journalism, bring down the fake empire that is the typical ""Indian Science Congress"". Do not allow those devils to pat themselves on their backs. Go critical on them. The incompetence of people in that network is shameful. 

Besides stop throwing articles, that's too passive and hands-off. You are not trying to create a museum for science. Rather do yourself a favor and disclose questions in science that you have never thought you would ask. If you want science journalism, keep asking questions so that the reading audience is overwhelmed by questions. Put a 1000 unique questions in your next newsletter, and I'll be pleased. Otherwise, you are copy pasting old models. 

All the obligatory thumbs-up for being enterprising though. But its not delivering. Besides you haven't go too much of the click-bait or comedic elements. I would only enjoy science ""journalism"" when it comes on a comedic platter.  All of this is too peculiar, and you have more validating focus-groups and more sanguine market-research to back you up. But you're not doing anything cute or even artsy-fartsy. It is good.Have some form of line separating the articles  it looks like faq.plus have a picture on one side than for next article on another.alternating.Good effort.Best of luck.

EDIT:i would also suggest to have some infographics.Just for example what is a randomised control trial.so that people could understand how legitimate science is tested.a very simple infographic will do. I think you're taking /u/gitacritic's criticism at face value and getting a little defensive. I've often felt the same feelings he feels but he is unable to articulate in a more palatable manner. Let me try to rephrase some of his criticisms that I agree with. 

1. Most science writing in India is boring as fuck. The Hindu, for instance, has amazing agriculture content and often has very interesting topics in the science pages but these are not written for the layman. Forget comedic element. Much of science writing in India is not fun to read and often fails to fill the reader up on context and background.  

2. There is almost nothing that is based on work that is done inside the country. Take the bio-toilets being developed by DRDO for example, the only sections of TOI and The Hindu that covered it were the news / reportage sections and not (to my memory) the science pages (TOI doesn't even have science page I think). Why didn't someone go and interview the scientists and write a little longer, easier to read, magazine style article with asides, anecdotes and built a narrative around the event (like a lot of major Western magazines do) instead of just saying that the toilet uses a special kind of bacteria/ fungus/ whatever - see my point. It was so badly written that I completely forgot what it had to say - and that's not my fault. I can still quote from an old Tehelka article about Karinanidhi's family or an ancient piece I read about the Mexican drug mafia using catapults to over come a billion dollar wire fence. 

3. So while I'm not blaming you for this and I understand that you are doing the best you can, I am trying to point out that Indian science journalism suffers more from boring writing and stuffing too many facts into 700 words than it does from boring topics or lack or writing. 

I know Isnerd and I've often wanted to take this up with him too, but I always meet him while he's getting tea and it's rude to interrupt. But good work guys. I'll be following the newsletter and good luck. I doubt however that you will find a large following for this due to being a curation newsletter that curates what is perceived as boring writing. But it still is something worth doing and there are people who will appreciate it for what it does and follow it too (I've signed up and am browsing your archives). 

I'd love to have a longer discussion if you guys are interested. Good luck. Are you using any software to mine the stories?  My honest opinion. There are one too many content curating websites. And given that the nature of this one is so specific, you'll never gain traction. My suggestion is to stick to writing your own articles. You'll create far more value that way. 

 Kudos. I think a good reason why science has not much represention in Indian media is because of the gene pool the journos are picked from. Most of them get out of school with an arts background and do a course in journalism staying as far away as possible from sciences.  India Today used the have the license for an Indian edition of Scientific American. Sadly, they cancelled due to lack of readership. :( Great initiative. All the best. Oh, Akshat ! A fan of your writing ! It would be fascinating to replicate to an extent the science communication efforts that happen in the *west* — which you are already a part of — in India. I would gladly volunteer (using my real persona !) toward any such effort. Warm wishes for success ! :-) Have you considered a facebook page along the lines of ""I fucking love science"" ? That seems particular suited to the format you're going for. Subscribed and thanks for doing this! Great initiative. I hope you understand the magnitude of the task ahead of you. Case in point - http://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-slideshow/seekers/philosophy/scientific-proof-that-heaven-and-hell-are-real/144860

Not only is this some mind-bogglingly awful ""journalism"", it seems there's a large market for crap like this than for really informed and mature science journalism Nice.  Really nice. Interesting stuff, I've subscribed. I'll give you feedback after I read a few stories and receive a few emails. Stay tuned.

 This is excellent! (And I'm glad you guys are publishing on Medium instead of FB and Twitter.)

I hope to see articles on interesting and original Indian research, esp. in fields like Archeology, Anthropology, Linguistics, Genetics etc. 

Back in 2007-9, a few Science-crazy Indian bloggers tried to curate blogs etc. It might be helpful to see why that model didn't work. (Or maybe it did. I am not sure.) Hmmmm interesting idea, I would like to subscribe to your newsletter. Science is there : http://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ae89087c0ccc24aed7fb0016af759e23 Ok, first of all this is a great initiative. Probably a step towards making Indian society more scitech oriented. 

But please don't refer to Quora in your newsletters. [Here's](http://www.natureasia.com/en/nindia/) an online journal that features science news pertaining to India.  Good one Akshathrathi. Please establish a corp, take insurance and a monetizing opportunity with your work which will enlighten people without bias. I like the initiative, and I see value in what you do. However, couple of questions - Why are you choosing an older delivery mechanism of newsletter/magazine, when the world is moving towards FB/Twitter/Reddit like approach to sharing news articles? Wouldn't using social networks actually help propagate science progress and ideas to wider audience? This is awesome guys. I subscribed to it and the archive proved interesting. I think Sidin's history newsletter would be of more interest to me since I am more of a history guy but I think this is great too. I am really interested in how renewable/alternate sources of energy are being researched in India -  wind power, solar power, thorium power plants - fascinating ideas, and, I think a practical method of utilizing them may arise in India where the need is dire. The chart of the week is a great feature.  OP do you need any help with this? I have an education and interest in engineering and would love to help you with this if I can Good work, /u/akshatrathi .. I like where this is going. You've already got lot of feedback here and that's a sign that your work is generating interest & discussion. So keep it up. I've subscribed to it and I like what I read. 

Here's a suggestion for your future newsletters - how about a section that chronicles the history of modern Indian science? A colleague the other day was explaining to the genesis of ISRO. He told an interesting story of how some of India's best scientists working abroad gave up their plumb jobs to come back to one of the world's poorest countries to set up a space agency. The public today enjoys TV at the remotest corners of the world thanks to these pioneers during the early 60s. ISRO in fact started operations out of a cow shed in its formative days. cut to five decades later, India's space agency is the crown jewel of low-budget satellites the world over. 

There are a lot many stories that I'm sure Indians would love to hear and seek inspiration from. Keep up the good work. Look forward to reading your newsletters. Do well, I'm sure you'll stumble into something good along the way. I did not wish to be trenchant, but somewhere out in the real world there is a 'roadies' for those who wish to be science journalism enthusiasts. And there are too many sci-journalists in India who never grow up. My intention is that serious people without any conflict-of-interest don't mock you. 
Your honeymoon with science journalism shouldn't turn into a generic 'time pass' stunt. I don't want you to decommission your project, just don't be a kind of ""Nero's guest.""   
Besides why not focus on Pakistani or Bangldaeshi or even Burmese science journalism? Don't you think there are people who need it there. Don't bog down on India. It will insulate you and you will be misled by your familiarity. 
My indignation with science journalism comes from all the corruption associated with it. You are only putting enough effort into this so that it becomes interesting conversation fodder at a party or two. Whose footsteps are you even following in? Salim Ali's? Or are there no footsteps glorious enough? Unless you go mad with science journalism you are not sacrificing enough. I mean for you to challenge yourself. You need a hatchet-job. Praise will flow from many places, just because they are stakeholders in that praise. Keep yourself sharp, not pointlessly cheered- up. I am willfully caustic, and this is an issue where you really don't need dumbed-down criticism. You need to be traumatised at the frontline and in the trenches of science journalism. You don't need to woo science journalism on a pedestal. I need to go kill a few brain cells. I started r/indiascitech sub. It would be better if you can post your articles here.

India's Mass Surveillance Capabilities,12,4y8owg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4y8owg/indias_mass_surveillance_capabilities/,16,"I read a post on r/worldnews about how Canadian police wanted to force citizens to hand over their passwords. This led me down a rabbit hole from where I eventually made my way to Wikipedia. Below is what I found. Turns out surveillance in India is far greater than in the US.

1.) CMS - The CMS gives India's security agencies and income tax officials centralized access to India's telecommunications network and the ability to listen in on and record mobile, landline and satellite calls and voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and read private emails, SMS and MMS, geolocate people using Mobile phone tracking, all in real time. It can also monitor posts on social media and Google searches, without any parliamentary or judicial oversight. There was not even any parliamentary talk before this was implemented.

2.) DRDO NETRA - NETRA can analyse voice traffic passing through software such as Skype, and intercept messages with keywords such as 'attack', 'bomb', 'blast' or 'kill' in real-time from the enormous number of tweets, status updates, emails, instant messaging transcripts, internet calls, blogs, forums and even images generated on the internet to obtain the desired intelligence.

3.) NATGRID - Each individual's data ranging from land records, internet logs, air and rail PNR, phone records, gun records, driving license, property records, insurance, and income tax records would be available in real time and with no oversight. Data from UIDAI is a part of NATGRID.

4.) LIM - LIM systems are used by the Indian Government to intercept records of voice, SMSs, GPRS data, details of a subscriber's application and recharge history and call detail record (CDR) and monitor Internet traffic, emails, web-browsing, Skype and any other Internet activity of Indian users. Mobile operators deploy their own LIM system which allows the government to intercept calls. These surveillance systems are under complete control of the government, and their functioning is secretive and unknown to the ISPs.

5.) UIDAI - Collects the biometric (2 iris scans, all 10 fingerprints) and demographic data of residents, store them in a centralized database, and issue a 12-digit unique identity number called Aadhaar to each resident. 

In 2013, the CBI was trying to solve the case of a rape of a schoolgirl. It approached a Goa local court saying that they had acquired some fingerprints from the scene and they could be matched with the UIDAI database. The court asked UIDAI to hand over all data of all persons in Goa to CBI. The Central Forensic Science Laboratory stated that they would have several 100,000 false positives from the 60 million Goa residents. The Supreme Court restrained the central government and the UIDAI from sharing data with any third party or agency, whether government or private, without the consent of the Aadhaar-holder in writing. However Aadhaar information is accessible under the CMS, NETRA, NATGRID and LIM.

6.) Encryption beyond 40 bits is illegal. Banks are exempt from this and can utilize 256 bit encryption. There may be plans to increase encryption allowed to 128 bits. Whatsapp was nearly banned due to the end to end encryption. In the end, there were no laws set in place for Over The Top services.

7.) BOUNDLESSINFORMANT - India is among the countries subjected to extreme NSA surveillance, more than Afghanistan, China, Russia and US. 

8.) ITA-2000 - The Indian parliament passed the Information Technology Act of 2008 with no debate, giving the government fiat power to tap all communications without a court order or a warrant.

Section 69 empowers the Central Government/State Government/ its authorized agency to intercept, monitor or decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource. Failure to comply by can result in 7 year imprisonment.

Section 66A has been used to arrest cartoonists depicting corruption, people sharing cartoons depicting politicans via email, tweeting about corruption and nepotism, positing and liking the said post on Facebook insulting politicians.

A.) In 2010, a cartoonist was arrested under Section 66A and for sedition. His cartoons depicting widespread corruption in India were considered offensive. 

B.) In 2012, a professor was arrested for sharing a cartoon of a Chief Minister and the Railway Minister. The email was sent from the email address of a housing society. The secretary of the housing society, was also arrested. They were charged under Section 66A, for defamation, for obscene gesture to a woman, and abetting a crime. 

C.) In 2012, a businessman was arrested under Section 66A. He had sent tweet accusing the son of the Finance Minister of corruption. 

D.) In 2012, a 21-year-old girl was arrested for posting a message on Facebook criticizing the shutdown in Mumbai for the funeral of politician. Another 20-year-old girl was arrested for ""liking"" the post. They were charged hurting religious sentiments, under Section 66A, and promoting enmity between classes. 

E.) In 2015, a teenage boy was arrested for making a post on Facebook insulting a politician. He was charged under Section 66A, for promoting enmity between different religions, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, and public mischief.

Our RA&W (CIA equivalent) answers only to the PM and not the public. During its inception its powers and reach were compared to the KGB. According to Reporters Without Borders, India's C-DoT, along with NSA and GCHQ, hacked into the very heart of the internet and turned a collective resource into a weapon in the service of special interests that flout the freedom of information, freedom of expression and the right to privacy.

Due to the widespread corruption, any powerful person can gain access to and manipulate all your data. Court cases get dragged on for decades. I have zero belief that these agencies can keep all this data secure. If someone powerful decides to target me, there is nothing I can do.

Last Week in Parliament (July 18 to July 22),46,4uhxod,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4uhxod/last_week_in_parliament_july_18_to_july_22/,8,"Hello /r/India,

I return with another four weeks of fun and frolic at the expense of our elected leaders in Parliament!

Last week, a shiny new cabinet was sworn in, a spirited discussion on Kashmir crisis (and TN Fishermen and Bangladeshi infiltrators) happened, an unknown rule was invoked unknowingly and shot down promptly and many legislations were passed.
Let’s get right into it!

___
#Shiny new Cabinet sworn in
___

Apart from the [53 new members](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/partymemberlist.aspx) that were sworn into Rajya Sabha, PM Modi introduced his new ministers to both houses. Prakash Javadekar replaced Smriti Irani as Minister of Human Resource Development, Vijay Goyal was given Ministry of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs & Sports and Anil Madhav Dave was sworn in as the new Minister of State (Independent charge) of Environment forest and Climate Change. A whole host of new Ministers of State were also sworn in. 

I know what you’re thinking.
 
*What’s the difference between a Cabinet Minister, Minister of State (Independent Charge) and Minister of State?* 

**Cabinet Minister**: Person is given full control over a Ministry and is eligible to attend cabinet meetings (which is the highest decision-making body of the country).

**Minister of State (Independent Charge)**: Person is given charge over a ministry, but the PMO keeps a close watch on how the ministry is functioning. These ministers are allowed to attend cabinet meetings only if the PM’s permits them to do so.

**Minister of State**: Person is given charge of a specific department or just a part of a Ministry, especially when the Ministry is large (Eg: Home, Defence or Finance). The Cabinet Minister has complete authority to decide what tasks are to be given to the MoS within the Ministry. MoS cannot attend cabinet meetings.

Casual Observation: Out of all those who were sworn in, Arjun Ram Meghwal seemed to have gotten the loudest thumps and cheers. He used to be the Chief Whip of BJP in Lok Sabha and has now been made MoS of Finance. 
Seems like he won’t be able to [bicycle to Parliament anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxyz8YASYHk).

Bonus: Here’s the [mother of all government directories](http://goidirectory.nic.in/union_categories.php?ct=E002), in case you want to find out how to reach ministries. This includes state ministries and PSUs as well. Explore away!

#Kashmir Crisis… Bangladeshi Infiltration and Tamil Fishermen
___
Discussions were held in both houses of Parliament regarding the ongoing agitation happening in the Kashmir Valley. While accusations flew thick between the Congress and BJP, regional parties like AIADMK and TMC decided to bring in their own international border issues into the discussion.

Kalyan Banerjee from TMC started speaking about infiltration from Bangladesh to West Bengal when he was interrupted by Ananth Kumar, Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers. He pointed out the Mr Banerjee was going off topic. 

[Then this happened](http://imgur.com/lWsluww)

You're killin it Khargeji!

AIADMK’s A Anwar Raajhaa (With the kind blessings of [Puruchithalaiva Amma](http://mythicalindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/weird_jayalalitha_fans.jpg)) spoke about Kashmir and then switched to talk about the problem of fishermen in Tamil Nadu who are being harassed by the Sri Lankan Navy. Raanjhaa demanded that this should be declared as a national issue as well.

#Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha Adjourns
___
The Parliament was summoned on July 18 for the monsoon session and the news was splattered with headlines like “Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha adjourns”. 

Everyone was like, “What?! Why do these politicians keep disrupting the house? Why don’t these people want to work?” 

Well, they do, but they couldn’t help it this time round.

The adjournment wasn’t because of disruptions, which is usually the cause, but for paying respects to a sitting member of Parliament who passed away. Mr Dalpat Singh Parasate of Shahdol constituency in Madhya Pradesh passed away on June 1 (#RIP). 

It’s a followed practice that in case of the death of a sitting member, Parliament will not transact any business on the first day of sitting as a mark of respect. In case an MP dies while the Parliament is in session, the house is adjourned for the following day. In the Budget session, Mr PA Sangma passed away and a similar adjournment followed. His son Conrad Sangma now occupies his seat of Tura (Meghalaya). 

The first order of business for this session in Lok Sabha was [his swearing in](http://imgur.com/vgFFwdH).

Interestingly enough, Rajya Sabha has decided in May 2016 to [curtail this practice](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-not-to-adjourn-for-day-if-sitting-member-dies-in-intersession-period/article8672837.ece) if the Member of Parliament passes in the interim period. The upper house will now only adjourn if an MP dies during sessions. Lok Sabha sticks to its ol’ ways. 

___
#Thou Shalt not read out Speeches
___

While giving his speech on the Kashmir crisis, A Anwar Raajhaa of the AIADMK happened to just read it out from a few sheets of paper. He even mixed up the sheets in the middle and went off course a few times. 

Rao Indrajit Singh, MoS of Urban Development, took strong offence and got up to object. He asked the chair to stop him because there is a rule against reading out speeches in the Parliament. Well, he goofed up a little though. The person in the chair was Deputy Speaker Dr M Thambidurai. He’s from the AIADMK.

Thambidurai seemed visibly upset that the chair was being questioned and asked Singh to sit down. Although a lot of the conversation was not put on record, witnesses of LSTV will vouch about the use of the word “he’s speaking nonsense” being thrown around rather loudly. At one point, Mr Singh seemed to have given out the impression to the Deputy Speaker that he was being partial towards his own party member. The otherwise calm and gentle Thambidurai seemed to be visibly upset. 

The funny thing is that this is actually a rule. Rule 352 of the [Procedure and Conduct of Business](http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rules.html) says: 

> “A member while speaking shall not…. (xi) read a written speech except with the previous permission of the Chair.” 

So in this case, there was no clarity whether or not the prior permission of the chair was taken. If only Mr Rao Indrajit Singh quoted the rule number, he might have been able to achieve his objective. 

Mods, pliss to tweet the correct rule to him?

#A few other interesting rules (for teh lulz)

(iii) shall bow to the Chair while entering or leaving the House, and also when taking or leaving his seat 

[We’re not worthy!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/not-worthy.gif)

Personally, I find this unacceptable. The parliament functions for the people and it should continue functioning beyond who lives or dies. One can have a couple of minutes to mark respect but adjournment of parliament is just loss of time and completely disrespectful to the people of India. [deleted] Thanks again man. This was brilliant work OP! Take an upvote !! When will MPs stop shouting and start discussing? On Friday treasury bench disturbed Rajya sabha on the issue of Panjab's AAP's Mann.

"r/india, ever wonder why hinduism hasn't clashed with modern science the way we see christianity does",50,1uyroo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1uyroo/rindia_ever_wonder_why_hinduism_hasnt_clashed/,116,"I've always thought that as religious as my parents are, they've never forced me to believe that brahma created the universe and evolution is bullshit. As far as I know, nobody's done this. Science and technology always holds a space parallel to religion and as much as they provide alternate interpretations to different things, I've never seen them clash. On the other hand, you hear on r/atheism about all the clashes that christianity has with modern science. You have main stream news organizations in the US that support them. Am I wrong in thinking this? what are your thoughts?",Hoping_The_Unhopable," We also have ""mainstream news organizations"" in India that regularly broadcast astrology, vaastu, numerology and such. In fact, I'd say that sort of stuff is even more prevalent in modern India than in the US. It's not presented as a clash, partly because in India, that sort of conflict wouldn't necessarily sell more ads. In India we tend to maintain those contradictions quite easily - you see science professors who hold all sorts of crazy superstitions - kundli, birthstones, etc.

Also, I wouldn't consider /r/atheism as a good source of truth about the US in any way, shape or form. While a lot of Americans are religious, the truly crazy views are a lot more fringe than you may think, even in the southern states. It used to be that Hinduism was much more open to change, but I feel it is changing for the worse. 

These are some of the things that are bugging me:

* The rise in babas and godmen. Every street has its own godmen and with people having disposable income.. they are giving huge sums of money to these godmen. 

* Perpetuating Victorian era morals in the name of tradition. Shiv sena and Bhajrang dal are among the worst offenders when it comes to this, they act as if they have a moral authority on the populace. It cannot be denied that Hinduism is morphed into something that is not, but all those hindutva vadis claim that there is a ""true"" form of hinduism.
* Too much reliance on alternative medicine even in urban areas. 
* The festivals have become a pissing contest among different groups. The worst example is Ganesh Chaturdi. Hinduism is about worshiping nature.. all our major festivals revolve around the farming season, but not we are pretty disconnected to why we celebrate the festivals. We associate mythology to the festivals while ignoring nature.   
* The superstitions are getting ridiculous and the laws of the land don't help at all. Speak against superstitions and get ready to face charges of offending the sentiments of a group.  

> As far as I know, nobody's done this. Science and technology always holds a space parallel to religion and as much as they provide alternate interpretations to different things, I've never seen them clash. 

I don't know about you, but I see very few rational Indians and I hangout with Ph.D's on a daily basis. We are good at compartmentalizing stuff. I mean we all start compartmentalizing stuff from an early age. We learn about traffic rules in school and the moment we step out of the building we see everyone breaking them. The only place zebra crossings make complete sense are in schools. We also learn about corruption, adulteration, equality, child labor, etc. but see none of it being practiced anywhere. We have been conditioned to learn that everything we learn in school belongs in school itself and does not apply to the world we are living in(sometimes that is a good thing but not always).    Hinduism is a encyclopedia of contradictory/complementary beliefs, it has little or no ""commandments"", it merely has suggestions.

Thus, whether you are a believer in ONE god, or a polytheist, or a deist, or an atheist - you would find resonance in hindu texts/traditions.

Abrahamic religions on the other hand, claim to have the **ONLY TRUE** path & also encourage believers to *help* non-believers find the true path.  [deleted] I think hinduism is open to the possibilities that there's more than one path to the truth. Also, there's a built-in respect for scholars and text that doesn't exist in the Abrahamic religions.  We may have appropriated some of the superficial trappings of science, but have not really imbibed the core values of rational enquiry. The West went through an [age of enlightenment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment) - we're yet to go through it or anything similar. Add to this a heady dose of culture bhakti, and you can see why people don't bother to question religion too much in our country. 

A similar problem exists in Islamic countries too, but they go one step further and formally BAN any questioning of dogmas. We are free to question, but we don't. Lucky you.

On the other hand many years ago rivers of milk were poured down murtis because they were found to be ""drinking"".

Plus /r/atheism was where well meaning atheist gathered, and then it became a place where people exchange and feed off of horror stories. It became a horror story collector. [deleted] India is the place of birth to one of the oldest Atheistic philosophies (depending on which definition of Atheism that you accept). Please read about Samkhya Philosophy. The modern day Hinduism is a mixture of both astika and nastika philosophies. People would be  more happy to accept the science and try to find some similarity in Hindu texts than saying science is bullshit. 
I am not sure if you ever heard of the parallel to evolution that some staunch Hindu philosophers give. They say that Hindu texts have shown evolution indirectly through various incarnations of Vishnu. As per the evolution the life started in water, the life forms grew complex moved to shallow waters, then crawled to dry areas, started walking and then after lot of steps came the intelligent life. Now look at the various incarnations of Vishnu in chronological order Matsya (Fish), Kurma (Tortoise), Varaha (Boar), Narasimha (half man/half lion), Vamana (dwarf), parasurama (living in jungle), and Rama. I am an atheist, but I was blown away by the parallel they drew to evolution  when I first heard this :) saturday vellapanti ki hadd ho gayi. Probably has something to do with Hinduism having scholars in past who were busy trying to explain the universe (do notice when muslims first invaded they spent time destroying Hindu universities and books.. and stealing knowledge which they took back to middleshit).

Anyways, Hinduism was more open in the past but now it has been influenced by Christianity and Islam over the centuries.  I just think the status of hinduism os not under as much threat as christianity. When cornered, the right wing will be a lot more prominant.  I don't know the exact answer to why Hinduism never clashes with modern science, I would have to ask Narendra Dhabolkar. Oh wait, I can't. Do you know why? Same reason RSS fails to convert the Hindus into a single voting block - Hinduism is not a religion - it's just a collection of trade collectives, family castes and cults.  I think pure, unadulterated Hinduism is the most ~~scientific~~ logical doctrine there is. I'd love to discuss this, but if you say ""five crore gods"", I'll come down there and beat you up like no tomorrow. > they've never forced me to believe that brahma created the universe

Where does it say that Brahma created the whole universe? I'd love to know what the Muslims are told about evolution etc. Are they told that the Quran is the only Wikipedia they'd ever need? Probably because it has a much looser set of beliefs. It's been evolving continuously over thousands of years and isn't tied to any particular holy book or set of teachings and rituals. Indian Culture the best.
Hinduism the greatest.
NaMo, our PM. Another thing is that our relegion is part myth and part legend and part science. 

As an example comets,  planets are all gods..  That is myth and science entwined. 

The vedas were very accurate to state the length of a day and a solar year.  There is an excerpt from Arthur C Clarke finding the accuracy,  that too only among our civilisation,  fascinating. Would have linked it,  using a mobile.  The reason Hinduism isn't threatened by 'evolution theory' is because some of the Hindu Gods are monkeys. Hence there is no problem in saying that people evolved from monkeys.

What I am trying to understand is why do people believe in it. I am hoping I will come across some interesting points of views. 

Astrology is not just any superstition, it is well crafted mumbo jumbo. Whenever it is right people will remember it for rest of their life. Whenever it is wrong people somehow don't want remember it or blame it on miscalculation or grey area. 

In this age of science and technology I am astonished how many of my young friends blindly following it and advocating for it.

Is it because of insecurity or is it a need to feel big by correlating one self with other bigger things in the universe or ... what is it ?",gggg_," People don't want to take responsibility for their actions. They need to blame something if it all goes wrong.  Humans are insecure creatures.  A lot of people all over the world believe in a lot of random things. This could be astrology, palmistry, religious mumbo jumbo, scientology, etc. etc. And what people believe in changes based on what part of the world you are in. 

The reasons are the same: 
1. Mankind has an innate desire to look for answers to questions that are pretty profound. And the best way to look for these answers is through the rigor and precision that science can give. But on the other hand, vast majority of the people are not well versed with the scientific method, or are simply too busy/lazy/overwhelmed to partake in the scientific method. 

2. At the same time, these ""spirituality"" peddling gurus/astrologers/etc. very conveniently package their wares using science-y sounding words, and that is sufficient for people to start believing that they know what they are saying. Considering that the scientific community in general is not very vocal against this, the common man has easy access to mumbo jumbo compared to real science. 

3. Now, add to this the fact that these people look to answer these profound questions that I mentioned earlier, and coupled with the fact that man feels uneasy without knowing these answers, pseudo science and religion in general gives you the ""way out"". It assuages a lot of people and it lets them believe (wrongly) that somehow things are under control and they will work out well if they do things a certain way. 

Coming to why indians believe in astrology a lot:

1. India in general is highly superstitious. Our education system does nothing to promote scientific temper, and so you have a large population with degrees (or without) who will lap up anything and is very gullible.

2. There is a general feeling (even among educated indians) that science is somehow a ""western"" thing, and is a means to discredit our glorious past etc. A lot of people I know want to somehow go back to this ""ancient knowledge"" that we had, and astrology being one of them has a lot of backers. Whenever I try telling someone that it's bogus, I am met with ""oh you only believe what westerners say"" :-/

3. Confirmation bias. People conveniently ignore all the times an astrologer was wrong, and remember the times he was right, and that lends credibility to his claims. Add to the fact that it's such a ""cultural"" thing now (consult astrologer for marriage/buying a house/travel... ) and you have a massive swathe of indians blindly believing in it, and not even trying to question it.  It's placebo effect.

http://sciencequestionswithchris.wordpress.com/2013/03/23/how-does-astrology-work/ [deleted] I don't think most sane people follow it dogmatically. When your life is bleak the hope of good thing happening in the future is great thing to hold on to. 

It also has to do with our risk averse nature. Its like, if by chance it is right, better to be conformannt now so as to start on the best possible footing.

Most people a very pragmatic and if astrology actually becomes a problem most ignore it. because it provides comfort? the way i see it, those astrology columns have feel good stuff in it.

Watch this, a nice video about superstitions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlMiKrwCRQ0

Search of 'Enemies of reason' for longer version. Covers ghost-talkers, astrology, and homeopathy. Other than what has already been mentioned (insecurity, assigning blame/responsibility), there's the issue of superstition in general being a product of childhood indoctrination. This is actually true for a lot of things.

And there's the issue of peer pressure. If everyone around you is talking about astrology, star signs and visiting gurujis that offer bullshit predictions, a lot of people ""give in"" to peer pressure and start doing it. It's not really any weirder than other supernatural beliefs. I've even met some atheists who believe in astrology. I do think dark matter has predictive power. It may or may not be real, but at least it's a theory. As you get lower and lower level models (thanks to reductions) what do you get at the very lowest level? The big bang? The context is your experience, raised to the power of communicated predictive models. If you don't believe that you believe, you believe that you don't believe, which is even worse than just admitting you believe because you are deluded doubly. This denial of belief is operative in not only the pragmatic scientism of liberals (every ideology appeals to the 'facts') but also the violent religious fundamentalists.

Fundamentalism is actually a similar story. They don't believe they believe, they just know that their religion is correct or rather that it is pragmatically useful.  I do not belive in it but my realtives and friends do. They all are more succesful than me. They are now asking me to start following some "" babaji""


What to do ?? Its all good till it reaches a point where it overtakes your life and everything you do or want to do needs a astrology seal of approval. Take it with a pinch of salt rather than taking it so seriously that you cant take a decision on your own. This is what i believe in.  My one of friend believes in it for confidence. His talks with astrologers when he is at worst of his life ( nobody to motivate - friends or family) those anonymous men help him regain confidence by telling him he can do it! [deleted] I know I may get hate here... but this one astrologer that we had, he actually knew his shit. 

Background story : Okay, let me give an example of just two of this SuperAstrologer's multiple instances of good advice to our family.  

1) My grandfather (mother's side) was once about to buy a plot of land by putting in his life savings. Everything looked good. My grandmother decided to just consult this astrologer guy. The astrologer strongly advised against it. We took his advice and did not buy that piece of land. Turns out the prospective seller got implicated in a fraud case just 2 months later involving that land. The land was not his to  begin with. 

2) My aunt (mother's sister) had a pretty lazy husband who lived off whatever his rich family  would dole out. So we all pulled some high-level connections in Dubai and got him a proper honourable job there. We thought he had adjusted very well there. So, we go to see this astrologer on some other consultation, and we casually mention this guy who's working abroad. 
   The astrologer does his thing with cowries on the wooden board, and says ""The guy is in India. He has come back"" Now none of us had been told this, the guy's wife was with us. So, obviously none of us could believe it. 
    Next day, we get a call. Without informing anybody, he had gotten himself fired from his Dubai job and was loitering around in Mumbai. 

There are many such other predictions that have been 100% accurate by this guy. My mom swears by him. And honestly, I do too.  I think its not just Indians believe in Astrology, Chinese and [westerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_astrology) do  Guys,

Have any of you heard about Sharad Upadhye? He has a marathi show which is pretty humorous. However, whatever he has said about my rashi is true. I have been agnostic my whole life but this dude is right on the money.

He has his whole series. Here's one of his videos:

I would love to know what you guys think about him.... Because having a gazillion gods is not enough, so we gotta involve planets and their alignments; to make our sorry lives even more miserable. Man curiosity to find logic and reason behind everything leads to believe in astrology or superstition. He don't want to know that some events are not in his control that's why he do all sort of superstitious things to take control of the event. I think when something goes wrong unreasonably man want to know why it went wrong and it stands the same for if something happen good unreasonably.  People believe in such stuff because it promises you knowledge of the unknown. Not knowing something makes them fearful. It's human nature to be lazy (inertia). So when something doesn't go according to your plan, just find an easy way out and blame it on the ""stars""!

Also astrology/astrologers target weak minded people. They are very easy to manipulate and convince or coerce into something. So there is a big population in India, who are easy targets. This cycle is a self feeding one! This is a country with thousands of years of superstition. Only education and scientific temperament will help. False sense of preparedness. beacause someone else said so, egyptians belived in Ra and fox headed humans why , because someone told them as simple as that..

I dare you, pay 5 rupee to hundred people and make them send a message
ganjutappa maa will bless you or something like that...bang I will not be surprised if Ganjutappa maa temples sprout up in all cities by a year. [deleted] maybe it has a placebo effect?

maybe because their parents believed it, they do too?

Kundli's seem to be more accurate if you know the exact time of your birth. Maybe you should give it a shot? [deleted] There will be incidents in life which are devastating, in all manners. Phases, when people feel helpless. Astrology is one quicker, easier solution to give confidence for such helpless states. It is psychiatry, it gives the person who believes in it, the confidence that things may get better now. And anyone can imagine how positive such an influence can be. 

So, I do not try to find colutions in astrology, but I do not discourage others too. It may be mumbo jumbo, but it has its impacts - directly or indirectly.",Science/Technology,2014-08-06 12:47:17
