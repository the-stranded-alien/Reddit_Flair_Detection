PV Sindhu becomes the first Indian to be Badminton World Champion!,3423,cv80o4,https://i.imgur.com/aWXGxzz.jpg,101,,phantom_97," An excerpt from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu#Early_life_and_training):

>She eventually started playing badminton from the age of eight. Sindhu first learned the basics of the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy. While profiling Sindhu's career, a correspondent with *The Hindu* wrote:  
>  
>*""The fact that she reports on time at the coaching camps daily, travelling a distance of 56 km from her residence, is perhaps a reflection of her willingness to complete her desire to be a good badminton player with the required hard work and commitment.""*

Proud of her, she deserves it ‚ù§Ô∏è Yesss,This is huge considering she had lost in her previous two final appearances.
  
This is also a ruthless revenge for her narrow loss in the final against Okuhara in 2017 since she beat her in only 38 minutes! bless you, Sindhu. Wonderful effort by Sindhu! Hats off to Pullela Gopichand as well! Awesome she absolutely dominated Okuhara. 21-7 21-7 wow  thumping victory

Edit: (7:00PM) You can still watch the match on hotstar. starts at 2:23:00 mark 

https://www.hotstar.com/sports/badminton/final-okuhara-vs-sindhu/1440001984 Also B. Sai Praneeth won the Bronze medal in Men's singles category. Two medals in a single tournament. Thank you for making India proud Sindhu! She's a true national treasure This was one of the most one sided final I have ever seen. *Akshay Kumar has entered the chat* Amazing. Really proud of her This was sheer perseverance that finally paid off. Congratulations and this has to be one of the proudest moments of not only her life, but Indian sports as a whole. Not to forget, she dedicated this medal to her mother. It was her birthday today. Best gift ever. Congratulations!

As per the buzz Akshay is going to make movie out of this. He will act as Gopichand. Yay !! Sindhu üòç Congratulations, golden girl. Truly dominant on court. Hope this erases the idea that she always falls one short from people's minds. Goodminton 21-7, 21-7

That's pure dominance! 

This one medal was evading her for so long, In 2013, 2014 she won Bronze, 2017, 2018 she won Silver but 2019 she made sure to clinch nothing but Gold...Brilliant and resilient stuff! üëè [deleted] Her Quarterfinal round with Tai Tzu Ying was a hard fought win, she lost the first round, but went on to beat her in the next 2 to move to Semis. The last 2 sets were pretty close scores too.

Compared to that she had fun at Semis and Finals. Kudos to the World Champion

Quite surprised by the one sided score line against Okuhara. P V Sindhu <3 <3 She is gonna inspire a whole new generation, for sure. So proud of her.... to lose two finals but then win her third final and that too in such emphatic fashion. No words can describe her achievement. Champüôå Really a proud moment for the nation. This needs more coverage. Girl power in India ! Heartiest congratulations to this strong and magnificent lady! She's doing us real proud! Proud feeling for her üëç Did Carolina Marin play? Congratulations to p v sindhu for making india proud . Congratulations Sindhu. 

Has Kangana or Akshay announced a movie already? Aye haye. Boht khush kita. Sohni kudi. Set 1 = 21-7

Set 2 = 21-7
.
P1V1=P2V2 ? Tight slap on the face of people who called her a chocker!! Modi üòé hai ü§ô toh üëê mumkin hai üëå.

Edit: /s -_- Cricketers can go suck a.... Not sure why we guys are so good at individual sports but terrible at team sports. And before you come at me, Cricket (a game) can't be counted as a team sport.

Congrats to Sindhu nevertheless.

EDIT: Thanks for the downboats. Forgot I was in /r/india. You guys can defend it all you like, only 12(?) fucking Commonwealth countries play the 'sport'. Last I heard, there was a commonwealth island where the WC (yes, world cup) players were carpenters...lol #THIS IS AN AD Easier to win over okhuhara at world championship than beating her at Olympics .",Sports,2019-08-25 20:41:16
India‚Äôs Sumit Nagal took down Roger Federer 6-4 in the first set!! Yay!!,2094,cvxqea,https://i.redd.it/yp1w5yi7ewi31.jpg,95,,babloopachisya," 1-1 after two sets but really happy to see an Indian playing singles in the main draw. I remember the French open match between Somdev Devvarman and Nadal 7-8 years ago.

The first two sets were really close but Nadal just upped his game and sailed through.

Damn, what happened to that guy. He showed a lot of promise. It‚Äôs an amazing performance by the young man. Showed a lot of heart. Surpassed my expectations.
Let‚Äôs see if he can keep it up over multiple sets. Move over Nadal, Nagal is the new kid in town! 

All aboard the Nagal hype train, choo choo! This is like teleporting to the final stage boss right after you start the game and actually winning with your shitty blaster He tried his best. Really proud He just lost How do we add a picture of him there ? Next 2 sets Federer has turned it on. Still much more than expected. He gave a good fight, but Federer just proved why he is liked the world over. His first ever set in the US Open and he bested Federer dayum. Hoping he would win the match was wishful thinking imo but this in itself is a great achievement and I hope he continues to grow. damn, Federer really showed him why he's the greatest. Props to Nagal for downing him one set out of four, though! Second set not looking good so far :( Google doesn't even have his pic Is there a live stream? Where can I watch this? Roger Federer won in the end. But Sumit Nagal showed if players like him are given more opportunities they can really defeat the biggest players in the town. Some good shots by the lad. A lot of credit goes to Virat Kohli... 

Confused? 

Virat Kohli Foundation has been helping and inspiring the youth of our country to follow their passion and dreams. They facilitate in providing the much needed help in preparing people like Sumit to scale at tremendous heights.., First Sindhu then this guy. 4-6,6-1,6-2,6-4 final score fyi Sorry, this feels like Ironman versus Thanos.

Can half imagine Fed say in Swiss accent, ""All this for a drop of blood....""

Well played buddy! The guy has the talent, great winner there! Nangal Dam!!!! Headbutting the  Grandmaster himself. Big deal. 

Great Job Sumit Nagal Damn federer is getting his ass kicked left and right last year and this year I wish more people knew about how big a thing this is. There is always a Indian better thn you. Really amazing Performance,feel proud as an Indian. Madlad I am excited that an Indian just 22 years old is showing so much potential but it would have been more glorious if his coaching would have been in India. only nadal or djokovic can match fedrrer Great performance !  The P.V Sindhu Factor Is Strong Lol Does anyone in India care about table tennis anyway? Really proud of sumit!! I wish him all the best! Super Sumit Nagal or Sumit Nadal?????? :))) Holy crap, this is big. Excellent! This is amazing stuff. Way to go Nagal, damn proud you. Ye toh bas shuruvaat hai, keep up good job! It's true though.  We have the most people in the world that deficate outside and on the beaches.  We need to stop doing this.  The internet has brought it to the world.  Im in Bogot√° Colombia and was hitting on a girl and we met like six times then one day in front of all my new friends she pulls some bs up on the computer and shows a YouTube video of us shitting on railroad tracks... Like 100 people walking out of their homes to poo.  Everyone laughed at me so I just left Wow, nice going Sumit! shit I'm watching this now! Kid's got heart! Holy shit balls! hum indians choti choti baaton mein khushiyan dhuoond hi lete hain. Supported by VK! A young guy struggling to keep up against a guy almost twice his age.

&#x200B;

indians, celebrating mediocrity as always. All the big matches are fixed, they wanted to give some spotlight to an Indian so they let him win one set, but that's all they'll give. Oh great... Now parents are going to spend money on their kids tennis lessons instead of teaching them how to not public deficate.

The incomplete end of an era.,1425,cc7zis,https://i.redd.it/yduuz9txxt931.jpg,118,,rgaywala," Credits : Krishna Rathi

Original Post can be found on his Instagram handle : rathikrishna42 Is it really an incomplete end of the era? The man literally won everything there is to win in the game as captain, not even as just a player.

&#x200B;

Edit: A word Why do we expect the world from someone? He has achieved so so much but everyone will always talk about how in his last performance he didn‚Äôt do this or that. Sachin has to go through the same. Stop focusing on one thing and look at how far he has come in his career. Indians are just never happy, it‚Äôs sad. They do the same with their kids. At least give a credit who made this. Why did you crop his name. Downvoting as OP cropped out original creator 's name.. that's theft. Why do you have to keep reminding us :( Sigh..Does not matter how cool you are.. This will probably haunt him for years. I cannot imagine the plethora of emotions that would have been going through him since the start of that over. But, a big salute to one of the best captains and readers of the game, India has ever had. An incomplete picture at first because you cropped the artist name. Give credit where it‚Äôs due. This is quite unfair. He'll be remembered as a legend despite his last performance Lol, stop putting people on pedestals. Not incomplete and no end either. 

As a batsman he has slowed down in terms of power hitting but Pandya/ Pant will take over that front (which they should have in the semifinals). He is still as good a batsman you'll get for No 4/ 5, still a fast runner and lighting quick behind the wicket. Like for Federer it's the outsiders who are waiting for the retirement non-stop.

It is Ravi Shastri we need to bid goodbye to and move on. Some people move on Am I the only one who read 'DHOR' üôÜ No its not incomplete. He gave us Worldcup, worldcup 20 20, champion trophies, he is the most successful Indian criket captain in History. He is complete, his era is complete. He will deserve farewell like Sachin whenever he want to retire Its not the end. He will still play in T20 WC. Sorry I read it as Dhor first r/DesignPorn Incomplete? Bro which world are you living in? Or do you have amnesia. He has won everything that had to be won in cricket. Only captain with T20 World Cup, 50 Over World Cup & Champions Trophy. Pardon my language but fuck you for your stupid creative. It's because of ungrateful people who call themselves fans just like you that these cricketers are put under so much pressure to always perform. What have you done in your own uneventful life? Have you ever thought about that? Have you ever completed anything worthy for generations to come? You bro, are shit. There's little or no worth to your existence. I am no Dhoni fanboy but your creative is just dumb, tone deaf and utterly mistaken. Thoda jyada ho gaya [deleted] Wonderful creativity. *an era How you say incomplete Bar bar yaad mat dilao yr. Seriously guys there is no fairy tale ending in life. He got out doing what he did best and that is all that matters. People want everything to be a bollywood movie. I don't think that Dhoni has to rely on some armchair critic telling him how his career was incomplete. He has achieved a lot already. I have myself not been a huge fan of keeping him in the team for the past 6 months, but you have to be foolish to think his career is incomplete. Dhoni is not retiring.

He's not. Okay!? Out of the loop here. Can anyone tell me what exactly happened?

I didnt watch the world cup that's why. Thats how Karma bites you... [deleted] Why tf is everyone saying end of an era? He hasn't even slightly hinted at retiring anytime soon. Is this the doing of his haters? It‚Äôs not the end. He s gonna hang around No worries, he will be there (next worldcup) HOPE [deleted]",Sports,2019-07-12 16:03:48

Netflix - Expensive 


Amazon is good as well. Courtesy IPL, World Cup etc TIL Star India is owned by Disney!!!

Disney simultaneuously makes Avengers and Kyu ki Saas bhi kabhi bahu thi. Was hotstar not always the number one, as it has free content as well as sports ? Hotstar still doesn't support surround sound. If only their app was better Hotstar had first launch advantage + they have sport streaming right + lot of free content + good premium too + cheap as compared too others. Maybe because Netflix has jack shit local content. Did they make a single original series in Telugu? Amazon did make at least one. Amazon and HotStar has way way more local movies too. INR 365 for sports streaming (and premium Indian content). Don't think there is any other service with a similar value for money. I can watch premium hotstar for free.

I cannot splurge on 10-12k stuff and my budget is limited to 3-4k.",theloopsoup," Just any wireless. Sound quality doesnt matter much, because you need to be concentrating on the run. Personally , I use the Skullcandy riff sp5xw- l672  wireless headphones , on Amazon for around  4700 bucks ..great for Running , extremely comfortable and good sound  output as well Jaybird X3, Sweat proof and connect with Apple watch (which comes with 5gb space to sync and store music). > I cannot splurge 

&#x200B;

>my budget is limited to 3-4k 

&#x200B;

And here I am using Rs 399 wired earphones from Amazon. Sigh. Just search for sports Bluetooth earphones there are a lot of devices out there 

Basically you need to buy something that is waterproof ( so sweat doesn't affect it) and has a great fit so that it doesn't keep coming off when you run 

And sports earphones are designed with those in mind you can find a descent one for around 1500-2500 I bought these cheap $20 wireless earbuds from Aliexpress. They sound decent and won't come off while running.

https://m.aliexpress.com/item/32985227564.html?trace=wwwdetail2mobilesitedetail&spm=a2g0n.ams_82754.m0ae6a8.4.67a04a9bLJRJkP Airpods Boult Bluetooth Try ""tagg inferno"". They have good audio quality and decent battery life. One downside is that they get little uncomfortable if you use them while laying in the bed. But they are perfect for workout activities. If your limit is 3k-4k.
You can go for Huawei Freelace. Not available in India; get it on AliExpress. Jaybird x4, nothing else comes close. Boat is something that i am proud of... within 3k you get good sound and great quality Some ‚Çπ1.5k cheapass from Amazon

Works fine. Wireless JBL by harman Buy a cheaper one, most of the in earphones get spoilt due to sweat, dirt and wax One Plus bullet earphones Boat rockerz 225 Try out the Artis earphones! Pixel earphones. All other earphones have a tendency to fall off. Go for true wireless ones.. lots of options under 4k... Mivi crossbeats , leaf, nurepublic

Just make sure your expectation is right. These dont have large batteries.. i use jlabs which i picked up from an overseas trip.. had the noise shots before.. the battry lasted 3 hrs..

So if ur running for longer or training for a full.. i would suggest spend some more and get a good battery life ones.. Galaxy buds. Mi airdots are down to 1K on aliexpress. Doubt you will find better TWS option the price range. Sony MDRXB510AS wired or jbl endurance run bt for wireless. Park me kaise sound quality bhai. Jo bhi earphones mile Vohi sahi hain My friend uses a boult tru5 and I've heard they're generally good Qcy qs1/t1c CX -180, best under 1000 For running purpose buy 500 600 rs waha things.

I mean howdo you high tarriffs on Tesla and other Electric Vehicles with the lofty claims made by ministers ? Yahan road hai nahi.... RumTum Tesla ki baat kar raberahe ho Do we even have the infrastructure to support electric cars? It's not just import duties. I drive a Tesla. This car won't survive in Indian conditions without heavy modifications. The clearance is too low, the materials and paint too susceptible to the constant battering Indian roads provide, etc.

The core issue remain that they're expensive and this will be just another luxury vehicle that won't sell because the country simply doesn't have the infrastructure to support EVs. Anything that is environment friendly should have no import duties! Then don't import and build it in India. Why is the deer not working lmao? They are high cuz govt don‚Äôt wanna import them. Make them here Electric vehicles and super cars needs better infrastructure which is only seen near airports. If a normal consumer has pot holes and water logging on his street then he won't be encouraged to buy such vehicles. Surprise, let me guess so are taxes and having to pay a wage to workers.  Can't everyone just get on their knees throw money at them and beg for these saviours to grace us China is far ahead of us in electronics manufacturing. Opening the door to imported EVs now would mean killing off the domestic auto industry and ushering in Chinese imports. Further, these EVs are not going to be powered by renewables, they are going to be powered my electricity which is produced in India by burning coal, which is worse than Petrol vehicles, so there is no real environmental benefit in switching to EVs today.

We need to make our electricity grid less dependent on coal and while doing so simultaneously get the infrastructure ready to produce EVs domestically in India so that they are at least somewhat competitive compared to imports, and only then push for their adoption. This means that there needs to be a phased adoption plan which industries can depend on to decide their investments and production targets.

Why doesn‚Äôt India have more olympic medals or elite athletes,12,cfw1sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cfw1sb/why_doesnt_india_have_more_olympic_medals_or/,18,I‚Äôm just curious a question coming from an american paki whose never been back to his home country. Let‚Äôs just say for arguments sake Indians are not genetically athletic however in a sample size of 1.3 billion people you are going to have very large statistical outliers (I also don‚Äôt think Indians are not genetically inferior especially north Indians) but why haven‚Äôt they been found. China has 2 billion people and has made the most with them.They currently have track runners running 100m times in 9.8s which is enough to medal if not even win the next olympics even if Chinese are not ‚Äúathletic‚Äù in a large sample size there will be elite athletes. So why haven‚Äôt they been found in India. China also wins the second most medals and have also produces players in basketball. I‚Äôm just curious why this is with the population size.,Bigguns26," Since you compare with China, I will paste my comment from an earlier thread

> Chinese government spends $46 billion on sports, while our budget allocation in sports is around $0.5 billion.

India needs massive infrastructure to train and support its athletes. Getting Olympic medals is a long term strategy, you can't just wake up one day and hope to win a medal. Just look at Mr. Bindra and the amount of time and money he invested to win his gold medal. We need world's top coaches to train our elite athletes, which needs $$$. Culture and history: Not many role models and viable career pathways hence low base  . The cliche of a billion people is just that a cliche without substance . Very few young people engage in sports, for starters need encourage kids to play but many schools don't have playgrounds .So parents are worried about kids future and discourage  them China does not have 2 billion people, its population size is close to India at 1.3-1.5 billion, some countries have more registered professional athletes of certain sports despite having much smaller population than China and India. 

It comes down to the sport culture of a country, I'm guessing there are fewer registered athletes in India than Netherlands even, also check out the availability of sport facilities in India compared to other countries, I think it is also pretty low. 

Indians are not genetically inferior but I think religion is a great factor when it comes to nutrition, there are so many food taboos around in India that are stopping ordinary Indians from having balanced diet. This topic was discussed just yesterday. [This](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/andrew.bernard/olymp60restat_finaljournalversion.pdf) famous paper found a strong association between Olympics medal tally and GDP, population size, ""host country effect"" and ""Olympics-oriented investment"" like in Soviet Union and China. China's advantage over India is its strong economy (5 times India's GDP) and an obsessive investment in sports. Apart from the many reasons listed already it's also about the cultural apathy towards any sport which we do not already dominate in. That apathy translates to exceptional athletes with medals practically begging for food after retirement. Govt does not provide enough after care to retired athletes and they are left to fend for themselves.

Would you want your child to sacrifice education for say a chance at volleyball if you know that most players have no future after the fact? Cause Indians don‚Äôt give a fuck about anything except cricket. Kyuki pesa lgta hai Like in real life democratic political system and govt has utterly failed to provide infrastructure for sports , promote it and provide facilities and support athletes . Its a combination of genetics, culture and GDP. In all these factors, India has the worst possible state.

1. Genetics: Indians on average are shorter and fatter than all races (maybe except East Asians). There is a study which shows that for the same BMI, Indians add on more fat than any other race. Needless to say, absorbing more fat for the same BMI is not a recipe for athleticism. 

2. Culture: The diet is horrible. Full of carbs (processed nowadays) and almost no protein. Nothing to do with income either, rich people also have the bad mix of macro nutrients. No culture of physical fitness. People think going to gym is only for bodybuilders.

3. GDP: $2000 per capita is 142 out of 200 countries. India is piss poor. Dont consider PPP here, top class sports equipment doesnt cost less in India. Small schools in the US have better facilities than elite sports clubs in India.

4. Olympics: Consider the types of competitions in Olympics. I would understand if there was 1 swimming event. Instead there are dozens of different combinations of swimming related events. This excludes most poor countries where swimming pools are a luxury. Equestrian events - need I explain?",Sports,2019-07-21 14:21:35
Why Hotstar Premium sucks. [np],186,br9cdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/br9cdx/why_hotstar_premium_sucks_np/,112,"1\. *They only do good quality 1080p for Game of Thrones.*

Literally every other show, movie and documentary (with very few exceptions) has a 1080p bitrate of less than 6Mbps. Game of Thrones, meanwhile, is at 9.2Mbps, which is almost twice as heavy in terms of bitrate than other HBO titles. Even Chernobyl, a lot of which happens in the dark, has a bitrate of 5.7Mbps.

Now, 4‚Äì6Mbps isn't necessarily a bad 1080p bitrate, especially if you are a service like Netflix that knows exactly how to encode video with that kind of a limitation.

But Hotstar is no Netflix, and their encoding is not very good. 

2\. *Content is censored and/or mutilated*

Iron Man 2 is censored (and I'm not just talking about the bleeps in the Senate hearing). Like, Star World on TV level censored. Oh, and it suffers from the low-ass bitrate too. 

3\. *Omnipresent logo on top right*

Why the hell does Hotstar think it is important enough to interrupt my viewing experience with their intrusive-ass logo? What does this achieve? Their DRM is already super-annoyingly world-class (probably thanks to third party firms paid off by HBO and the like). 

And if you watch a livestream, like GoT or IPL, you are forced to see both this logo as well as the Hotstar icon on the bottom right. 

4\. *Not accessible*

Not a single one of Hotstar's titles has closed captioning. Fuck deaf people. Not a single one of Hotstar's titles has an audio description track, even if one exists for the title (eg. Hollywood/HBO). To be fair, this shortcoming applies to every Indian streaming service. Which makes no sense, since we have the second population of people with sensory impairments. 

5\. *DRM-ed to the balls*

New device? Sorry, you're requesting multiple streams at the same time. Android phone? Sorry, we cannot show you 1080p video. VPN? Don't even go there. 

6\. *All of this was preventable*

Video quality? Just have more versions of titles at a higher bitrate for people with good internet. Logo? It's not burned into the video, so just take it off. Inaccessible? Just ask rightsholders to also send subtitle files and audio description files. Make DRM just as unintrusive as other streaming services that do business with the exact same group of companies you do. Censoring? Don't fucking do it. As simple as that. Two or three jobless lawsuits are nothing for The Mouse to handle.",shadowbannedguy1," That watermarked horrible logo along with poor bitrates on videos are the top most reasons I mostly pirate the shows I watch that's on hotstar exclusively, despite being a premium subscriber. You would be better off with HBO GO and a decent VPN. You forgot to mention if you want to skip to the next episode, you have to go through the closing credits and then the screen will change. Then you have to play the episode, select subtitles and then again fast forward the opening credits. Downloaded episodes on phone expire in a day. Shitty user interface. Netflix cost 600/month. Hotstar has PL for 999/year. 

Cheap> Quality. Especially for people like me who has hardly any time to watch anything. And you forgot about the search engine of hotstar. It's literally terrible. Also no 5.1 surround sound support. Yes but for ‚Çπ999/year I won‚Äôt complain I am yet to create an account and subscribe myself onto any of the streaming services and thus, I don't have an idea about the quality and content of each streaming services but, we won't be having Disney + here right?

As in most (if not all) those Disney + shows will be hosted by Hotstar here in India? Also, Hotstar is the one that has the entire MCU library, if I'm not mistaken? For 999/year includes IPL and English Premier League. It is a STEAL for sports fans.. To think I paid ‚Çπ999 for this garbage of a season You left out the shitty user interface. Long live psarips.net I am watching Chernobyl and the quality is utter shit. Can't believe I am paying for this shit. It sucks. I saw Chernobyl ep03 tonight and despite choosing 'high' quality, the video was worse than what Netflix data-saver option would be. I mean I'm happy to pay more to have the kind of viewing experience that Chernobyl can offer but Hotstar kills it.

Also, shit goes down way too often on the Hotstar app on my TV. Log in Hotstar - 'sorry something went wrong' error Wait till the content on HS get regulated/censored. 

Premium subscriptions for HS will soon die and they will be clueless , just like they are now. They got subtitles mate. Ah, thank you for reminding. Cancelling my subscription right now üòÖ. GOT over , Game over lol . I tried Hotstar Premium when there was some cash back offer and then promptly canceled it. I reached out to [hello@hotstar.com](mailto:hello@hotstar.com) on some of the points mentioned in this post with suggestions and feedback, but just got some boilerplate reply. I refuse to pay for this kind of service. Cheaper pricing isn't enough if the experience is terrible. In comparison, Netflix is several years ahead. The Hotstar product managers seem to be inept, and tend to think like they're just re-doing cable TV over the web. üôÑ You shouldn't bother with streaming services anymore if you can help it. Sooner or later, they will end up being censored to confirm to our ""Indian standards"" and most media on them will be ruined.

It's like the Ikea of sportswear/clothing. Decathlon near my home organise events, from small walks for a cause to random cycling. Though a small town, it often has active participation of locals. 

Also, their staff are directly involved in these training activites, kinda makes the whole experience great. More than a shop, it gives a socialising platform in sports field. Thank you Decathlon, for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Asics, NB nervous.  These people have made their products like 50 -100 % more expensive in India as compared to the west.  Largely making common products out of reach for the middle class.  

Nike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement. So much so that when NRI travel to India they bring shoes as gifts to please my family. 

For context: A 100 $ Asics running shoe is  Rs14000 in India. What kind of business model is this? I'm going to decathlon for sure TIL Decathlon is French [deleted] Decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty. :) 

Fuk u Adidas I don't know of anyone's been to decathlon's in Bangalore but somehow in all of them, the helper staff seem like well off upper middle class people in their 20s, you can tell from the way they speak and dress, their English is like those South Bombay kids. I have even seen foreigners work as staff. This is very weird because you don't see people who are well off doing jobs that are considered menial by a lot of people. Does decathlon pay really well or something. Reduced visits to Decathlon, because I end up spending more than I need to. The assortment is so good and the quality is first class. I just live their shop man so big and they let you try and play with things. Even the employees at store are so friendly and helpful. I wish more brands adopt this style, I'm hopping IKEA has similar experience. 

The store in thane had very friendly environment, they trusted customers and I've seen so many times people shoplifting so they had to start tagging and deploying security at stores. That's just sad. 

These Adidas, Nike, puma deserve this. Decathlon cares about sports more than money-making... I fucking love Decathlon. Amazing quality stuff at great prices. I just wish they make a shopping app. Or at least do something w their website. It's really buggy or something Decathlon, The Hamley's for Adults What's the difference between their dry, dry+ and dry+ breathe running t shirts? I heard great things about them from my buddies (so their word of mouth advertising seems to be working well) - will have to visit one day. it is pronounced ""di-ka-thlo"" if anyone is interested I just love Decathlon for their product quality and excellent pricing. It's my go to shop for shoes clothes and basic sport goods. 

I have met many disabled employees at the Pune store (and I'm sure they proactively encourage and hire) which really improves their brand image in front of me. Most of their staff is super young so kudos to them for employing out country's young guns. 

Their staff is excellently trained and helps you get the best item possible. Kids cycling and playing in store brings a smile to my face. 

If anyone from Decathlon is reading this - Thank you for coming to India! :) I love my decathlon. You can get some nice quality stuff for cheap. the store design is one of the best aspect of them. Explore all you want and buy what you like no interference from staff unless you need it This is really popular in hyderabad This is the place where I end up buying shit I don't need. Nike, Adidas, Puma etc. are expensive just because they want to recover their huge investments in marketing Do they happen to sell them online?? I'm hearing about this brand for the first time üòÖ Decathlon is my prefferd showroom to buy shoes, pant & physical fitness related things This should be an obvious middle finger in the faces of Nike and other over expensive brands. Decathlon stuff is amazing value for money. Somewhere I read this ""Decathlon is Hamleys for adults"" Shower thought: Decathlon is basically Hamleys for adults. I love everything about them but hate their trail rooms. Everything is perfect there but why they have coffin like squeezy trail rooms? Mostly i have seen people who are into sport there 5:10-6 ft easily, i wonder how they manage in their. I am 5:9 and i find it really difficult to especially for bottom wears. I love Decathlon.
I also only buy running/cross-training shoes (or such critical gear) only from nike(or high quality brands).
It may make little to no difference where your shorts or t-shirts are from, but if you're an active runner/player it's important to invest in the right pair of shoes or equipment.
Sure Decathlon is amazingly affordable, while nike is exorbitantly overpriced, but there are clear and significant reasons to also get nike.
Foot calluses or even alignment and stride, or injuries are difficult to avoid if you're hitting the pavement or the treadmill for 10km 3 times a week. If you can reduce probability by even 10%, the high price is worth it. After they opened in Chennai I stopped bothering with the other brands, much more affordable imo.

Cricket Corruption | Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj | Netflix,128,bth74c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5DWJv1hiwM,56,,teslaluvrs," I think  the 2008 Harbahajan Singh - Symonds episode should have been handled more maturely . It was more nuanced than that . Sadly Hasan Took the easy way out and decried it as racism. Man that interview with Lalit Modi ( another Modi ha ha ) was funny af The episode is fine. But tbh he doesn't stress enough on the fact that why BCCI  does what it does. India being the most populous cricket playing nation, generates the most revenue. Naturally it would want the major chunk of it so that it could be used to distribute to the state cricket boards. This would only help in improving the facilities in the country. It might not be the most morally right thing to do but it also is not that wrong. It is a classic capitalist move. This is classic american mentality when they bully instituations for thier countries bennifits..its justified.. 

But when others do it it's curruption...

BCCI bully ICC becuase we supply major chunk of thier revenue. India gives cricketers arround the world opportunity and money. So ya BCCI have every right to be selfish and use thier leverage. BCCI use that money to improve stadiums and give more opportunities to young players.

I am not going to deny that BCCI doesn't have internal corruption but its no where near the level of past.. and after all the scandals in recent past BCCI has realised that its in thier best interest to stay out of politics... so i see no reason to be angry towards BCCI now. Just another recent case.. Australia and England were allowed to withdraw their players from the IPL for world cup prep. South Africa also wanted to do the same, but India blackmailed them with the cancelation of a tour after world cup. The big three at work again!

Ps. This is only a rumour and very few articles came out. But Ottis Gibson (coach of RSA) publicly said ""It would have been great had our players came back earlier"" and there were commentators who were talking about it at times too. But yeah, it is totally plausible. Does anyone else find him annoying? Ah yeah let me comment on others house made of glass while I sit in my comfort zone inside a well built fenced house.
I will only identify myself as an Indian while playing the victim card. 
Just sayin. I stopped watching IPL a few years ago as it became too many matches for me to care. Glad I did. Even FIFA is more interesting with all their scandals as it happens once every few years instead of every year! Is it bad that I feel proud when he says ""BCCI made ICC it's bitch.""

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

What are your thoughts ?",SlapMak," The main reason that esports hasn't flourished in India yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who don't play games are not educated about the potential of esports and it's success in other countries. Parents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real job.

Second reason is that we Indians don't spend a lot of money, especially on luxury goods, and good PCs are luxury. Hence parents don't feel like it's worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatile.

If we want esports to grow in India, we need to educate people about it. It was difficult in America itself to accept esports as a profession.

Danish PM playing with Astralis (considered best CSGO team ever) was just a PR move around their election time. That being said, a number of top-tier talents come from Nordic and Scandinavian region.

That being said, a career in esports is still not viable even outside, let alone here. If you're not a talent in a top org, bills become hard to pay. There have been many instances where talented people/ teams had to raise funds from the community itself. I don't know about other games, but Indian CSGO ""pros"" don't have the talent like the EU players. They are just way better. EU just owns.

Also to make big bucks, we ll have to invest time and money. Especially Esports. Also doing it unless you are absolutely sure? Investing thousands of hours practicing? Do you think the ""society"" will accept it? They ll just brand the guy ""addicted to gaming, gaming is bad, it should be banned"". Crosspost to r/indiangaming as well We need a break out star in a competitive game(like faker or sumail) so we can kick start more poeple in our country. We have teams but they are just so far behind international standards... But hopeful since we have so many tournaments now than compared to last decade... In my local area, a lot of gaming pubs host DOTA and CSGO tournaments.

But I believe it's gonna be a long while before esports becomes recognised over here. Unless people take gaming seriously nothing's gonna happen. Half of my friends didn't knew PUBG was a thing unless it hit the play store. I feel pathetic for people calling themselves gamers who play on mobile and despise PC gaming. ( My friends tease me for playing games on PC saying I have no life and shit and yet they play PUBG the whole day. )

Esports won't be a thing unless someone is ready to take flak head on from the Indian society. Our aunties and unkills who believe in doctor and engineer species only. I hope someone revives it.

In the few years I've seen some really great Indian born games on mobile gaming platform. They're not 10/10 but at least they're of the same quality we deserve compared to the western counterpart.

Recently our college was creating clubs. I wanted to make an Esports club badly but I realized 90% of my colleagues wouldn't know its meaning. The idea got buried. Even if I did manage to get the courage and tell my faculties I want an Esports club and explain them, I m pretty sure they'd laugh their ass off and forget about it next day. The general rat culture in our country does not provide a conducive environment for competitive games like Dota/CSGO to flourish.

We might have more players than Europe but the skill level is terrible I don't thing pubg mobile is going anywhere when it comes to esports. It's not precise enough cause touch screen for an event involving skill Give it another 10 years and it will become an Olympic Sport. First of all, let [Redeye talk some sense into you. It's esports.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO8IaV_DAoY) 

I'm a fellow competitive csgo follower (RIP Astralis era btw). Majority of India has no concept of esports. I think we need to convince a certain influential Gujarati man to educate our masses about esports, because I see no other way of esports growth in India. Not in the near future at least. People don't considered gaming/streaming an occupation here. I bet most of the people don't know about joining esport orgs For e sports to be a thing people must buy the damn games.Excluding cheap and free games like CS,Dota,TF2 etc which game has a large enough player base to even ask this question? pc parts cost 2x more in India and people don't think its good investment. The reason why esports haven't taken off in India is that we don't have any fallback options. There are no social safety net and any breaks taken during education is extremely frowned upon by Indian society and in extent Indian firms. Let's say, you try your hands on esports, you play well but not good enough to make a living out of it. Then you need to get a job and that's only backed up by education. No firm will hire you if you put esports in your cv. Not to mention if you take a break in your studies to pursue esports, there's a good chance your cv will be thrown into the dustbin even before it reaches the interviewer.

The same is applicable for other type of sports. Football is very popular in West Bengal, but most players are struggling hard to make ends meet. If you've watched Dangal then you'd know what happens to Amir in the movie is a reflection of what happens to our society in general. The only two ways to make an honest living in India is either through education or through business. Esports won't help you in either in the long run. Don't you remember the PM referencing pubg? I feel that e-sports is pernicious for the society in general. It promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. Playing video-games for long enough to become the best at them ought to have a deleterious effect on one's health, both physical and mental. Even though I love playing video games, Sports for me is still something physical. Sports? Are they still calling them sports to make them feel and sound more legit? Lol",Sports,2019-06-04 12:51:09
Request Dhoni to remove Army insignia from gloves: ICC to BCCI,73,bxiedb,https://m.timesofindia.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/request-dhoni-to-remove-army-insignia-from-gloves-icc-to-bcci/amp_articleshow/69678580.cms,33,,buzzenwired," I don't see anything wrong with wearing gloves. Dude is an honorary army man, supports the army... What's wrong with that? It's just gloves. Trivial bullshit is trivial. I don't mind them asking Dhoni to remove the insignia as long as they don't entertain any other political gestures from anyone else. But the problem is far too many have gotten away with it. Enforce the rule strictly and consistently. Otherwise, their request carries no weight. How does it hurt ? Wtf ? Tributes are done everywhere , I get rules are rules. 
How does cosmetic change affect the game ? 

Can somebody enlighten me ? Yeah they have a point. Dhoni should instead go at the border and fight instead of playing sports if he can't part with indian armies even while playing. Good. request ? he should be fined. whats with request ? if he violated the rules..he should be fined. Social Media is making this matter more highlighted. There are some rules & regulations of ICC which should be followed by the cricket playing nations.

I‚Äôve read his book, but I want to hear some personal accounts and experiences. How could the everyday Indian feel the impact of this event - if any? Was it celebrated nationwide? How did it impact the culture? Did anything change? How significant was this day in 2008 - and the man?

Any and all comments are welcome! Thank you!!",nellerhk," Nothing changed for other sports, shooting is for the elite and well connected. The laws in India prevent any common man in India to get into shooting. For example the purchase of an airgun requires you to be first a member of a shooting club, these clubs don't entertain applications unless you know someone or bribe them to give you membership, these people are fucking corrupt as hell and will treat you like a piece of shit unless you are well connected.  Purchase of a fire arm is next to impossible for the common man. They will never give you a firearm license if you say you want it for sport. Majority of the indian shooters come from law-enforcement and military community. 

This sport is for the upper elite, there is no grassroot sport shooting revolution, may be there are more rich shooters now. I think the Olympic gold did capture public attention. Coupled with India hosting Commonwealth games just after it, and doing well there, there has been more attention to Olympic sports. Of course, the attention isn't very detailed and sports ministry still lacks significant accountability mechanisms, but I feel there is more interest in Olympic sport athletes.

Is cricket really that popular outside India?,13,c55wl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c55wl5/is_cricket_really_that_popular_outside_india/,16,"I mean, the main issue I see with ODI cricket its just a big test of patience at times. Unlike any huge game, like soccer, rugby, baseball, hockey, etc. Cricket is just too too long.   
   
I loved ODIs during my childhood but nowadays I just can't help but say that IPL is infinitely more exciting than ODIs.    
  
Is cricket locally as popular in any other country? Except India or the subcontinent? I mean there are teams from plenty countries, but is cricket actually popular in the streets or base level there?",mylackey," TLDR - No. 

Real answer - ICC isn‚Äôt really interesting in growing the game unless it can find $$$ there, which is why it‚Äôll try to grow the game in the US but do jack shit for UAE despite being HQ‚Äôd in it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've been wondering the same thing. Currently in the US and there are a lot of British expats at work and none seem to be following cricket. I'm beginning to think that ever since the 2010s after India won the world cup, the game has become ""more South Asian"" for lack of a better phrase. Growing up in the 90s, it wasn't like this. British and Aussie cricketers were not just sports stars but we're also page 3 personalities. I don't think it is like that anymore. Does anyone remember Shane Warne and Liz Hurley? I believe there is a change in the demographic. As someone else mentioned in this thread, the Brits at work are actually more interested in the Women's soccer world cup than icc. I guess the grapes are sour? I would say outside the subcontinent cricket is a very 'niche' sport - it does have followers and some kids playing it, but not really big among the general pubic. Who gives a shit . Americans themselves don‚Äôt bother if their sports are popular elsewhere neither should we . Sub continent where a quarter of the world population follows it generates decent revenues for the ICC. Australia has proper cricket fans who aren't seasonal followers of the game #No I can tell that in the nordic regions, Cricket is pretty much a niche sport. There are a few clubs who play cricket but thats about it, the general public do not care about it. In the UK more people are following the Women's World Cup (soccer) than they are the cricket world cup.  Wimbeldon has started and so the CCWC is probably down to number 3 in terms of viewing figures.  In terms of general interest...it's niche. Nope, even Australia and England has stopped caring for it that much. Its become a niche sport outside of India.

And i believe the BCCI and ICC are responsible for it. Hasan Minhaj summaries it quite well in his [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5DWJv1hiwM)",Sports,2019-06-25 17:41:06

My mechanical professor misbehaved with a cute northie. Suspended.

Another mechanical professor (also hostel warden) tortured hostel students, he shit his pants when one student drank all-out mosquito repellant. He liked students who are scared easily and act like slaves. He had some kind of joy feeling powerful over these helpless kids who came to unknown city and stayed in that hostel.

My school math teacher was a hardcore christian, she gave special care to christian students. A non-christian student not scoring is dumb, but a christian student not scoring needed practice. 

Tuition teacher prefers talkative and jovial ones, he was a strict math teacher in KV but jovial and friendly guy in his tuition classes. He even teaches shortcuts and easy methods in tuition but not in school.

PT teacher was hell bent on sports and never let other teachers take PT period as substitute for their subjects. We all loved her. She liked the ones who got her medals in zonals.

My computer teacher liked the ones who are smart and answers questions first..Imagine students like Hermione from harry potter. 

Biology teacher was the best who genuinely worried about underperforming students. Never gave special attention to top students as they never needed it in first place


To answer your question, i think this is all subjective. i think it all comes down to have a student behaves with a teacher cuz even they are human and then comes all the other factors like academic performance etx [deleted] Kids who interact in class - not the ones who stare into the abyss like brain-dead zombies. Kids who question, challenge and provide alternative to what I teach. Kids who are cool and talk wittily - not the ""yes, sir"" kind of flattering dorks. I like if they are involved in extra-curricular activities, but it should not be at the cost of their primary goal - education.

P.S.: I am an Assistant Professor (Engineering) in a top government college. I teach online and one on one which makes for a very different experience than classroom teaching - the most inspiring ones are those who never give up. They may be less gifted, and scores may disappoint. But they tenaciously keep working and in the end their results have always surprised me.

Just last year one student who i taught over two years and despaired for his performance made it through to NIT Surathkal.

Another guy who I briefly taught in 10th, was pretty ordinary, but made up for that with insane amounts of work and got into IIT-B. There he stepped it up sleeping only 4 hours a day on occasion and won the Presidents Gold Medal. When he graduated, Stanford and MIT rolled out red carpets to welcome him to their campus.

I could go on, but these two really stood out. Not a full time teacher; help a few kids in my neighborhood with their studies. I try to get them to stay inquisitive, ask questions & accept it is alright to say ""I don't know"". School education discourages then from asking questions (especially if it falls outside their syllabus). [removed] Toppers Dead I like the ones who are curious about things.

Doesn't matter which subject music/sport/science/business/cooking/art whatever. They go and try to find the answers and come back with many questions. Watching that process, of them discovering things for the first time by their own effort is very inspiring and satisfying. IANAT but other half is. 

Recently she was most impressed by a student who was deported from another school after failing, came here, continued to do poorly upto preparatory exams but got things together, concentrated and worked hard and ended up in high sixties (%). Approaching the exams she used to say I will be most happy if this kid passes. And was ecstatic to see his scores finally. There were many kids in 90+ and 80+ range in the same batch.

"Thank you, MSD. The great Indian captain, the greater life coach.",7,cbtecp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cbtecp/thank_you_msd_the_great_indian_captain_the/,5,"Just trying to put some words for MS after last night defeat & surely his last meaningful ODI in the blue. A lot of what MS achieved & how it achieved transcends cricket & sports in general & that's why I think it's more suited to talk about here than r/cricket. He is the embodiment of the India that can reach to the top & while doing be utmost reverential to ones around, respectful of those who came before, and supportive of those coming after. 

MS is a transformational cricketer in every sense of the world. Just like you can demarcate India's economy with pre & post liberalization, you can actually demarcate Indian cricket pre & post Dhoni. Pre MSD, we were a good team that might win it all one day. We had couples of fairytale matches, the NatWest final, comes to mind that would cherish for ages, and we had some of world's best players. But we didn't use to win as much. We learned how to reach the finals, but we lacked the how to win it. 

Post MS, we became favourites in most tournaments we enter. Again, we don't win everything that's in front of us like those big bad Aussies but every time we don't, it feels like one off day. Not an structural problem. We might be having more of these now. But MS came, he changed us, and delivered a World Cup. Before than he delivered a T20 cup, and after as an encore delivered a Champions Trophy. He also won us the mace of the best test team. We just started winning more. We were not scared of losing the match in first five over anymore. We had our finisher. Now, it was the time for them to be scared of us.

It's a testament to his resolve that a boy with not-so-great technique reached here, and it's a celebration of India's cricket that a boy from Ranchi could reach here. No longer is Indian cricket in those urban metro pockets. No longer a kid in Mumbai is sure to be in the team more than that kid from some tier 2 / tier 3 town whose father is working in small public sector job. Now, they compete for same prize. I hope India gets a transformational player from North East too, and truly make Indian cricket ""Indian"" cricket.

MSD truly changed us. If you don't see, just look at all the other Asian team around us, they win because of their individual brilliance, but they not outperform their ceiling. We were once like them. Then we started being not like them. We became a unit that wins. And, there's no one to thank more than MSD for that. 

Thank you, skip, the pleasure was all ours. Farewell. If I want to learn one thing from you, it's the ability to take both wins & losses, both good & bad, in the same way, in the same stride. For both are just impostors in this battle called life anyway.",cfc19, Never forget the way he took advantage of his position to push in players from Rhiti Sports.

Idk why but I just don't like Virat for his this behaviour. I also don't know the truth about what he screams or cries in an ongoing match but it seems more like some abusive word or an insult for opposing team players. He is a great sportsman but he should realise the fact that he is role model for young and aspiring players.",koibhinhi," I don't think anyone rates him for his  personality, He is a brilliant cricketer with the typical mainstream Punjabi/Delhi attitude.  If it was not for his cricketing talent and hardwork, he would've been another Sreensanth. When did this become Unpopular? It‚Äôs a free country. He is as free to be himself as you are to dislike him. Why devote so much time to thinking about people who have no influence on your life whatsoever? I have gone from being a hater to absolutely adoring him (no homo). 

He earned all the respect through unbelievable consistency, performing everywhere in the world and conquering all challenges posed to him. Kohli is probably not as gifted as Sachin BUT he more than makes up for that through elite level of fitness that allows him to run doubles after scoring a hundred at same speed when he came on the crease. 

He plays cricket for India and is bloody good at it, that's all that matters. If you want to hear his side of the story then watch Nat Geo Masterclass episode on him.

Edit: No doubt he's bit of an asshole. He's a sports person and every sports person has their own style. You can see that in different sports as well. See Ronaldo, Djokovic they have so much anger on the field because that helps them. So what's wrong? 
He's not the most talented cricketer like Rohit Sharma, but he's the best cricketer in the world right now due to his hard work and  determination and dedication to fitness.
( I met Virat once off the field, he's a really kind person and gentleman. ) I don't care about his personality. He's a great player. Rohit sharma is a gifted and telented batsman.However , Virat kohli is Hardworking batsman and if history has proven one thing that is hardwork beats talents. If you see earlier records(under nineteenth even couple of years after) compare Rohit sharma and virat kohli you will find that sharma was little ahead and cricket came naturally to him.However Virat kohli is diciplined ,hardworker and he did not had butter chicken in last 4 years(heard in an interview) compare love handles of rohit sharma.Nothing against rohit sharma, Scoring 264 in an international is nothing sort of a miracle. But virat kohli is different he has picked his sacrifices ,He is impatience but compensate with perseverance. He is constantly trying improve not only his game but also in other life aspects.Whenever he is on Buses he make sure that he reads self improvement book.I am not fan of virat kohli but i am fan of his dicipline and regime. Aggression is absolutely necessary in competitive sports. Cricket in particular. 

Some manifest that aggression through shrewd tactics, some do it in body language, and some really talented ones do both. Whats up with everyone hating his aggression on the field?

Just because Dhoni was cool, not everyone can be like him

If you are expecting everyone to be nice to everyone then you must living in an another dimension I don't understand the folks here. First you guys cry about the 'Log Kya kahenge' attitude of parents. And when someone doesn't give a damn about it, you turn back and say ' Hooo, you're a role-model, act like it'. Why TF should he care what people & kids think about him? Sexy cricketer though, his batting is poetry in motion. Doesn't hurt that the helmet means I don't have to look at his face.

>What worries me is that a lot of young kids tend to copy Virat, without realising that they are not being authentic to who they really are. Guys, there is a term called sportsmanship. It means playing competitively and yet respecting the game and the opponent players. You just cant go bad mouthing and showing frustation every time you get a chance. Thatbis just bad faith. First Kohli seemed to do this coz of his immense passion, these days it seems like he just fcuking hates his opponents. No matter how good you are, when you play at the level he is, you habe the resposibility of maintaining a decorum. See tennis for reference. I'm glad others in this world who care about cricket see Kohli's abuse-filled aggression as a passion for the game. No doubt he's one of the best in the world out there, but if the same abuse that he spews on-field if done on the street he could face criminal charges for abusive behaviour. Sadly commentators misinterpret as the passion so does the media, and budding cricketers and youth use the same in their field of work too. [deleted] Slightly late to the party but anywho -

This was evident by the way he has carried himself in the public eye, most remarkably when he defended his then-girlfriend (and now wife) Anushka Sharma when she was getting trolled by his supporters. It is important to note that he started his career at an early age and since then, he has been under scrutiny. All of us were dumb as teenagers, just that our antics were not scrutinized by the media. 

If anything, Virat Kohli should be a role model for all young boys. He lost his father when he was barely in his teens, went to play a match while grieving his death, led his team to victory, made the team, became the best damn player that India has seen in a long time and is now leading the team to victory in the CWC. That too, without any connections or influence - purely on the basis of his talent and hard work. He also seems to be popular with his team and has their respect and support. He is a supportive husband who is not afraid to show his love for his wife and to stand up for her. His aggression is a part of his game and it is what makes him, him. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a valid reason to hate on him, given that the aggression has never transformed into anger issues giving way to physical violence. 

He is a shining example of how your talent and hard work can take you to dizzying heights. As far as pure skill and temperament goes he is in his own league. He is better than sachin. I don't think He's overrated.  He deserves to run his mouth and act like douche all he wants if he can back it up. You don't have to love his personality, just his cricket. 

Makes it all the more fun and satisfying to watch him be cocky and then get outplayed and humbled by the other team every once in a while. I loved old virat... exactly for his hot headed behavior.

In this country woth all our bullshit like repect elder, respect the tradition, act mature bla bla bla he was such a nice change..

He used to have ""fuck you i have skills back up my attitude"" mentality which was so fucking inspirational. India needed young energy like him which showed that skill and hard work are the most important not sucking to people above you.

Now he has matured though which is also good.

In a healthy society hard working successful people should be  celebrated and respected..virat is beast when it comes to hardwork He is a great player which is what matters I'm a big big Kohli fan. 

He's a run machine. Probably the best white ball batsman ever. Never ever seen someone so consistent as him. The only thing that keeps him going is his ferocious intensity. On field he might be a nightmare for opposition, but off the field, he does come across as a very cool guy. Have seen almost all of his interviews and found none where he acted as a dick. 

Everyone has their own strengths that gets the best of out them. Dhoni's calmness maybe, but for Virat, it's his agression and intensity. 

As Harsha Bhogle said it, you take intensity out of Kohli, there's no Kohli left. 

Btw, Dhoni isn't cool/calm. Raina had pointed it out during one interview that Dhoni frequently gives a stick (which is not wrong). Abused Manish on camera ( again, nothing wrong) and latest where he came on field to confront the umpire for the no-ball call. I realized it a long time ago, before he was crowned a legendary status. You woke up pretty late. I have never seen a biggest snob in the sports before Kohli. Overrated? No motherfucker he's not. You'll understand when you start watching cricket. I don't know why Indian fans are so obsessed with behaviour. A cousin who lives in Australia told me how many fans he has there. FFS, understand the sport. You'll know he's already a legend. And he's better than Dhoni. Idk why Dhoni has more fans than Sachin and Dravid. Dhoni can't perform outside India. He's overrated. Yeah, I know this comment will be downvoted to oblivion. No shit. People are generally pretty obnoxious when it comes to Hero worship, and the cricket fans take it to the next level. I support this opinion. He is absolutely loved by media
 No questions are asked about his captaincy, decisions,...etc. just let off.. >he is role model for young and aspiring players.

But the users have taken these platforms bit too far. >My son was so engrossed in PUBG game that he played it from Sunday evening to early hours of Monday. He slept for a few hours and after getting up had his breakfast and then played the game for six hours at a stretch.

If he was doing this for several days then it's a case of chronic sleep deprivation.

Let's just keep our fingers crossed that she doesn't get ostracized,given the 13th century mentality people have.
***
Just a general observation on the worldviews Indians have.
If you take a look at the article, you'll find some comments. The comment section is enlightening.

""Natural couples can procreate, but unnatural cannot..If unnatural is to become a norm, then we have to think seriously of bio-ethical issues arising therefrom..Better go the nature's way though we have got freedom, we can use it either way.""

""Shows a great decline in ethical and value understanding, forgetting what our ancestors (the great rishis) and developing a slavish western educated attitude(so-called modern)
Doom is near when we forget ours roots.""
***
This is a very very *healthy sign* that the times we are livin' in is 1319,not 2019.
As for the rishis,if this gentleman had the time to look into our scriptures,he would find the Ardhanarishwara form(which celebrates feminity). Countless other refutes could be provided.
It's high time,we step up the ante,and counter them. These kind of mentality would only cause our society to move towards an intellectual dark age. 
I'm simply surprised,that every divine pronouncement is taken support to voice his beliefs about ""unnaturality"" and the fact that ""it won't support procreation"".
Sir, we're already with a burden of overpopulation. If some people don't procreate (by virtue of nature), it's for better. More power to her. brave. respect to her God bless her, and may she get strength to win more medals for india Hope people to support her online, will do the same in real life too.

It's hard to be out in India, but those that are able to do it do such an important service to all the struggling young LGBT kids. I'm so proud of her! 

Speaking of Indian lesbians, I recently watched Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga. I'll be honest, I've always disliked Sonam and Anil Kapoor for their acting. But the movie, was really touching. 

It helped a lot that Sonam didn't wear much makeup and it was not glamour-themed like most movies are. It helped to focus on the plotline which I think was VERY cute. 


PS: if anyone has seen the movie, can you tell me what the name ""Kuhu"" Means? It's an adorable name.

Okay serious question.

Dutee Chand has been found to have high testosterone because of hyperandrogenism. She was even banned once by IAAF all though got reversed later. Does her high T has to do anything with her sexual orientation? Isn't she the same ahtelte who was suspended or something for not being a woman? Good for population control. Go girl ! Nobody cares!

You are not allowed to touch equipments, javelin throw, table tennis, etc. are either rusted lying in a corner or being used only by popular kids. 

Only the popular kids who keep in touch with the sports teacher are only allowed for tournaments and stuff.

Not against the idea but we used to have 2 sports period a week where we were just left like stray dogs out in the scorching heat feeling free to do whatever the fuck we wanted (as long as it was confined to the open ground). 
No proper sports outfit, no proper sports equipment, infrastructure, most importance, seriousness. 
Schools pretend to be caring about a student's physical development. Rather than increasing eve frequency, come up with a well designed plan and test it for a smaller frequency.

I wish some sense prevails and TRAI brings back revised older tariff as even the pack with all my favorite channels set me back only around 400 and for the same now, I need to pay for 700!! WTF! They must limit the rate of broadcaster bouquet packs. e.g. the rate of HBO HD is 12Rs. While the Turner HD+ pack of HBO, Disney, WB is 12.50 Rs. So why would anyone choose just a single channel if they can get more channel at the same rate or slightly more? There must be a rule that the rate of a bouquet must not less than, say 70% of total of rates of channels. Then only broadcasters will be forced to keep the price per channel low.

Screw you TRAI^2 TRAI has always been a loser when it came to the public. They were not able to reduce the call drops. They totally screwed us during net neutrality until (due to immense public pressure) they decided to go with it. And now this. Its time TRAI is held accountable for its existence.  TRAI anticipates that channel prices will come down gradually.

But I'd say get a firestick , a decent broadband connection and subscription of those streaming apps. I switched and never lookd back to DTH.  I am an Indian who stays in bangalore who watches content from almost all the channels (kannada, tamil, telugu, hindi, english) and I have to pay almost around 800 ish if I want to have the same experience. So fuck me right TRAI. Real dick move by TRAI This pricing scheme is helpful only for people who watched very few channels to begin with. TRAI had put a cap on discount that operators could provide in bouquets. 15% max discount on bouquet than a-la-carte. That would have gotten the price of individual channels down. All operators went to Madras High Court against this rule where HC ruled against TRAI. With much lower prices for bouquets than a-la-carte, operators are basically forcing you to take their bouquets instead of going alacarte way. [As of now, TRAI has withdrawn 15% discount cap petition from Supreme Court] Same here.

My yearly subscription will end soon. I have already subscribed to Sony Liv and Zee5. Will subscribe to Hotstar soon and too voot when they will have live channel available (they don't have subscription model as of today). It will cost me around INR 3000  per year. I have got 150gb broadband connection which is never utilized. So I'll be getting all the channels for 250 per month and since I have multiple TV, the average will be much less. I thank TRAI for screwing up this well. I think I was way too comfortable with what I had. They made me rethink the entire cabel cost optimization. Removed sony channels. Got Sony liv yearly subscription.   I used to pay 280 for all the channels, now I have to pay 600 for the channels which me and my parents watch. Go to hell TRAI.  Mine went from 280 to 200 [deleted] I used to pay 600ish monthly. Now it's half that. Thank you TRAI, I guess? Cost reduced for them who only watched Republic TV.. Mine went down from 300 to 275.

I watch only SD and don't have any hindi GECs. I think those channels are really expensive and pack costs have gone up for those watching hindi GECs.. for rest there is definitely a decline.

Also those who watch a limited number of channels have benefited while those who watch a large set have been fucked. TRAI are absolute dickheads.. We should also blame the government for letting this happen.  Tbh the problem isn't with TRAI , it's the nature of DTH and cable market which is against any good reform in the sector. By bumping up each channel rates to such an high price they say either toe the bouquet way or opt the alacarte model at your peril. 

I hope in coming days they reform the cost of Channels to the optimum cost. I'm on the other side of the coin. 

My monthly cost came down because I barely watch TV. I just picked the packs for channels my mom watches and I was done. I just add the sports channels on the days when there are matches I want to watch and remove them the next day.  

Thanks TRAI. Just like GST made everything cheaper :P This is what i'm getting for Rs.335 in Tatasky

 That's it. Ridiculous.  ""Your costs will be lower when you stop watching TV"" -- xoxo, TRAI I was paying 550 + 250 for a long duration pack. Now paying 300 + 250 (multi TV) Earlier you were probably being subsidised by those users watching fewer channels paying more than what they actually needed. Time to pay your fair share.

Looking at the pricing on TRAI [website](https://channel.trai.gov.in/), most of the channels cost ‚Çπ7 or less. Of those you mentioned, Sony, Sony sports channels and Colors cost ‚Çπ19 (and even these are available in bouquets to lower costs). I don't see how you can be mad at TRAI when they're instituting a per channel pricing and making it transparent. I don't understand how can anyone enjoy all the stupid bullshit they show on Indian tv. In recent years Indian influences have destroyed the only good channels worth watching like CN, NICK, DISCOVERY, NAT GEO, HISTORY etc.. Anyone intelligent in their right mind would cut the cable and use internet to watch anything entertaining. I had to keep the connection just for my parents and they too don't watch serials and all the vomit inducing reality shows. So this new system is pretty great for me. I just chose very few channels that we actually flip through. only 300 rs. 
 Try getting packs...I only watch sports (football) and I got a pack that was cheaper than selecting one by one, use the trai website to see cheapest plan I think those who watch more channels should be given some discount . I pay  250 for cable, and have almost channels.
Except some sports channels. Because they are expensive.
Now we will have to pay shit loads. Same here. I used to pay 400 for all HD and SD channels. Now I am getting only sony sports pack and star value pack.
I am actually shocked.
I am just waiting for Giga fiber and giga tv.  Exactly!

Had to forego the HD channels in order to get my prices lower than the previous package which had HD + SD. I have 4 tata sky connections. 1 primary and 3 multi tv(you have to pay full cost for primary and 250 each for multi tv). Out of the 4 TVs, 2 are HD supporting and other 2 are old school CRT. 

I was paying 750 for my primary and another 250+250+250 for my other connections. I had all HD & SD channels tata sky offers on its platform.

Now if I subscribe to a HD channel, I don't get its corresponding SD channel with it. So i can't watch HD channels now.

FUCK YOU TRAI I think these new DTH rules will benefit us in the long run.

As people start subscribing lesser number of channels, expect broadcasters to reduce their prices. Channels will lose a great deal of advertising revenue if they continue to price their channels so high.

My opinion - Wait and watch for a couple of months. Things will become clear.  Some people here and in other similar threads claim that hotstar and Sonyliv is a viable alternative. It's simply not for sports. I've a decent net plan (around 50mbps) and yet, when India plays, the quality is pathetic (Looks like 144p even when you select full HD) . It's alright while watching on your phone but you simply can't watch it on your TV.  Ftom 250 earlier to a steep 610 this month.

Fuck you TRAI and your ""Revolutionary"" step.  Iptv is your friend There are bouquet(bundled channels from company) eg-Times now hd bouquet at 15rs includes mn+,movies now,mnx,romedy now etc.
Choose the channels wisely ,for me it has reduced from 400 to 230rs. from my understanding, this whole exercise was to make dth expensive and complicated for the normal household. so that when jiofiber comes with all inclusive plan, customers would flock to it. and dth companies would disappear the same way most of the telecom companies have disappeared. in the end, only tata sky might survive along with airtel.  Do people actually still watch TV? Mine went from 420 a month to 320 I think Go for a google certified android box or you are in luck if you have android tv :) prefer online apps maybe one day they will come up with providing the option of the individual channel pay on IPTV :) Wait for JIO cable to come, it will be cheap then. Hey, let's not blame TRAI. They are really laying foundation for the future by forcing people to cut cabke/dth and move to online services. What an idea.

Is it only me or many of you have lost interest in IPL?,64,b4m3qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4m3qf/is_it_only_me_or_many_of_you_have_lost_interest/,56,"I followed the IPL for the first 3 editions and then my interest got reduced to the Semi Finals and the Finals in the later editions. 

Maybe, cricket fatigue is a thing. ",_RandomRedditor," Cricket fatigue is definitely a thing, especially if your favourite team performs bad year after year.

I stopped watching Cricket after the loss in 2015 WC and the ban of CSK in 2015. I remember being too bored and tired of it.

I started watching Cricket again from last year's IPL and found myself enjoying it again. Last year's IPL was amazing. Its made all the more fun by participating in the live threads on r/Cricket. i am in with you. IPL is too much hype and the teams dont give a shit I hope it doesn‚Äôt tire them out before the World Cup. All Indian team players should take it easy and use the matches as practice. I agree, idk wtf happened to rcb.  Like everything in life. Bro I stopped watching cricket after 12 std. Got too bored. You have grown older, now you shoulder more responsibilities. IPL has started already? I'm not kidding. I seriously wasn't aware.  Yep. I miss the olden days of cricket. It's hard to stay interested if a month-and-half(?) long event that happens every year. The players keep hopping teams. BCCI adds and removes teams as it pleases. Nothing about the format inspires loyalty towards any team. The whole tournament is designed to squeeze out maximum number of matches.

But in general I stopped caring about cricket a while ago so that's definitely the biggest reason.  I lost interest after 2011.

It all started looking fake (for me) and all sugar coated stuff. Plus all the money that goes into it. Not sport but manufactured entertainment. Slowly losing interest cause my team keeps losing.  Not just you. I only watched the first edition of IPL out of novelty. Then I used to fake interest in order to fit in. Now I don't care. >I followed the IPL for the first 3 editions. 

Same here. I lost interest after 2011.

It all started looking fake (for me) and all sugar coated stuff. Plus all the money that goes into it. My interest has actually grown more than ever. :) so many matches. I can't even recall the name of team now. yep for first 2-3 seasons was good. 

But too many matches. I have stopped watching test n one day also. 

Only 20-20 n all world cups. I lost interest in IPL 2 itself I've lost interest in cricket. I don't even recognize some players in our current national team.

IPL is one of the reasons I lost interest.

Just too much cricket.  Give it a time. Its just first match. Few interesting matches and you'll be discussing/checking score every minute.  Stopped watching cricket after the college. Stopped following after Dravid retired. I lost interest after major players moved to different teams, so this was several years ato. The team's didn't mean anything to me anymore. Lost interest.  same here bro   
not following from atleast 3 years I watched the motobhai team documentary (I have a daily data quota and I intend to use  it to the full). Pretty boring but I was in suspense since I didn't know the result and was pleasantly surprised when the team was booted before the knock-off stages started. 

I'm just tangentially aware but it seems like either Dhoni's or Chowkidar Gambhirs team wins every year. I think even the more avid fans will be giving it a miss this time. The World Cup is just around the corner for Gods sake! Who the eff gives a flying eff for T20s right now! dream11 will bring back that ""interest""? :P They already play 370 days a year and now this IPL , one series ends n they leave for another . I am really bored to be honest. I don't watch cricket, never did. No interest in cricket. Sitting in front of the TV was not an option in school days and college life was too hectic. After college finished there's no time for tv. I like fishing, it is what me and Dad did in free time back in the day.  People who gave up Cricket after their team lost something were never fans of the game.  Yea. Like today's KKR match, and here I am, browsing reddit. Even two years ago, I would've been hooked to the screen. I havent watched cricket since dhoni won us the world cup I don't even know why Indians like cricket so much. There are other sports as well.  It's not just the IPL. It's cricket as a sport which has become dull and boring for me. As an Indian, I already feel the pride of knowing that my team is (arguably) the best in the world. But can we now move on and set bigger targets more appropriate for the second most populous nation? 

I can't seem to understand why everyone continues to ignore the fact that we are horrible at football, hockey, basketball, tennis and pretty much all major sports that have global participation. Isn't it extremely myopic to ignore our failure in producing world class athletes despite having a population of 1.3 billion, and continuously engage in this 6 nation circle-jerk that contemporary cricket has become?  Hello unkills You watched it for 1 season more then me.  I've lost interest in cricket itself. The last time i watched cricket was the 2011 world cup. Now I think cricket is just a waste of time. Cricket nowadays specially IPL has become like WWE nowadays, totally scripted. Sports is boring,same bullshit getting repeated again and again. Ipl is fixed PSL is the new IPL.

For a student living in Bangalore,

 having a decent mileage( i guess 90-100 kmpl is very good, which i wanted,  but I have little knowledge on bikes)

good engine capacity(like 125-150cc)

the specifications i have written are an approximate requirement. Therefore I am asking help and recommendations from you guys.

I wanted a bike mainly for daily commute, occasional long distance travels(like for tours), etc.",Rajatbhat," Which bike gives 90-100? Damn. Low cc = high mileage
High cc = low mileage 

If u want to add bit of touring go for 150cc bikes as it will fit ur needs and comes with abs as well nowadays. Gixxer, apache, unicorn, hornet, Avenger, pulsar are some options all will give around 45 to 50. None of the bikes will give u 90kmpl. Maybe 100cc patina might but still I'm not sure. Honda CB shine SP, Bajaj Discover 150F, Bajaj Pulsar 135 LS, Bajaj Discover 125, Hero Glamour, Hero MotoCorp Achiever, TVS Star City Plus, TVS Sport, Bajaj Platina, Hero splendour plus, Hero splendour ismart 110, Hero passion Pro i3s, Honda Livo.

I've listed some 100 CC bikes too coz 100cc bikes are the ones which give best mileage.

Platina, TVS Star City, TVS Sport, Passion Pro Splendour ismart or Splendour plus give 80+ mileage in the bikes I've listed above. Bajaj platina is rated at 90kmpl so probably 80kmpl real world. I'd rather go for a scooter and sacrifice some mileage cause as per my experience cheap bikes arnt that great to ride.

Edit: for long rides don't even think of a 100cc bike. I'd say Apache RTR 160 and up is only suitable and nothing below. TVS Radeon Either wait for an electric bike or buy a second hand bike for less. Motorbikes in your budget (100-125cc): TVS Star City, Hero Honda Slendor, Bajaj Platina, etc.  
Scooter in your budget (100-125cc): Honda Activa, TVS Jupiter, etc.   
  
Keep in mind the on-road price adds registration + lifetime road tax + insurance premium + dealer handling charges*. IRDAI changes in Sep 2018 mandates purchase of new 2 wheelers to include a 5 year insurance policy for third party. It's a multi-year policy but added to your on-road cost. I think prices went up ~ Rs 3.2k for bikes upto 150cc.
  
Motorbikes in your budget range which will not be convenient for those occasional long distance travels. Either increase your budget to around 1L for 150-160cc bikes or consider a utility scooter given that you will be driving in Bangalore traffic. I'd pick an Activa for utility instead of Bajaj Platini bike. Ofcourse it's purely a personal preference. Honda Unicorn Look into a preowned unicorn or activa. Search on olx/quikr et al to get an idea of the price. Try and get a 2-3 year old slightly used model. Should set you around 40k all in. Please do invest in a good helmet. Mileage from the activa should hover around 40ish in real city conditions.

Get an activa as the others are mentioning as it is the best mode of travel in the city. Honda Shine SP Electric scooty lele, hostel me charge kar dena. [deleted]",Sports,2019-04-29 15:01:50

On Sundays even Star Gold(the movie channel) is also used for IPL telecasts.

TRAI fucked over the customer when they decided that when you subscribe to a HD channel you don't get its corresponding SD channel for free.  Star sports payed a boatload of money(something like 5k+ crores) to have the exclusive television rights . They will surely milk it as much as possible. They are a  Indian company therefore its expected that they will televise content specifically catering Indian audiences.
I am not surprised that they have only telecast IPL in 8 out of 10 channels. But is F1 being telecast or not? It only starts at 8.30 PM. Even Hungama Tv for kids cartoons are playing ipl. Are people don't give a fuck about it anymore that the network has to Force telecast on every channel which aren't supposed to. As an F1 fan. It sucks.

Today they telecasted like this:


So Star sports 2 - IPL

Select 2 HD - Formula1

Select 2 - Premier League (Liv vs Spurs)

But they didn't telecast qualifier yesterday, I'd to watch it on Hotstar. You can change the language from English to Hindi on the same channel. So don't even need the extra one for Hindi. Just an HD and SD is enough. Cut the cord and get hotstar.   Supply for demand",Sports,2019-03-31 21:13:20

My rant - Lunacy of Indian liberals,27,b5hi6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b5hi6f/my_rant_lunacy_of_indian_liberals/,72,"My rant is solely based on what I read on Twitter, and may not be reflective of all liberals. 

Yes. I am a a liberal and can't stand the divide that Modi's propaganda has created in Indian society. But an opposition of right wing ideology doesn't mean that you end up supporting INC and its policies, which are not completely liberal either.

Their are certain well known (blue tick) handles on Twitter, who have a liberal viewpoint. Few live abroad. I normally agree with their viewpoints, but much to my dismay, some of them seem to support INC, and are happy to see Priyanka join the campaign. Those people have completely forgotten how the nepotism in INC, It's corruption or how it has exploited minorities for its own gain, say Shahbano case.

But this is just the beginning. In their hatred for Modi and his supporters, these handles seem to support or retweet (fundamentalist) Muslim ideology. For anyone who has spent last 30-40 years observing Indian society must have sure seen the gradual shift in ideology of Indian Muslims too. Sudden religious awakening, donning of beard/Hijab (As a kid, never saw a Muslim woman wearing a Hijab). 

Islamophobia in West and India have completely different roots IMO. I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.

TL;DR - how does rejection of Hindutva rationalise support of Islamic fundamentalism? If you are a true liberal, why can't you condemn both kinds of fundamentalism?",baawri_kathputli," [deleted] Can you give some examples of the fundamentalism view points that they agree with? Maybe they are not liberal to begin with. Them calling themselves liberal is only as legitimate as BJP calling themselves the representatives of Hindus As a muslim I'm wondering that this 'rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values' means.


Either way, I'd say the rising Hindutva caused Muslims to move towards a more conservative Islam. The Babri masjid was a culmination of anti muslim efforts that solidified the divide between hindus and muslims. RSS has been hard at work at unifying hinduism and it has done so by othering muslims. no secret there

 Whether you like it or not , we live in a pluralistic society so there is no distinction between Indian values and Islamic values , rather it is a superset of all religious values . Islamic extremism and fundamentalism is now a global problem but you are making things worse by giving counter productive measures which are perceived as Anti Muslim sentiment .  I sport a  beard and am an  Hindu. What's how you look got to do with anything ? Isn't it my choice what I wear/What look I sport ? If anybody is forcing me to do something that's a different matter but what are choices that I made of my own volition got to do with hypocrisy .  The problem with most Muslim Indians is that they r usually from lower middle class where religion plays a heavy role. As people become rich they would start becoming more integrated  Who is supporting Islamic Fundamentalism in opposition to Hindutva? It looks like you've been reading a lot of RW Twitter and it's percolated.

The only difference between your arguments and a generic RW argument is that you've prefaced yours with ""I am a liberal"" with a heavy dose of r/EnlightenedCentrism > Islamophobia in West and India have completely different roots IMO. I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.

Lol no. Even before Independence there was Hindu-Muslim rivalry to the extent that the Muslims wanted a separate country. Most bhakts still bring up Akbar and Aurangzeb and rant about how they destroyed temples and whatnot. 
 > I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.

If you call yourself a liberal after making this bigoted statement that completely whitewashes history, you need to take a long lok at yourself in the mirror.

Hatred of muslims is going on this country for decades. Advani led a stupid ac rath yatra to pull down a archeologically significant mosq in 1992, FFS. What has changed is that the present government has made it easy for bigots to come out of the woodwork and wear their bigotry on their sleeves. I'm totally against Modi but I don't support INC either. To be honest I don't support anyone. I just go to BJP posts and write *Gali gali me shor hain, chowkidar chor hain* to get those Chowkidars offended. And you should stay away from Twitter if you are looking for real political discussions. Reddit is a better place. [removed] What's wrong with donning a beard? 

I think Burqa is wrong and subjugates a women's identity. 

>Islamophobia in West and India have completely different roots IMO. I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.

That's what Ram Mandir is about? Is Ram Mandir an Indian value? 

I think the real big fundamentalism that is a problem is Zakir Naik.

 [removed] The hypocrisy. Wantimg a Hindu Rashtra is not ""anti-Indian"" Wearing a beard is? Fucking bullshit. all major political parties have used religion to favor their agenda , no question about that. BJP is just too good at it , mostly because of their history(RSS). I won't vote for BJP since they are hell bent on destroying the cultural fabric of india , which has been present for 100s of years . if they can't guarantee safety to their citizens(muslims are citizens right?) , what's the point of governance anyways.

&#x200B;

Also one question as a food for thought.

&#x200B;

Muslims have been living in this country for over a 1000 years now , they have every right to claim India as their native land, anybody who believes that Muslims will leave India and go to Pakistan, has basically given up on all reason.

&#x200B;

Once we wake up and understand the above reality. there is only one option , we have to vote for politics which doesn't capitalize on this divide and actively works to cement it for peace and harmony.

&#x200B;

Sadly , I have yet to see such a party in India

&#x200B;

EDIT: Congress was no good either , but atleast in congress government muslims didn't enter hindu houses on filmsy pretexts , and beat up entire family.

&#x200B; I have talked to many muslims , over a period of time  and all of them , agree that the maulvis (religious leader) are the ones behind encouraging fundamentalism , while most of the Muslims don't care much. same is the case with hindus , majority of hindus don't have a real problem with muslims , its just that religious and political leaders on both sides , keep harping on whatever issue they can find.

Which is fantastic, because that should be the purpose of such large format leagues.

ISL started the league in 2014 and this can't be just a random coincidence.

There were championships and leagues before as well, but they were just too marginal or small. It is sad that we need glitz and glam to grow sports, but hey, the good news is that it does work! Brilliant! Wish to see them in World Cup in my lifetime  Is the image copied from the TMNT template? Weird choice leaving the head bands in.

Still, sooooo proud of them üéâ Nice  So proud to witness the rise of Indian Football ! Ordinary citizens won't like a game as long as they don't play it or connect with it themselves. Indians grow while playing cricket and hence develop a liking for the game over time. Football is mostly played in North-eastern parts and West Bengal, but it isn't as mainstream as cricket.

Now to make football a popular sport in the country we should promote the game in the grassroot level first rather than just creating ads which force people to be a fan of the game. Kinda miss Robin Singh on both football and cricket now  All we need is to stand with them as we did with our cricket team make them A STAR too like cricket players.

Tomorrow might be that day :-),846,aaaozr,https://i.redd.it/5njv25kp21721.jpg,88,,nolanfan2," This was posted before start of Day 3's play, after Aus 1st innings total stands at 129 wickets, only 2 away from the record.

*  Bumrah **45** 

* Shami **45**

* Ishant **39**

No. of matches played for each record - 



Trio | Year | Wickets | Matches
---|---|----|----
Garner/holding/marshall| 1984| 130| 15
Bumrah/Shami/Ishant| 2018 | 129| 14

Ambrose/marshall/Walsh| 1988| 118| 11
Morkel/Philander/Steyn| 2012| 108| 10


#EDIT
As some have pointed out, and I agree, that this is in no way proof or indicator that these three are better than the greats mentioned in the list. There are too many variables like home/away split, no. of matches they played together, quality of opposition etc. The thing to emphasize here is that they are 'among the best' and it was something unprecedented from Indian team. I remember the time when Venkatesh Prasad's fast deliveries were slower than Kumble's slow ones.

The current crop have been brilliant. If only our batting line up were a little more consistent overseas, we'd have won more than one Test in each of those series outside of India. If our batting was consistent, we could have won the series in England and Australia.  Is this for when the three of them played together? Or if in one match Umesh was in instead of Shami, for example, would the other two's wickets still add up to the total? Misleading stat. For every other trio they are showing the stats for games all played together, whereas for Indian bowlers their grand totals for the year are taken into account. Bumrah missed first 2 tests in Eng which Shami and Ishant played. For Grand totals Steyn,Ntini,Morkel have 171 in 2008 but they show only 123


Edit: looks it‚Äôs only away for away tests but it‚Äôs not doing justice to other bowlers as their away test matches include not so pacer friendly pitches of subcontinent. 

with Bumrah‚Äôs introduction Indian bowling has definitely improved in tests TBH I'm surprised Jimmy+Broad+Woakes/Stokes/Bresnan/Misc don't feature in the top 5. What about the number of matches played? I hope SENA keeps preparing bowler friendly like they have this season.  Some people are laughing that cricket is followed with such a Zeal in a former colonial state... 

I mean it's one thing to beat them on their own turf, and another abandoning all reason and sports.  Awesome.. but no terror in the heart .. which Holding and company invoked. Bumrah has really shown immense talent n balled on spot Interestingly enough this stat isn‚Äôt showing how many matches they played for those wickets I‚Äôm sure India plays 3 times more test in a year than those guys ever did  Wonderful stat...Bumrah has certainly the potential to become the greatest Indian pace bowler of all time And this is excluding bhuvi's contribution Fuck cricket. [deleted] Wow..  surprisingly there are no Australians  Yeah but back then there was no match fixing. Today all matches are more or less fixed, so can't say that the information or statistics are accurate. Doesn't cricket get enough media attention already? Rather bland content considering this is reddit.
Just my opinion that's all. I don't particularly like or dislike cricket,but I am rather tired of reading about it everywhere.
For instance, recently, we partook in a Hockey world cup and were consequently eliminated in the quarter-finals. All the newspapers I have access to either relegated this news to the last page favouring the test match against Australia over it, or didn't mention it at all. I get that they're trying to sell their papers, albeit I think a full fledged world-cup takes precedence over a run-off-the-mill test match.
We are hasteful to be delighted about our athletes performing well in various sports, albeit when it comes to supporting those very athletes, we turn our backs and cast them a blind eye.
India needs to learn to comprehend and be privy to all of its talent, not just a select few. I find it rather sad, or moreover callous that Sunil Chhetri had to do what he did just to get people to come and watch the national team play ON HOME SOIL. Very very sad indeed.

We don't need to organise any new global sports events.

How to get into sports and related activities after 22?,24,ax8nb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ax8nb8/how_to_get_into_sports_and_related_activities/,42,"I am a 22 year old male and have recently finished college and started a job in IT. Throughout my childhood I have been an introvert, preferred staying inside my room watching movies and stuff. When I got into college, whenever my friends asked me for outdoor games, I always excused myself. I know this was a huge mistake as college gives you platform for learning these stuff. You can call it laziness or shyness or lack of awareness or some other reason that doesn't matter now. Since I have started my job, I have realised the importance of these activities and want to learn them now, but I can't seem to find any place that can help me learn all that at this age. Any help?",mindlessCoder," This post summarised my life are you skinny too?

Coz that's will sum up me. I suggest shooting

Edit: tartget shooting g fuckin marksmanship post. Chutya. Start running.  Mine was totally opposite. Till 18, I played Cricket, Football, Badminton, Table Tennis, Track&Field and Hockey (sometimes) and was into NCC. I was like crazy into sports, followed everything from nba to tennis to badminton to cricket etc etc. They used to air sportscenter on ESPN India @8pm which I would watch with full excitement. I played at district level and a couple of cbse clusters. So I'd say for my entire teen years I liked to play and be outdoors most of the time, going around, riding bicycles and doing shit. Well, sadly life took a 360. I moved to a different town, lost all my school friends plus went out of state for college. At college, all of my interest got lost somehow and done nothing except binge and sleeping. In other words, I turned into an extreme intorverted guy and felt comfortable around myself and started to grow my hair to look cool and headbang a little. Well, there's one thing that helped me by playing different games was fitness. Football and Badminton helped my leg muscles a lot and I think also helped my height ig. I haven't been to a gym ( to this day ) and don't plan to because I never needed to.
23 now btw. Life's been depressed for the last 4 years. I get emotional thinking how cool my teen life was. Now everything is shit. 
Good luck to you.

 I find outdoor activities useless.
Lets say I play cricket. 

While batting , I hit a shot. Some cringy kid shouts ""Oyeee abe shai se bol fek na yaar"". I just stand there and wobble my butt. I waste 30 seconds waiting for another ball.

Some kid does a good fielding while the wicket keeper shouts ""Are chaccha chaccha chacchaaaa chaccchhhaaaa. Oyeeee sahi hai sahi hai sahi haiiiii!""

Batsmen running with their balla and wobbling butt.

Ballers shouting oooyeeee after every ball.

Fielders clapping because there is nothing else to do.

Outdoor activities are super mega cringy for me. I feel like smashing my bat on the face of every player that shouts or claps because he has to do ""something"" and can not stand idle. Starting off is the hardest part. Pick a sport and try to get into it. You should be able to find Badminton, Tennis, Cricket academies fairly easily. Find a sports complex or the kind. Or move to a building with a clubhouse. That'll be a good start. 

I'd recommend gym but typical Indian gyms are filled with steroid junkies and steroid recommending trainers specially when you're skinny.

I have recently started learning Badminton. The fuckers who play well try to fuck with you showing their game off, the best way is to not lose your will to learn and focus on getting as good as them and bearing them. 

I know people who started learning tennis when I played fairly Well and started bearing me in 7-8 months.

There are good technical guides to each sport online. By saying that 22 y/o is too late to start playing is a very lame excuse. Get your lazy ass up and start playing a game in which you have interest. You can start with TT, badminton etc.

I am assuming you don't go to gym so you can start focusing on your physique by joining a gym, first few weeks would be tough but once you get past it then it will get easier.

But seriously dude, GET YOUR LAZY ASS TO WORK Try Playo app.. The more you play the quickly you learn... Also, you can play Squash.. It is one of the few games which you can learn playing solo...  OP, first of all why do you want to get into sports? You say you have realized it is important. I don't deny the benefits, but what is your end goal?

Is it something specific like playing at a professional level or just something to keep you active and engaged?

If it is the latter, learn like how a child would. Just by playing it for fun. Find some of your colleagues who'd go for playing sports and ask them to tag you along for a game. Regularly do that. You will not only learn the sport gradually, but you'll have fun doing it as well. Not to mention that it will vastly improve your social circle.  Really depends on where you're from but there's always coaching centers for most sports. No age is too late to join these classes. My uncle started Table Tennis coaching at 40 years age and now he's addicted to it. You gotta spend money but that money is definitely worth it in the long run. What do u like to do most? If u like cricket, hang out near cricket grounds and start talking to them. They can always use an extra player. Same with any other sports. 

If u don't ask, u wont get it. Start making progress little by little. 22 is still young to give up.  Bowling. It is really fun.   Advice from 29 year old guy:

- Smoked from 18 years to 28 years. realised its a huge mistake and here is how I got into active sports.

- stopped smoking cold turkey.

- Started running, small distances and sprints. progressed and completed Two Half Marathons.
- Bought bike(cycle) and along with running, ride 25-50 kms. If you can't bike daily, then on weekend ride 30-50kms. It looks daunting but your legs will get used to it.
- Start Badminton.
- Start Swimming.

Schedule:

- 2-3 times running
- 1-2 times Badminton
- 1-2 times Bike
- 1-2 times swimming

Now start looking into Marathons/Dualthon/Traithlon. Forget social media and open account in starva, follow people and sync your activities there.

If at 29 years I could do it, you are just 22 and can definitely do it. 

Good luck.  Honestly it'll be very tough for you to get into a sport at this age. I assume you'd want to play with people your age cause it'll be weird for you to play with school kids right. Unfortunately most people your age would be those who actively enjoy the sport and have been playing for many years. They'll be way better than a noob and you won't be able to develop your skills to a good enough level to enjoy playing with them.",Sports,2019-03-04 23:58:26

Anushka: ""mm, its nice but next time I wanna go to my favorite Italian restaurant.""

Kohli: ""I don't think you should live in India. Go and live in Italy. Why are you living in our country and loving other countries? I don't mind you not liking my food but I don't think you should live in our country and like other's thing. Get your priorities sorted.""   His inner bhakt surfaces. Khud shaadi baahar ja kar ki thi, wahi reh jaaye.

Not that I think like that, but I am applying his argument to him. This leave if you don't like something argument is pure retarted. Why is this argument so popular? I don't like foreign batsmen nor Indian ones, but if you are paying for my tickets and visa then I'll say that I like foreign batsmen more than Indians. Get me moving now! BTW I like New Zealand batsmen better just so you know where to send me. Fortunately that fan didn't say that he likes to see Pakistani batsmen in action. Otherwise he would have celebrated this Diwali in Pakistan. Nice political play there kohli. Polarize first! Address the issue later. How I wish this was fake. Is bhenchod ke liye jo zaraa sa  respect tha, woh bhi nahi rahega bahut jald. At least sehwag showed his colours *after* his career over, yeh to abhi shuru ho gaya.  This is a statement of inadequacy from a batsman who has it all to become a legend of the game  Sir but i have a Aadhaar card. 'Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel' By his logic he should - Sponsor only indian brands, leave India if you sponsor uber, nike, nestle, puma. Set your priorities right Virat. Ponting was my favourite batsman, Sachin was third most favourite, Dada being second.  kek! help me with visa, travel and settling in the new land. Although I like indian batsmen but I am ready to settle abroad. This comment section, twitter outrage shows why India will never have any show like Colbert, Bill Maher, John Oliver or any political comedy show. It you read the article it says he was responding to mean comments, like ""mean tweets"". If you think he would risk millions of $s of contracts, you need to think again. His response was really bad, the response should be 5-6 words max and shouldn't need to be explained. I feel like that comment might be fake, it sounds very condescending, ""these Indians"" I mean WTF. Also don't think anyone would describe Kohli as ""overrated batsman. Nothing seems special in his batting."" Kohli is the one of the few batsmen that is succeeding at all format.  Seemed kinda like those Jimmy kimmel mean tweet  thing people really need to loosen up these days.kohli isn‚Äôt known for his wit seemed like a poor joke nothing more nothing less. Top meme material right here. Cricketers shouldn't even joke these days because people will find some reason to get offended. This too with Kohli whose favorite batsman is probably ABD. Looks like most ppl didn't even watch the video to get the context. No wonder media can polarise people with their headlines. Its deeply upsetting.This is why we can't have nice things. Have hordes of ultra regressive conservative people in the country is bad enough. Just wake up and understand the context before you get all hyper and start hating the guy who is most likely more liberal than you. Idiots.. Comment taken out of context. 

Could have handled it better, yes. But it is not that big a deal it is made out to be. I hate it when people who have never watched sports in their lives start talking shit about players because of a random misinformed bias. He said in mockering way. He is kind of person who replies with BC to his bully while hugs to his friend. The questioner asked cringy question and the inner Delhi boi of kohli activated. That's it. Nothing else to discuss. This is ridiculously poor by Kohli. I thought Kohli of 2018 had matured in to a sensible stand up guy.  Any sport transcends nationalities and it's perfectly alright to have idols from other nationalities. How many kids growing up had their idols as Gilchrist, ABD, Sachin, Shane Warne, Mcgrath etc. That has nothing to do with nationality. Just shows is Kohli's mentality in a very poor light. This guy is such a dumb snobby arrogant bhakt! He thought Demonetization was the greatest political move ever.

Now he is asking people to leave India. This guy will be the CM of UP after fake Yogi becomes PM.


> ""For me, it's the greatest move that I've seen in the history of Indian politics, by far. I've been so impressed by it, it's unbelievable what has happened,"" Kohli said at the pre-match press conference.

I think this was his brainfade moment. Unsure about the authenticity of the video. If it's real though, I find it hilarious he said that, especially since he didn't get married in India. Same logic hold true, no? Kohli's chaddi is showing.

Next, [removing high protein food like beef from the cricketer's menu](https://newsd.in/bcci-asks-cricket-australia-to-remove-beef-from-indias-menu/).

And now naming non-supporters as anti-Indians.

RSS wants to use the soft power of cricket to influence millions of Indians to abhor people who eat beef or non-supporters as anti-Indians, further creating divisive lines in our country and to push their own communal agenda.

I won't be surprised if in future Muslim players like Shami and Khaleel Ahmed get dropped from the Indian Cricket Team all Indians should leave India The beauty of any sports is the fact it transcends all barriers and binds people together in a common thread. Jingoism should have no place in it. I am a Virat Kohli fan because of his hard work and attitude but this shit is ridiculous.  I don't like any batsman,  i just hate virat koli. Does this mean i can stay?  I remember him using a stool to stand next to a tall female sportsperson. While undoubtedly a brilliant cricketer, not the brightest of bulbs otherwise.

We‚Äôd do better as a race if we follow people who are actually serving society than being insanely good at hitting a ball. I wonder what he has to say about the thousands of desi expat fans who come to see him and the Indian team play in the UK/Australia/other countries. Haha... Kohli should watch mean tweets. The Vedas say that all true Indians should believe India is the best at everything. Those who don't should go to Pakistan. I like lara more than anyone , I like Denis lily as bowler than anyone else.
 [Very relevant.](http://imgur.com/gallery/uwMGKtk) Lol reactions here are over the top to something taken out of context. I always wonder with guys like this if they believe that Indians still cheering for Indian sportsmen/women while living in America should come back to India? I am shocked and mind-blown that a progressive intellectual like Kohli has said this. Pfft. Fucking wanker. Intellect inversely proportional to batting skills....Indians have the habit of making gods of celebs, and to an extent then some will even try to justify their stupid remarks. Lol. Kiddo got offended  Why all of sudden he sounds like a BJP person ? He recently tweeted about his partnership with Tissot and he is their brand ambassador. Someone should tell him that if he prefers a foreign brand over Ajanta watches then he should leave India The country's been bhakt-up.  What else did you all expect from a modi fan.

So after Sehwag and Dhoni, Kohli preparing for a BJP ticket too? This man still doesn't have 'control over his mouth' at the big age of 30 sadly.

Virat Kohli, you Sir are an idiot. He is becoming too arrogant ,if this is his statement Taken out of context, the 'Fan' pretty much called the Greatest Batsman at the moment overrated and then said that he'd rather watch Australians or English than 'these' Indians. Lol, definitely deserved what he got as a reply.  Kohli only says this because he knows Smith is the true test chad Ok. Deal. Give me money to emigrate and i'm off to Australia for life. Tere baap ka hai kya india? chutiye Leave India if you like foreign wedding venues more than Indian ones.

Chutiya. His tone sounds very different in text and in video, but nevertheless that's a very stupid thing to say. Thought his PR team would have told him to handle it better and say the right things. Where cricket is the definition of patriotism.  One thing we need to learn is that good actors/artists/authors/sportsmen can be absolute rubbish humam beings. And it's fine. They don't owe anyone anything. They should be known for their craft and that's that.  I really live him as a cricketer, he has actually worked very hard and used his natural talent to be at zenith of the cricket. But this is an absolute rubbish reaction, you should only like Indian things otherwise you should leave the country!! Really who choose a foreign country for his marriage celebration, has sponsorship deals with multiple foreign brands like Puma, Audi, Tissot, Col-Pal more. üò∂ Never liked him and his smugface. And, I love Cricket. The most shameful disgustingly highest run scorer who has shitty personality in India as a sportsman. Infact he is no sportsman at all.  Virat Kohli for all his glories as a batsman is a short tampered goon.

I don't like him at all. He is by far the worst person to be a captain of any team. It is clearly evedent that how he is a proper failure WITH RCB when he doesn't get the same guidance on how to run a team.  Waah. Those who endorse foreign brands like puma and oppo should leave also Replace"" batsmen"" with ""pornstars"" and read again.  Ah, I was wondering when the ""Delhi"" in him would start to show. About time.  What an utterly douchenozzley response from Kohli. Don't know what the guy he responded to meant by 'these Indians' though.  Virat Kohli : [*""Demonetisation is greatest move in history of Indian politics, says Virat Kohli""*](https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/demonetisation-is-greatest-ever-move-in-history-of-indian-politics-virat-kohli-4378322/) Batsmen outside, chutiya inside.  I don't think he meant that as is. Even I was slightly irked by that person's choice of words - as if he was trying to irritate Kohli deliberately. Notice that the person used words like English, Australian, rather than pointing out what actually they found in them other country players that ""Indian"" players were lacking,rather than them being Indian. 

Although Virat could've answered more clearly, I don't think it's his fault that he replied in such a manner.  Cricket is a pathetic, boring colonial game and such cringe does not help its case.

Someone needs to stop this overhyped crap sport from discrediting potential for other sports in this country already. He can go fuck himself.  Again this retard with his verbal diarrhea.  I think this is just a knee jerk reaction to criticism from a sportsman who has dedicated his life to the game. No one expects a leader of the sport to say something like this, but maybe just Kohli's immaturity in handling unexpected statements. Hopefully, he can work on it and improve. I liked this guy though i dont follow cricket anymore. Didnt know Kohli was a first grade cunt. Dilli ka chhora hai. Mean comments ko pyaar se reply nahi karega. Responding sledging with sledging. Videshi cricketers know it very well, now indian critics too.

Proud of you Kohli! Feels like most people don't get sarcasm nor do they have a sense of humour. Cricketers who have a political opinion like Kolhi, Sehwag, Gambhir should be arrested.  What does ""these Indians"" mean  Get a batting average like Don Bradman. Then tell other Indians to leave India I don't even like cricket. I think it's stupid. What should I do?

I love how he reads a comment on the internet and thinks that he should now weigh in as to what the person should do with his life. 

It wasn't even that bad a comment. Looks like we have a snowflake here. 

&#x200B;

Edit: Afterthought So, it comes to pass: After the politicians, babas and VCs, an entertainer is educating Indians about this 'art of nationalism'. I don't even watch or have slight interest in cricket. Where should I go ü§î Anushke "" Leave me if you jerk off to Sunny Leone"" Shaadi kahe India me  ahi ki fir? [deleted] Never ever feed a troll. Only a troll would call Kohli overrated. And ""these Indians‚Äù, what's that supposed to mean. He is a passionate Indian cricketer, 
 who got pissed and reacted in anger, so what? So narrow this guy is, Indians should like him but his fans can't kiss him.

Saava sou karod between the edges...
Thoda aadjeyst karlo bhai! Fuck this guy....why can't you admire and like another batsman even if you live and are an Indian.   It's a game you chutia not a war your a sports person not a soldier, you my man have issues.   

Ja Anushka ka loda chuss to shayad koi buddi ayegi.... fuckwad. Bharat Ratna for Kohli is now confirmed Any other source on this? Next time if any organisation thinks to make kohli an ambassador of a noble cause it should think hundreds of time. Sports are always considered containing some force of unity or togetherness. It follows that representative of a sport should never be unmindful of his duties. By advocating popular and rabid form of nationalism kohli has done huge disservice.
P.S. Now we should not expect from cricket to heal our relationship with a certain neighbour. ""He is overated"" This statement is enough to prove that his comment is worth ignoring. No need to respond",Sports,2018-11-07 17:12:28

On Friday, it emerged that India's star shuttler had signed a new multi-crore deal with popular Chinese sports brand Li Ning. The four-year deal announced on Friday will fetch Sindhu Rs 50 crore according to Mahendra Kapoor, director, Sunlight Sports Pvt Ltd, the multi-national exclusive partner of Li Ning in India.

>""We are happy to be associated with Sindhu once again. The four-year deal will be close to Rs 50 crore. Sindhu will get Rs 40 crore as sponsorship while the rest will be for equipment, so it is close to Rs 50 crore,"" Kapoor told ToI and added that they are looking forward to a long term association with Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth.

>Sindhu is the only Indian shuttler to win an Olympic silver and World championships silver.

"Betting / Gambling is taken as a serious issue in India, then how come Cricketers are promoting apps like Dream11 when it's based on money? Just another way of Betting / Gambling correct?",23,b66hl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b66hl0/betting_gambling_is_taken_as_a_serious_issue_in/,16,,neilupinto," Betting is not legal in India (depending on the type of betting and place, again), but fantasy sports is legal.

As per Sec 12 of Public Gambling Act of India, ""skill based games are not covered under gambling in India"".

Hence games like fantasy cricket/sports and rummy for that reason, come under ""skill based games"" hence out of the purview of gambling.

While lottery, betting on sports (not fantasy sports), and other card games like flush etc come under betting.  There was a case againt dream11 and they won. Google it. Skill games - No ban, but again the decision is taken by the state law.

Dream11 & Online Rummy - does not falls under gambling as these games requires skills to play.

Though few states like - Telangana, kerala, assam, nagaland & orissa banned all the games where money is involved.

Supreme court gave rule rummy as game of skill but few states banned it. Although site owners are fighting for this but no result yet. Gambling law in India is a bit complicated. For something to be gambling you generally need the following components:

1. Uncertain event - you don't know what the outcome will be.
2. Consideration - you're paying something to participate. 
3. Prize - you are competing or participating for a prize.

You need all three elements. Zynga poker is not prohibited because there is no prize (under Indian law). 

Generally, games of skill are not treated as gambling. Different states have imposed different standards. Telangana took the position that ANY element of chance would make it a game of chance. West Bengal on the other hand, treats poker as a game of skill. This boils down to whether a game is preponderantly that of skill or chance. 

The Supreme Court has some cases in which they decided whether some games are gambling. 

1. Horse race betting - game of skill - people can research conditions of horse, skill of jockey, etc. That takes skill. 

2. Rummy - game of skill - can learn card combinations, etc

3. Poker (Gujarat HC) - game of chance - no skill involved and poker is preponderantly a game of chance. (Lol)

Basically a lot of things are uncertain until a court decides if a game is predominantly that of skill or chance. 

 It depends on region to region. That's what I have seen  They'll do anything for money. There's no surprise there. If the company gets caught doing something illegal, the most these cricketers/actors say is, ""sorry, I was not aware of this"".

The show that I really wanted to watch is 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia' but I heard that Hotstar was self censoring their contents and that would take all the fun away from 'Always Sunny' since it's quite crass. That's one of the reasons why I like the show.

So should I spend my ‚Çπ1,000 on an annual subscription or just do the diddly-doo to watch?",refreshnamesuggested," That's 80 bucks per month. I'm sure you can afford that. If you still want to pirate content when there are cheap alternatives available, that's left to you. Do it. More people we get on legal way of watching things, more things will get to see. Also, feels good to give back to your favourite actors/director/producers.  I'm not sure about the censorship but I'd definitely get it for the sports itself, they have almost all the sports minus wwe and champions League football. Everything else is on it. Sometimes i wonder that myself, I took their one year sports pack to watch the IPL last year and I haven't used it again since... If you are paying it for HBO originals then its fine. I cancelled mine after 2 years because of how horrible their sports streaming were especially premier league. I had a lot of problems with any Man u and Arsenal matches. 

I wouldn't recommend it for streaming sports.  don't know much about the shows but their sports plan @299 is totally worth it ( I got it when they were giving 200rs cashback if paid by paytm) Hey guys, Im a hotstar premium subscriber... But I‚Äôm not able to stream GOT in 1080p on my iphone. It‚Äôs maxed out to 720p. Does anybody face this problem?  Yes. For the serials. Not a sports viewer. Good serials and it streams well most of the time.

The Apple TV app though is pure shit.  I think it's absolutely worth it if you like TV shows.

 It has great shows not available elsewhere like sopranos, the wire, band of brothers, silicon valley, the shield, deadwood, twin peaks, justified, plus nearly every popular sitcom.

Although yeah iasip is censored and it does spoil the jokes frequently, like in the pilot they cut out the entire closing scene. 

I've had it for several years and I think it's worth the money. I use it for premier league, I paid 200 for a year. In US they recently had a promo for 10$ for a year..!  It's definitely worth the yearly premium subscription money. It has a lot of good TV shows and movies and so much sports content. The other good thing about it is that all the Disney Plus Originals would be made available on Hotstar in India and that makes it too good a deal to say no to.

But if they are involved I'm sure they're in it for the ‚Çπ‚Çπ. To eventually own the league formats and take it the cricket board route which is super rich. And so it's in their best interests to not fuck up selection and support it from the ground up. In what ways would they fuck it up? Private body involvement in cricket, hockey, kabbadi have yielded great results. Yeah it's not the traditional 'club' format just a show of such traditions but so what? Not defending Reliance, but i have seen first hand that reliance works/supports at grass-root level in football. My neighbour‚Äôs son in 6th standard got picked by reliance academy. Reliance moved him to mumbai, boarding/lodging/schooling and international level training absolutely free of cost. Last i heard, kids were being taken to London for EPL youth academy exposure. If a completly middle class KV schooled kid is being trained for future prospect, I think we should give atleast some credit to Reliance for it. Reliance/Motabhai has a say in *everything* in this country. Ambanis are the Lannisters. if reliance is involved then their end target is profit, profit which will come if the team performs . We all know the shabby football infrastructure from selection bias to corruption.

Meanwhile, my cousins and friends who did not listen continued working on sports are now getting into prestigious international colleges due to sports quotas. Another one of my friend is now a respected chef in Dublin. They are living much more exciting and fulfilling life than me, will probably be more successful than me and definitely much more happier.

Fellow randians, how many of you really regret listening to your parent's advice. Had to write it because I had to vent my anger out somewhere.",0means," I believe everything thing that happened in my life till now is my fault and everything will be. If they said something that I think is wrong then it is my fault that I listened to them and didn't do what I feel was right. It gives you comfort that it was my fault and I wasn't helpless that I was just foolish and I can learn from my mistakes. But it doesn't mean that for every mistake you have to feel bad about it. Humans make mistake. Believe that you did your best in those circumstances and if not then you will learn from these mistakes and not repeat them. Cheers!  No. I wanted to study literature. They gave me freedom to pursue whatever I wanted to. But I don't have any motivational story to share. Following your passion doesn't ensure success. I failed to replicate those 'I followed my passion' success stories. To be frank, now I resent my so called passion. Seems your problem is constantly comparing yourself with others instead of being content in your life. Nothing is set in stone. You can still change things about your life. First of all what exactly is so miserable in your life? Parents guide us based on their experiences of life .Moreover in India , children are social securities in an indirect way.



Don't crib . Move on . And you can restart tennis . 
 What I do is just listen to their suggestions and wait until the right moment has come to tell them what I am actually going to do!

They call me ""ghaag"" for this behavior. According to them, ghaag is a person who is always consumed in self-thoughts and do not tell anyone what is he/she going to do and never listen to anyone. 

They get mad at me, but in the end, when they see me happy with my decisions, it's all good for them.

I also listen to only myself because in a case in the future if I fuck up with my life, I, by any means cannot blame my parents or anyone because all the fucking decisions were mine. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B; Until this point, you have tried what your parents told you, only because you were not passionate enough about whatever you liked.  

There is no reason for me to think you showed so much promise in Tennis that you would have done fabulously (you have not really told me about the medals you won in your engg college sports activities, or in other external sports championships). 

You knew your parents for 18 yrs. They maybe experts in engg, or they maybe farmers...but basically their advice was given based on their experiences and the best advice they got. If you didnt show enough 'ability' in tennis - how the heck will they know .. you are gifted in tennis ??

It is easy to sift all the blame onto your parents for it all, but, that will only allow you to blame them for all your future choices too. Maybe it is time to figure out what exactly you want to do with your life and what you are good at and do something. 

&#x200B; Parents advise you based on their experience. I don't think their intention was wrong. Tennis and sports actually didn't pay well at last decade or so, you have had to struggle for proper equipment let alone earninh well. I feel it should have been you who should have pushed harder and changed their mindset and showed them that there is potential. Also I guess you are in your early 20s, nothing is stopping you from pursuing something more interesting pehle main karta tha. lekin ab nahin. Now I want me and my future wife to raise my child if I have one to be independent and think for himself. sunne mein to aasaan lag raha hai but bahot mushkil hone wala hai Hmm. My parents fucked up my shit real good. And I still blame them for it. 


I'm not bitter about it, I mean they didnt fuck my shit up because they wanted to fuck me up. Really just the opposite. They just didnt know any better.


It doesnt change the fact that my shit is good as fucked, for life no less. But I'm done being bitter about it. 


I'm sure you're angry rn. I'm just saying your anger is valid. Don't take it out on them if you think their actions were motivated out of love and concern. But dont need to stop venting your frustration with friends, online or even to a sympathetic ear. 

My parents saw shitty times where they would collect melt wax and make new candles, to save money. Your parents probably did too. You cant blame them for being aspirationally conservative. Aspirations were a dangerous thing to have back then.

Another technique that I remember they used in fiitjee was repeating tapes of inorganic chemistry as whitenoise while sleeping so that it registers in the subconscious mind. Bihar's school of yoga has some books regarding this, i can't remember. Just google yoga nidra book, has plenty of whacky sleep experiments. If you understand concept then make mindmaps i.e. take important words or formulas or any small definations and structure them neatly. Revise it in your free time for 3-4 days. After that Revise the whole thing again and I am sure you will get it. write down everything after memorizing Revision is the only way to do it. Revise as much as you can. Also practice if it's problem solving.  1. [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)

Mind maps + pictorial representation(if possible) works best for me along with spaced repition .  Spaced repetition and regular tests. If you want to learn more, see Robert Brown's Make It Stick.  The night before the exam should be for revision. Don‚Äôt leave any topics to be started then. 

Ideally you should be revising for the second time the night before you go.  what's Randia? draink brain power 2000 everyday.",Sports,2019-02-09 13:52:28

**Current Medal Tally**

India's medal tally as of now: 15 Gold, 24 Silver, 30 Bronze.

India is currently at the 8th position in [the medal table](https://m.sportskeeda.com/sports/asian-games-medals-table).

**Note**: Regular updates and schedule in the comments. 

**The Games have ended!**",snicker33," Update - Hockey: India wins Men's Hockey Pool A Prelims, beating Hong Kong by 26-0. WTF?! Update - Gymnastics: Dipa Karmakar qualifies for the final of the beam event. Apparently, Iranian women's Kabaddi coach is from India and wanted to coach the Indian team but never got the opportunity. She then decided to accept the Iranian offer to prove her mettle. Hi all,

To those not aware one of the reasons for India's better showings at Asian Games,CWG and Olympics is due to several previous sportsmen like Geet Sethi, Prakash Padukone, Pulella Gopichand and Rahul Dravid and their foundations [Olympic Gold Quest](https://www.olympicgoldquest.in/) and [GoSports](http://www.gosportsfoundation.in/) who support several players like Duttee Chand, Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, Swapna Barman and many more. You can check their websites for more information.

If you would like to donate to any of these you can do at [Gosports](http://www.gosportsfoundation.in/donate_now.php) and [Olympic Gold Quest](https://www.olympicgoldquest.in/donate-now.php) Not relevant but India got a bronze in eSports! Hima Das is absolute beast.  Neeraj Chopra has won the gold !!!! What an athlete.  Four valid throws and all well above 80m. The fact that his least throw was better than silver medalist's best is a testimony of how good the guy is.  8 gold medals denied to India by Bahrain+Qatar. 1 Gold denied to China.
If there were no Bahrain+Qatar.
India would have 15 Golds to China's 13 and be number 1 in athletics in Asia. Quite a feat by our athletics team. Holy fack!! 88.06m at the age of 20. Neeraj Chopra, what a guy. So that concludes the athletics events at 2018 Asian Games. What a superb performance by Indian athletics contingent winning 19 medals(7 gold, 10 silver amd 2 bronze). Update - Swimming: Virdhawal Khade finishes 4th in Men's 50m Freestyle Final clocking 22.47s. 

Missed Bronze by 0.01 seconds! Update: India's women Kabaddi team finishes on top of table, qualifies for semi-finals.  Update - Tennis: Rohan Bopanna and Sharan Divij enter semis, assure another medal for India

 Deepika kumari has been disappointing on every big ticket event. She goes into tournaments as world number 1 and  does really bad. The federation really needs to get her a mental conditioning coach asap. Sindhu is in the final !! I feel Bahain/Qatar's poaching of athletes only action will be taken when it starts to affect the US/UK and Jamaica in the Olympics. Update - Shooting: Rahi Sarnobat bags **Gold** in WOmen's 25m Pistol Final.  Men and women both lose to Iran in kabadi.
Great rivalry coming up for years to come.  Tajinderpal Singh Toor has won the gold medal in men's shot put. His best throw was of 20.75 m , which is also a new Asian Games record. Great work by him. Hopefully we will get more medal from athletics in the coming days. 3 gold medals in running denied because of Bahrain/Qatar buying off athletes. Out of a total of 7 medal events in Athletics in which Indian athletes were participating today, they won medals in four events (1 gold and 3 silver). Quite an impressing performance indeed. Damn Neeraj Chopra's score is good enough for an Olympic medal Update: Indian Men's Kabaddi Team beats Thailand with a score of 49-30, make their way into semi-finals.  Events in which India can win medal on Day 5 (23/08/2018):

17. Tennis - Women's Singles
18. Weightlifting - Men's 77kg [removed] Rohan Bopanna and Divij Sharan wins gold in Tennis Men's Doubles. I feel that if we consider the ""original"" Asians, the Indian athletes clearly dominate a lot of events.  The men's table tennis team have qualified for the semi-finals beating Japan by 3-1, also ensuring a medal in the process Pakistan has some grandpa playing against Achanta in TT Hima Das, you absolute beauty. 30m lead was way too much for the Africans to cover. Hockey and kabaddi both have been massively disappointing. Neeraj chopra taught himself the art of throwing a javelin by watching YouTube , reason why his throwing looks unconventional.  Later he had become world class under great coaches   Sindhu's biopic should be called Silver. Is Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore the first sports minister who is a former sportsperson ? Bc Asian record kyo keh rahe ho, call it African records. Events in which India can win medal on Day 13(31/08/2018):

A bronze at last. Yet India wasn't at full potential. Pakistan was breathing down our neck! Not a comprehensive win and lots to improve before world cup. But man, Harmanpreet is proving to be a great great player!  Narendar Grewal wins bronze in men's sanda 65kg. [Asian Games 2018: Indian rowers claim gold in quadruple sculls](https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/asian-games-2018-indian-rowers-claim-gold-in-quadruple-sculls/article24767931.ece?homepage=true) Compound Men Archery's team now in the finals. \^\_\^   


Except the last shot, Rajat Chauhan scored all 10's. We needed a 7 in the last one, he scored a comfortable 9. Great going, will surely catch the finals! We've got 4 medals in Athetics till now with 1 gold and 3 silver. That's an amazing achievement. There's still Neeraj Chopra. Hopefully he'll be able to get a gold for us.  88.06 Damn! Neeraj Chopra is the answer for decades long old wait for Olympic gold in athletics. We have lost the men's table tennis team semifinal to Korea. One more bronze for India. Good performance by Indian team to reach till the semis.  India are currently third in the medals tally for athletics. Only behind Bahrain and China. And already got more golds than in 2014. And maybe more medals to come. Very impressive. Gold in Heptathlon. Wow. Hopefully the women's hockey team will win the gold, thus helping us to reach 7th position in the medal tally.  Boria majumdar is hyperactive guy... zyada hi excited rehta hai... India women team win squash semis against fav malaysia... Now on to finals...good job deepika/chinappa... win a Gold Fck! Another gold in Bridge!! I'm dreaming? Best tally ever in all respects ü§ôüèæü§ôüèæ We can best hope for a bronze now from Ind vs Pak field hockey match. So we finally end our Asian Games campaign at 69 medals(highest ever) with 15 gold(equal to our highest ever), 24 silver(highest ever) and 30 bronze medals. Update - Tennis: Rohan Bopanna and Ankita Raina beat South Korea's Kim Nari and Jeamoon Lee in Mixed Doubles, make their way to quarter-finals.  Update - Wrestling: Divya Kakran has won the **Bronze Medal** in Women's Freestyle 96kg, beating Taipei's Chen Wenling by 10-0! 

 u/snicker33 good job with the updates.
Thanks  Update - Tennis: Medal confirmed for India as Ankita Raina wins quarterfinals in straight sets, clinches match 6-4 6-1. Heena Sidhu wins bronze in Women's 10m air pistol. Piss-poor performance by India's archery team and the weightlifting contingent. Also very disappointed by India's top male badminton players not being able to put up a decent performance. 

It's easier to win at Commonwealth Games where the competition isn't so severe but if you harbour dreams of winning a medal at the Olympics then you ought to win at the Asian Games at the least!

 Nirmla has also qualified alongside Hima Das for the final of Women's 400m. India: Korea :: 4:1.
Really good performance by our girls! Last quarter was a delight!  Hima Das wins silver. Gold lady was just too good. :/ Archery should have more points other than 10,9,8 system. Points in decimal as well for more accuracy.  As noone else seems to be doing it congrats to Sindhu for the silver, best ever achievement by an Indian badminton player at Asian games. Hima Das disqualified for False Start. Wtf, it's a nightmare!!  India has been truly robbed of 3 gold medals from the Bahrain brought athletes. 1st the 100m gold, then 400m and the 4x400m mixed relay. They aren't even indigenous Asians.  11 medals in athletics so far and none of them is a bronze. This says a lot about the performance of Indian athletics contingent. The have been very confident and have given their 100 percent in every event.  The gold and silver in men's 800m was miraculous and so was the silver in mixed relay.

Archery also ended on a positive note for India as we managed 2 silver medals.

Sindhu's silver was a historic moment. Waiting for her to bring gold very soon.

History was also created in Table Tennis as the bronze in men's team event was India's FIRST EVER medal of any kind in table tennis.

Kurash came as the surprise package of the day with India winning a silver and bronze in it. Getting a medal in an event dominated heavily by Uzbeks is no mean feat. Hopefully these medals will help in popularising this sport in the country.

‚Äã Man manjit singh! What a champ!! Did anyone see that heat? Expecting a gold from Seema Punia. Hopefully she repeats her performance from the last edition.  Is it just me or scoring in boxing seems way too suspicious and shady? Jinson Johnson wins gold, to go with his silver in 800m. Manjit ends fourth, started sprinting thoda late. India have overtaken their 2014 medal tally, both in terms of gold and no. of medals (:  Commentators constantly calling the Bahrain athletes as Ethiopian and Kenyan athletes üòÇ Damn what a run,Bahrain I think had 3 gold medallists,Hima Das's greatest moment so far at senior level. If we get 2 more gold medals then we will equal our record of maximum gold medals which was set in the first ever Asian Games in Delhi, 1951. Bros, sorry for this interjection. Seeing the number of sports fans here, can we please have a separate indian subreddit for sports?

I fear it may be flooded with Cricket. Assuming a few fans here would be interested, how to go about it? Our current tally of 23 silver medals is the most number of silver medals we have ever got in Asian Games. The second best is 19 silver medals in 1982 Delhi Asian Games. We  have reached 1000 comments  in this thread  one more record today So that's it? We end on 69? Bahrain and Qatar are participating in the wrong continental games.

Should be in the African one. Though find it amusing their athletes don't even murmur the national anthem üòÇ Update - Swimming: Indian team qualifies for men‚Äôs 4x100m freestyle relay Final.  Update - Wrestling: India‚Äôs Harpreet Singh wins his bout against Heageun Park of Korea 4-1. He now enters the quarters.

 PV Sindhu enters quarterfinal by beating Indonesia's Tunjung GM by two games to nil. A huge upset in Squash as Goshal, the top seed is defeated. Very disappointing. 

Not much hope in Athetics other than Mohammed Anas, Dutee Chand and Neeraj Chopra.

I think we will fall woefully shot of gold medals this time and even overall medal when compared to 2014. Hima Das has qualified for women's 400m final. Indian team has won silver in Equestrian Eventing Team. The Indian team consisted of  Rakesh Kumar, Ashish Malik, Jitender Singh and Fouaad Mirza. Saina Nehwal is into the semifinal of women's singles after defeating Ratchanok Intanon. Sony needs to get better commentators (the analysts are ok I guess)  ,these seem of the old Doordarshan quality,not expecting them to have in depth knowledge but should know at least the basic rules  /nuances of games India are good in,during archery the commentator thought games was over after 21 out of 24 shots,despite Korea clearly keeping on shooting,a few days back he was screaming how an Indian wrestler was amazing in his defence in last few minutes as he won the last point only for the referee to raise the opponents hand(didn‚Äôt stop him screaming though),another one assured us of a medal for reaching the sf (he went on to lose the repechage),boxing guy has no confidence to say who is winning though I guess he honestly doesn‚Äôt make an attempt . We won two Silver medals in Equestrian - one for a team event and another an individual one.

Not too many people follow the sport but it's a great a achievement nonetheless. India vs S.Korea in both Men's & Women's compound archery team final Dutee Chand silver ,lost by 0.02s Goving Lakshmanan who earlier won the bronze in 10000 m race has been disqualified because his foot touched inside the race track. Gonna be a very tough fight for both Saina and Sindhu. Sania has to gave the world number 1 and Sindhu has to play the world number 2. It's not gonna be easy! 

If the two end up beating their opponent, then it's richly deserving.

I have a feeling that Saina may do better than Sindhu. But let's hope both these wonderful women win.  A lot of athletics action is coming up from 5:10 PM. Also the quarterfinals of men's and women' team in table tennis. Dharun Ayyasamy has won the silver in men's 400m hurdles. Excellent run by him, especially in the last 50m to rob the Japanese of the silver. Sudha Singh has won the silver in women's 3000m steeplechase. She won the gold in the same event in 2014 Asian Games.  Neeraj Chopra, my man. Silver for India in women's compound archery team event after losing to South Korea in the final. 

Final score : Korea: 231 India: 228

Muskan Kirar and Madhumita Kumari failed to get their best shots as the match progressed. Although excellent shooting by Jyothi Surekha Vennam. Archery: Most bizarre rules I've ever seen. But they tried their best.  So so many Bahrain-Qatar wins in tracks. Asia doesn't even have that 5 year IOA rule. Fuck them. There was a guy who has his brother playing for Nigeria. Just read about Tejinder Pal Singh shot put gold winner . He switched from cricket to shot put. Cannot imagine that dude playing cricket now with that physique. Hima Das almost caused another disqualification with that obstruction. At this point might just call them Afro-Asian Games. The Chinese boxer was all over Vikas. But Vikas won the bout. Dutee Chand, another Silver. Damn, she is a superstar. Almost beat the ""imported"" Bahrain girl. I was severely depressed at Indian loss. I am an ardent hockey follower, and I knew Malaysia is a though but to crack. But it turned out to be reinforced concrete. It's so so disappointing.  5th straight gold in womens 4x400m. We have been winning this since 2002. Amazing! 3 medals in sailing for India today. 1 silver and 2 bronze. We have 62 medals now, 3 away from equalling our record of total medals of 65, made in 2010 Asian Games. Gcttirth gets demo bronze in hearthstone. I think we are in for another disappointment in hockey.  As squash doesn't seem to be covered I guess boxing final  is the last thing we have left to watch.(other than e sports). GOLD!  Anyone watched the hockey finals?!! What an absolute cracker of a match!! Update- Wrestling: Harpreet wins his bout against Sumi Masato 8-0, enters semis. Another medal assured for India. 

 Santosh Kumar wins bronze in Men's Sanda 56kg.

&#x200B; 15 year old Shardul Vihan wins silver in double trap shooting!  Indian hockey team defeats Japan by 8-0. Disappointing performance by India in Kabaddi and Badminton. India's future in shooting looks so good, lots of young stars are coming up. No one wants to play squash, I don't see any more stars coming up in squash after these four. Jinson Johnson bags gold in men‚Äôs 1500m  Multi medalists for India at 2018 Asian Games:
Hima Das(3), Md. Anas Yahiya(3), Jinson Johnson(2), Dutee Chand(2), Arokiarajiv(2), Dharin Ayyasamy(2), Fouaad Mirza(2), Sharath Achanta Kamal(2). Gnanasekaran though to Men's Table tennis round of 16. Had a good game against Indonesian. Today is going to be a historic day for India in its Asian Games history. Today we will surpass our previous best of a total of 65 medals at 2010 Asian Games. We can also equal our record of 15 gold medals of 1951 Asian Games today as we need only two more gold. Boxing and Sqaush is our best bet to get those two golds. And if we get three gold, then it will be our best ever Asian Games in terms of gold and total medals won. Great games for India. Thank you all for showing interest.  It was a great journey! 69, oh holy number! We have improved vastly and it would have been (it is technically) our best performance, if not for damned Bahrain and Qatar.  This was Sindhu's 5th final loss of the year...must be so frustrating to lose so many finals. I feel like she's been number 2 number 3 for the longest time and in that time a bunch of people have occupied the number 1 position and won something significant (Marin was number 1 for a while, Ratchanok was 1, Li Xuerui was 1 and now Asiad finals). I do hope she starts winning. 

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, I'm just an armchair critic who's sad at her loss and only hope that she goes up from here.  Update - Wushu: India‚Äôs Roshibina Devi Naorem has beaten Pakistan‚Äôs Mubashra in the Women‚Äôs Sanda 60kg quarter-finals.

The Iranian opponent also showed some great sportsman spirit. Gunneshwaran Prabhakaran gets bronze in Tennis men's singles. Update - Badminton: Saina Nehwal reaches quarter finals, defeating Indonesia's Fitriani.  Dipika Pallikal Karthik gets the bronze medal in Women's Squash after losing to Malaysia's Nicol Ann David. Fouaad Mirza has won the silver in Equestrian Eventing Individual. Women's compound archery team has reached the final after defeating Chinese Taipei. Finally some good new in archery for India. PV Sindhu is in the semi-final of badminton women's singles. Now 2 medals are assured in badminton for India. India need to win its tie against Iran, DPRK has already upset Japan in Group B, so if we finish 2nd behind China we would face DPRK in QFs. Update: Dutee Chand wins **silver medal** for India. Gold and Bronze medalists have difference of 0.03 seconds. What a race! Sudha singh on her way to Silver in Steeplechase.

Edit: Nope.

Double Edit: Yup. Neena Varakil is giving her everything in women's long jump to get the gold  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWfyPrlQrEo

Check out this video from 5 min onwards to know how hyperandrogenism is treated unfairly by Americans loaded IAAF. Dutee Chand fought her suspension in CAS and then came back to win like Caster Semenya. Am I mistaken in thinking CWG Delhi had good crowds than here in Indonesia especially the marquee sports of athletics arena being almost empty.

They were shooting superbly and totally deserved the gold medal.

PS: I have started to hate the Koreans as much those Iranians and bought off athletes üòÇüòÇ It is gold and for India in men's 800m !!!! Gold to Manjit Singh and silver to Jinson Johnson.

 In the mixed relays, Hima ran her lap in the second lane for half the race, until she realized that there was no lane at all, and then switched to the first lane.

Dont think we would have got the gold anyway but would have been a much closer finish. Boxing: Amit Panghal is through to the semi-final and India are assured of a BRONZE medal. I have to say amateur boxing is not exciting to watch. You think this guy is winning even the commentators get it wrong , but the judges choose the other opponent. No live scoring till the end of the match. Gold for Arpinder Singh. Gold for Arpindar. Bravo! Finally we are in double digit golds Events in which India can win a medal at Day 12 (30/08/2018) :

6:30 p.m.:- Athletics [Finals - Men's 4*400 m. Relay Team and Women's 4*400 m. Relay Team] Women's 4 X 400m , Gold. Silver in men's 4 x 400m relay. A good race by the Indian athletes. Losing to those imported athletes is not a true loss in my opinion. The third lap was crucial in surpassing Japan. Also nice trigger in the last stretch. Neither any of the channels nor sonyliv are broadcasting the squash semis. Any place else? 

Edit : Women‚Äôs team are through to the final. Will either face Hong Kong or Japan Amit into finals of Boxing !  I am so pissed man. No television broadcast of squash final. Finally India's winning tons of medals in sports somewhere. Why do we do so well in the Asian games but struggle in the Olympics? Fuck those oil rich middle Eastern countries buying their way to the Athletics medals. BC...this is turning out to be choking day. We have lost almost all games today... archery 2 final losses, badminton final loss, TT semi loss, volleyball qf loss against pak...boxing started with loss in quarters for sonia... All hopes now for athletics it seems... Why wasn't the football team sent to the games? I read that it was because they were considered unlikely to win a medal. However, Vietnam, a team much behind India in the FIFA rankings, are in contention for bronze tomorrow. Even Pakistan and Bangladesh sent their teams. I don't really understand this decision, especially with the rapid traction football has been gaining lately.   Update - Gymnastics: Indian women team qualifies for the final, finishing 7th on the table. Update - Tennis: Prajnesh Gunneswaran beats South Korea's Kwon Soon-woo. A medal assured for India in Men's Singles.  Update - Squash: Dipika Pallikal beats Indonesia's Rohmah Yeni Siti 3-0 in women‚Äôs singles Round of 16.

‚Äã Compound Men's team reaches the semis! Man these games are all so nerve-wrecking. Seemed like an easy win, but two shots of 8 and they needed a 10 to win...and he did it. So exciting. Indian men's compound archery team is also in the semi-finals. Great display of marksmanship. The ending was a bit nervous for India after they lost their comfortable 3 points lead due to two 8 point shots. But the final shot of 10 points ensured India's win with the score of 227 against Philippines' 226.  India wins brone in Bridge men's team and mixed team events. Md. Anas Ahiya wins silver in Men's 400m Santosh Kumar Tamilrasan has qualified for final of 400m hurdles. Govindan L has lost his bronze as he has been disqualified. Vey sad incident.

 Saina Nehwal gets the bronze after losing to Tai Tzuying in the semi final. She played good till 14-15 points in both the games but lost her momentum after it. WHere can i watch mens table tennis? 

Ten sports, Sony, etc is all actively discussing Dutee Chands 100m in the studio for the 100th time today. SHow us the events, goddamit! PV Sindhu has lost the gold medal by playing probably her worst final ever. Loose shots and low confidence. She needs to come out of the mental block she faces while playing in the finals. Don't know why she starts looking quite ordinary in finals compared to the earlier matches in a tournament. We got a bad beating today. No gold. Guess hockey and athletics are the only hope.  Pincky Balhara gets the silver in Kurash !! Very good performance by her to reach till the final and get the silver Fck man! I hate bahrain ..importing atheletes from africa( powerhouse in running/atheletics) ..even in women's 5000m now .
Feel like they robbed india of so many golds :-/ Fck! Another imported gold for bahrain :-/ Mixed team track event looks fun. And yet again ...robbed of a gold by Bah-fc-rain! Volleyball me I think they have bought firangis from Europe or America. Manika Batra is hot! First Indian female medallist in the history of TT So are we winning any medals today apart from Athletics? We scored 76 goals in the tournament and still not in final ffs  We beat Bahrain in track. WOMEN WIN GOLD IN 4x400m. WHAT A RACE!  All throw events in women China won gold. 4 straight golds. These throw events we have a better chance than beating African imports who even the world's best cannot beat. What is India's best rank ever in Asian Games and when? Vikas out with an injury. Lots of news reporting that he won't play his semi final and will settle for the bronze. The cut he received above his eye in the previous match is impairing his vision.

She was very fast right from the beginning.  Jinson Johnson has qualified for the 800m final after winning the heat 1. Table Tennis Women's Team is Out in QF, they lost to Hong Kong 3-1. Hoping Men's Team can win their match. Singles will be even tougher. Indian women's TT team has lost in the quarterfinal to Hong Kong. Sindu lost first set. Fingers crossed. Hope it gets to third set. Wtf is up with sindhu? Sindhu settles for silver. She wasn't in rhythm today. Tai Tzu played phenomenal. Hats off. Badminton women's final: Happened what everyone on Reddit expected. Sindhu needs to work on her final-phobia. Boxing womens featherweight (57kg) quarterfinals 

  Sonia Lather(IND) vs jo son hwa(PKR) start ho gaya bhailog Boxing womens featherweight (57kg) quarterfinals 

Sonia Lather(IND) vs jo son hwa(PRK) 

  We lost PRK dominated all three bouts
 So looks like this is it..only hockey is gold prospect now? Or do we have more gold opportunities(Wrestling maybe?) Jinson Johnson comes in with the best time from the semis. Hope he runs the race of his life. I dont think an Indian guy won the Asiad gold in 800m since Charles Borromeo in 1982. Pinky Balhara and MY Jadhav has reached the semi finals in Kurash women's -52kg ensuring 2 bronze medals for India. Okay guys Women's heptathlon has resumed with shot put event. We are currently at number 1 and number 3 position. Dutee Chand has qualified for 200m final by winning the semifinal 1. Hopefully Hima Das will too. Hima Das has been disqualified. Wtf is happening in this race. Don't they give warning or anything? I don't know much about Kurash but one thing is sure that Uzbeks are too good in it. Pincky Balhara has reached the final in Kurash !! She has ensured a silver for the country. Great performance by the 19yo. Just came to know from the commentary that Kurash originated in Uzbekistan. Explain why the Uzbeks are so good in it. any idea why the athletics stadium is 75% empty? I thought the Asian Games is a premier event which would attract lotsa crowds.  most of the top asian athletes are competing. probably low level of interest in a country like Indonesia.  India wins silver in mixed 4x400m relay. Fuckin' African-Baharainins Is dutee chand's race left today? What events does India have a chance to win tomorrow?  Barman is first with only the 800 meters left and the second place athlete and her have identical personal bests in the 800 meters. Hembram is in 4th and probably more difficult for her to medal. Why can we let those Bahraini athletes participate? So we can buy medals now; then where's the sport I reckon. Where's the patriotism and sportsmanship?  Achanta/Manika - India's best ever in TT are up against North Korea in Mixed doubles QF. Win here will assure another historic medal in TT.  Watched yesterday's highlights.
What did happen in men compound archery team? We were almost at cusp of winning gold medal.

Neeraj Chopra is surely my star. Hoping for Olympic medal tbh. 

 Second table tennis medal confirmed in mixed doubles for the first time ever. This has been India's best games. At least a bronze for TT mixed team! Man it was a bp rising game.  TT SF : Achanta,Manika against two boys 10 golds bhai ..update the thread üòÅ The direct feed commentators are so much better than the Sony ones. They don't even bother to do basic research about scoring system of the events they are covering. India lose relay appeal and squash women's team are in the semis. This Salwa Naseer from Bahrain just ran 4x100m relay and boy she was lethal. Feel for the Chinese for losing their gold to them though.

It surprising that she runs 100m, 200m and 400m  Seema Punia settles for Bronze in Discuss Throw When did the Malaysian team get so good? I'm not a regular hockey follower, but I remember so many games of India mauling Malaysia. What a gold in Women's 4X400m relay for India. Simply superb. Mens relay is more difficult..fuck... JApan ka lambu is kickass runner... and bahrain aur qatar imports toh hai hi Where is the best place to watch all the highlights? Like the womens 4x400m relay? 2 more medals in sailing - one silver and one bronze Esports semifinals is on. Glad to see india in there. Any more Golds up for grabs? One more strong gold medal prospect remaining for India today : Sqaush How come there's 3 Korea on the medal table? Anybody?  [China's humble brag not enough space in newspapers for all medal winners](http://www.espn.in/espn/story/_/id/24489130/china-asian-games-where-gold-always-good-enough) Anyone else thinks that PV Sindhu loses her nerve in any tournament final? Silver in men's .Beaten By Africa. Qatar(Africa) wins the men's 4X400. India settles for silver. Ayaz taking a dig at Boria for not knowing about Sailing,Boria with his usual overconfidence (mis)calculated all medal prospects the other day and didn't even mention sailing. Love some good banter xD Roshibina Devi wins bronze in Women's Sanda 60kg. We've come a long way from the first Olympic gold. The next olympics will definitely be the best so far Bridge mens pair gold.   

edit. so we match 15 golds. Armchair critics doing their work here it seems.
We did well this Asian games,last time was really disappointing, winning or losing is just a part of it. I don't see anyone complaining when we beat the Africans in women's 4x400 relay,which was a huge upset. Why complain now? Our women's hockey team in particular had a great game, we should appreciate it not demean them.
Only disappointment for me was men's badminton and our kabaddi performance,even there , people who had seen the last Asiad final between india and iran men's, should know that it was on the cards.

Tl;dr : a great Asian Games for india and we should be proud of our athletes.

 That shooting match in which Rajput won the silver, it was intense  [deleted] [deleted] Did India not qualify for the football event. Are they so bad in Asia too? Ankita Raina wins bronze in Tennis Women's Singles. 4 point lead for iran. 14 minutes remain. will be a massive shock if we lose. ajay thakur is all bloody and not likely to play anymore  5 point lead, 5 minutes to go. come on guys!! Olympics mein to hai hee nahi ab our one confirmed gold in the asian games is being taken away :( Update - Squash: Joshna Chinappa settles for **Bronze** after losing in the women‚Äôs semi-finals to Malaysia's Sivasangari Subramaniam.

 Update - Handball: The Indian women‚Äôs handball team defeat Malaysia 54-19 in their Classification 9th-10th Place match. Dutee Chand match link? Anyone. Please. Is there a 100m sprint? Wanna see who the fastest in Asia is. What is the progress in Womens Decathalon...last i saw barman was leading...this was after the high jump...any more updates...can't watch... India vs Pakistan in Volleyball. India is leading by 1 set to nil. It is a quarterfinal for 7-12. Men's archery team is playing at God Level. 6 out of 6 perfect 10s. Indian Archers are killing it!!

may defeat the world champions korea! Haha it's tied again.  Looks like players from other sports have left it to athletics to bring the gold medals in the seond half of this Asian Games. Swapna Barman is such a fighter. Giving her PB in shot put with a facial injury.  Tf is happwning!! Yaqoob Yaqoob. The name so nice you say it twice. A bronze and an assured silver in Kurash. Very proud moment for the athletes and the country. Mallaprabha Jadhav has won the bronze medal in Kurash. Why do Qatar and Bahrain care about medals anyway? Indian athletes in 20km walk disqualified ? Anyone know the reason ? swapna barman just threw her lifetime best over 50 meters in the javelin. She is back in the lead in the heptathlon. Crucial boxing QFs have begun... 4 Indians are in fray. Boxing has been most disappointing so far with zero medals. Why were male boxers bout without head protection but female is with ? Right, so athletic events of the day has begun... medal hopefuls - Arpindar in Triple Jump, Swapna Barman in Heptathlon, Dutee in 200m and qualifications of Manjit, Johnson in 1500 finals and Indian team in 4x400 relay...
There is also Womens hockey semi and boxer Dheeraj in QF coming up... more medal hopefuls Wasnt indian women's hockey at 4:30 today?
 Dutee Chand another silver(200m). Another silver in womens 200m thanks to Bahrain Thankfully we won 2 medals in boxing today in last leg. Hopefully they will turn it into Gold to save some face. Like Kabaddi, another disappointment this year. 
2014 - 5,
2010 - 9 Arpinder Singh is leading in men's triple jump. Uhh what? No manjit and johnson both are there 1 medal away from equaling 2014 medal tally Any events remaining for the day for India besides hockey ? Bronze in Women‚Äôs 1500m Lost to Malaysia in semi final during shoot out 6-7, Hockey men's. India lose the hockey semi-final similar story against Australia they are terrible in these shootouts. Lost to Malaysia in Men's Hockey. I was hoping for the India Pakistan final. :( Malaysia deserved to win they kept their heads throughout,going down to 9 men while ahead was utter nonsense,having said this  I don‚Äôt understand how was our first penalty even close to an obstruction. Any hope for any more gold medals? Boxing or Womens Squash? And yeah women's hockey! Bahrain won a gold + silver in 2016 olympics. Next games definitely they can get 7+ medals. Manika not able to pick the back spin of the boy. We are trailing 0 -1 in squash women's team final. Anyone know when is the final football match? I love how a lot of medals have come from athletics off late! Do you think it's because of improvement in training facilities over the last 2-3 years?  I don't know why Indian women's team is so dumb. This was a simple dumb play. Either we are dumb, or Japanese are very smart. Wasting 6 minutes allowing Japan to dribble the puck as much as they like when you are 1 goal down in the final quarter. Wow! Come on! What do you have to lose by attacking when you are 1 goal down! Yet India defended like crazy. Japan outplayed us. I am disappointed cause present Indian team has more potential. Both guys and girls. 

So no gold from hockey, yet again. I expected 2 golds considering their form and skill.  Just saw the compound women archery QF(?). What a game! They were trailing by 3 points and just before the last round it was all tied somehow. Three shots left and India got 10 on each shot! Really fun to watch.

Edit : It was the SF! They are into the finals!

That is quite a leap even for home games. What do you think is the reason ? There is clearly a gulf between Tai and other current women players. Sindhu has got more power in her smashes because of her larger stature but she isn't swift off her feet. She couldn't pick many of the drop shots she should have India out of boxing without a medal. But seriously man empty stadiums are so disappointing..can only imagine what thr atheletes must feel like :-( Op, now we are 8th. Update it please. our Table Tennis campaign ends with 2 bronze,great improvement in a world class field,Men's team and specifically Achantha did very well,room for little improvement in women's section.
All in all ,a great outing. One more gold and this will become our best ever Asian Games in terms of gold as well as overall medals. North Korea has more medals than INDIA. FTW. Man i cant get over the fact that if bahrain hadnt cheated us of golds we'd be number 5 ahead of iran at like 20 golds Gold done and dusted for the archery team  Do you need different body types for discus/hammer/shotput throw ? Never see athletes competing in both events. In swimming and track so many athletes do multiple events. Does anybody know how strong are Bahrain in women's 4x400 relay. If not for them, that's a strong gold prospect for us tomorrow. [deleted] when is manu bhaker's final?  Congratulations Anyway to watch the India v Iran Semi-Final Kabaddi match online?

 Hockey semi in the shootouts, 1-1. Other than 5000m any event left for India? Anyone knows where can I watch Sharath Kamal‚Äôs round of 16? 

Edit : He lost the round of 16.  How's india men's squash semis looking? Now I know why people were pissed after France won the FIFA World Cup We need to target field events in high jump,long jump,triple jump,pole vault and throwing events to win gold medals.

We have a smart TV, we're using Hotstar annual sports (299), Sony Liv annual (499, can also be paid using Google play credits earned through their rewards programmes), prime videos (free with Airtel postpaid's entry plan, also with Airtel broadband's medium plan), Netflix UHD (Sharing with friends @200 pm).

Mom: Watches movies on prime videos, Netflix, YouTube (nice collection of old Hindi films available for free) and some shows on Liv

Dad: Watches sports on Hotstar and Liv, news on YouTube and Hotstar. Movies across all.

Me: Mostly Netflix and prime video.

Bill = ~260 pm (little more than half of TataSky)

P.S. broadband prices are same as two years back, the FUP limit and speed has drastically improved. I wonder what'll happen once jio disrupts fiber space. If it wasn't for my Parents and their dumb serials, I would cut the cable and switch completely to streaming.  Just go for the service provider who is most prevalent in your area.

Source: Joy Bhattacharya on twitter. Fucking great. I was also born with twelve toes. This is where our similarities end.  Dayyyyum. Her arms are better than mine.  I am glad that non cricket sports are getting more and more female role models. One of india's biggest core problem is the gender gap in employment and this would encourage closing it.  I can't handle this. This is amazing... I saw a picture of a text book in West Bengal depicting Milkha Singh as Farhan Akhtar from Bhaag Milkha.
Times are changing in India. But they are too ducking slow. Time to honour the real heroes and patriots.
And stop helping Bollywood in creating utterly crap movies. For Ex: Sultan

Sultan doesn't show any training. Just that he falls in love and those athletes who are busting their ass since they were probably 5 yrs old are all defeated in 6 months? Dafuk?  Now I feel shitty for complaining about waking up and still being tired.. Truly inspiring.  Can we somehow donate to her or her family? What's her UPI id? [This dude too](https://youtu.be/XaEGDS_curQ?t=3m5s). I was laughing at his rather unconventional throwing stances but he ended up demolishing his competition and won gold for India. Dude is like the Hulk.  Perfect example for ""what's your excuse?"" Might be mistaken but I think her name is Swapna Barman not Burman. 

Apparently the tape was used to help with a toothache in and infected tooth that flared up at the start of the competition. It was decided to try antibiotics rather than removing the tooth mid competition.  Look at that face. Look at that body language.

Iron clad determination!  How I see it is that India does not deserve such heroines when it cannot feed them or at least provide them with the infrastructure. It is ironic to say the least and very sad that to achieve basic standard of living is a quest for the common man in India. A hero the country needs right now, but not the one it deserves I think that is not inspiring but opposite of it. Telling everyone how our country doesn't care about any sports person no matter how badly they need help or caring intervention.. Our country sux. We all should be ashamed of ourselves.. This and many such truths just points to sorry conditions and diminishes all hopes for youth aspiring to excel in sports. OP , Hero should be gender neutral.
She is my Hero. India can't afford spl shoes for her? Poor country? But can afford to send her to Jakarta ? How? Congrats Swapna Burman for her great achievement even in a time when she was in great pain  first thing I see on reddit today - immediate goose bumps. well done. Very well done. No offence, but i legit thought that bandage was some sort of  Flag. Am i the only person who read the last word as heroine? I know this isn't the point and I am happy for her achievement and what it means for our nation, but she is really hot. Those arms! * swoon * Now that's a role model girls should be looking up to. Not fucking Karina Kaif and shit. India has enough money to feed an army of incompetent bureaucrats and politician-cronies to plum sports offices with first class international travel etc., but ACTUAL sportspeople and their families will live in poverty. The Sports Ministry expects impoverished people to win medals on their own grit, claims credit for when they actually do, and then goes back to its sarkari routine of incompetence, apathy, and neglect of actual sport.  If only we could treat our sportsman/ woman as we treat our cows, we could we winning Olympic medals by boatloads but knowing our government and its cronies hey would rather apply to make COW Safety a Olympics game rather. Daughters of India are making us proud big time. Hope they get good recognition and awards for their sacrifice None of the other nations are that surprised that women from India can run really fast. Hail mother india !! ‚õπÔ∏èü§ºüèäüö¥ü§æÔ∏è This is the story of the entire Indian economy.  The Indian Government fucking people in the ass till they can barely walk, and then the people persevering and triumphing somehow, and then the Minister arrives and places a garland on them and puts articles in the paper so the country looks good.  


If you want to know how full of behanchods the government is, just see how the sports bureaucrats travel and their baggage allowance, and then see how the athletes travel and their allowance.  


Or if you want to feel your gut wrench at the limits of disgust, examine how the sports budget is spent in terms of funds and facilities for athletes versus salaries, benefits, offices, and allowances for the bureaucrats.  


Every time an injured veteran is working some menial job to make ends meet or an athlete is begging around town for sponsors just to get fresh fruits and meat for their diet, Indians should protest.  Because, believe me, Indian Government has allocated enough funds to develop sportsmen and sportswomen in India ... but those funds are being used to employ and benefit behanchods in the bureaucracy instead. Sometimes I feel the country doesn't deserve her. Talents like her are nurtured and groomed in other countries. I know I shouldn't be complaining and working towards it. I normally do. Today is not that kind of day. Pardon me. Proud of her. Feminism aside... Why is her face held together by tape?  Big deal! Hritihk Roshan has 2 thumbs in one hand and still managed to do that dance step! She's an Inspiration for future athletes. My girl!‚ù§Ô∏è you go gurl Amazing !

Fuck yeah, this woman probably works harder than any of us can begin to comprehend Where can I see her actual performance? I can‚Äôt believe the amount of spam videos with slideshows when i google her name!  India doesn't deserve such relentless sportspersons. Sad but true. This should be before she got to Indian team. Typical of Bollywood, let some unknown win some shit and then the Bollywood vultures circle around to make monies and ride to fame Correct me if I am wrong but I've noticed that all of Indian sportspersons are either from quite wealthy families or from very poor families like in this case. The salaried middle class never produces top class athletes. What can be the reason behind this?

Cut my cable back in Jan last year and got a Chromecast..its much better.. planning to get a mi box as it has more features While we ourselves may not watch Tv,  there are still millions whose only source of entertainment is the tv. 

My grandma would kill me if I take the tv away from her.  >I understand people still want to watch sports and news. We can watch these programs online for a very low fees.

Not everyone has access to unlimited high-speed internet. I live in a tier 2 city and I am finding it hard to give up on DTH and solely rely on the internet for streaming. Now think about those who are living in rural or remote areas or are not technologically savvy enough. It is not as easy as you are making it out.  6 years + here. Got feed up with mindless ads and 3rd class content. I do have all channels cause wife and mom. But me personally, I don't even know what to watch on TV lol. Used to be interested in news but there's nothing left there. 

So when I have absolutely nothing to do and I am tired of Netflix, YouTube, amazon prime, reddit... I turn on the TV, keep changing the channels for about 2 minutes and turn it off  Stopped watching. The most peaceful 1.5 yrs. Cable connection in my home is just for my grandma's shows. Okay some are saying they use Cable only because of their families. That's alright in my opinion. 
But atleast we can encourage our generation and younger generation who think they've got no other source of entertainment. Had been more than a year that I got rid of TV... Don't even own one now...have got so much free time now that I spend on improving myself. Where can we watch sports online for low fee? Amazon Prime Video ‚Çπ999

Hotstar Annual Sub    ‚Çπ999

Netflix(4 Person)         ‚Çπ200

SonyLiv                          Free

Much better than any cable pack you might subscribe to.  I haven't had a cable connection since 2014. Never missed it for a minute  I don't watch TV at all since school days. We were in boarding school and had no tv. College days there was no time. These days whole of the entertainment is online. I made the mistake of opening tv few times, what a bunch of crap that passes for a news, tv serial, reality shows etc, utter crap. The crap that we have on Indian tv will fall flat in front of any cable content from other countries. About time they think through how to make serials, news , reality shows, etc because newer generation of people simply aren't interested in watching TV at all. It's all about internet. Simple YouTube channels and news articles on the internet have better content than big media houses. And then comes these Netflix, Amazon prime, hulu type services that produces awesome content that people actually pay to see and can see it anytime any episode anywhere.  Wish I could tell this to my parents but TV is the only thing they have for entertainment so I really don't wanna screw with that [removed] [removed] I dont even watch TV since 3-4 years.Its my grandparents who are TV fanatics. Someone please explain that to my mum and dad who keep the effing TV and that set-top-box for absolutely no reason. Redditors please put forth your points to aid me I haven't watched actual TV in over 15 years.. ever since I left home for college. Couldn't really watch in college, and after I left college, I stuck to movies and TV shows from the internet. 

I tried watching a few times but was astounded by the sheer number of ads. Also, the fact that you have essentially a very limited choice at any given moment, and you have to wait for the show you want is too bad. I'm surprised TV has lasted so long. Maybe it's there for the older people and for news and sports. ",Sports,2019-02-02 05:45:37
"""India Was Such A Poor Place"": Lewis Hamilton Questions New F1 Races",96,9wzkjd,https://sports.ndtv.com/formula-1/lewis-hamilton-questions-formula-one-expansion-into-poor-countries-like-india-1947176,117,,CoolGuess," What he said:
> ""I've been to India before to a race which was strange because India was such a poor place yet we had this massive, beautiful grand prix track made in the middle of nowhere. I felt very conflicted when I went to that grand prix. can't wait for Indians to en masse abuse and downrate Levi strauss   Why such clickbaity titles.  He is not wrong, the track is way out of Delhi and not many people are even interested in paying so much to watch F1 race. The headline is so misleading smh. He is speaking the truth. Don't see anything wrong with his statement. 1 star to Lewis Hamilton in F1 2018 That poor image helps Hollywood directors get a Oscar. He's right. Not only is India poor but it has no racing tradition of the F1 variety. It's wholly imported, just like everything else. Really glad to see some sense being spoken for a change. When she says 'I want you to go away' but you only hear 'I want you '. I kinda wish we taught people a crash course on inequality and diplomacy. Hosting things like this is part of a country‚Äôs soft power export. 
When 2008 Beijing olympics happened, China wasn‚Äôt as powerful as it is today and a lot of its population was poor. Even if only 1% of a country is interested in things like this, that‚Äôs a whooping 14 million people for countries like China and India. 
As much as people want to think otherwise, all governments in the world care more about the rich and upper middle class who are interested in stuff like F1 Races. The voice of common Joe isn‚Äôt heard unless he have money.  BWOAH! Wait till he goes to Vietnam. Raikkonen Zindabad! Bsdk levis 

‚≠êüî≥üî≥üî≥üî≥ Only if the stupid policies hasn't put an end to the GP, its such a shame when you think of it. Guys, should we tell him about the statue? How dare he sat that? We are rich enough to waste half a billion dollars on an ugly ass statue out in the middle of nowhere just to score a few political points.  This is going to be an unpopular opinion because I know there are a lot of Hamilton and F1 fans in India (/s) and a lot of India-bashers. But here's what I have to say:

To me, whenever a westerner calls India poor, it evokes the same feeling like a thief calling you poor after robbing your house. The western education conveniently distorts world history and doesn't account for the centuries of loot that they are still feeding on. They built Suez Canal precisely to loot India and had thousands of huge ships taking away India's wealth into England. In fact, their media constantly talks about India's poverty to subconsciously (or consciously) justify the endeavors of their forefathers in India. Even Indian history books don't talk anything about the quantum of this loot, which creates a self-bashing brigade. 

Alright, this excuse has been overused, but it doesn't make it any less of a fact. 

Today, the rate at which India is growing, you'll see lots of westerners standing in the Indian work-permit lines within a decade. The tables are going to turn again. A lot of these ignorant tarts will need to reflect on what they said a decade ago.

A great way moving forward for you is to do an MBA where you wish to live post your MBA. With USA being the preferred destination for Sports MBA.

A large number of MBA programs abroad do however require you to have experience in the preferred field you wish to pursue your MBA in.

Look for opportunities within sports management in India or abroad. Look for certifications that might suggest to a college recruiter your inclination to pursue the same.

The art of bargaining/negotiation,19,anc8j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/anc8j9/the_art_of_bargainingnegotiation/,17,"Pretty much everyone I met in my life has taken advantage of me. I am 19 and I look like a fat child with a visible low self esteem and confidence. People keep throwing me around like a ball, insulting me to my face.

I decided to get thin. Went to a gym and was told membership is 6k for 3 months. I tried bargaining but I just suck. I don't want to ever bargain. It feels cheap but in India is necessary to do so. I thought to myself maybe the place has a strict no bargain policy. Cool, so I get it.

My friend joins the gym a month later for the same 3 months but pays 5.5. I ask the asshole receptionist to which she says ""sirf 500 toh kam kiya hai""... This is the same person who refused a discount of 100.

Trainers tell me to buy MuscleBlaze (they have a poster there for advertising) from them. They tell me it's as good as Optimum Nutrition. I didn't fall for that shit, place is scummy as fuck.

I can do legs well but upper body is really hard for me. I usually do 10 lbs and get down to 5 after a set or two. Often I see people smiling/laughing at me from a distance while I do it.

Go to therapy they said. 5 years and 1L in medicines and doctor's fees and things keep getting worse. I don't know how long I can keep this going.

I need help.",royal_rocker2," Find another gym or another activity (sport/swim/walk/dance/garden etc). Gyming is not for everyone and its not in the gym's interest to tell you that.

Tell them in a neutral tone, they aren't treating you right and providing a healthy environment. See what they say. If they decide to address the issues genuinely give them another shot.

If they act smart ask for a refund or you will be posting a review on Google/FB etc about the bad experience you had. Keep your messaging simple and don't start abusing, raise voice etc. Don't talk to underlings. Talk to the boss.

Think of this as a learning experience in handling these kind of issues. One or two times you handle these kind of situations, confidence will start coming back. i hate bargaining too. it's demeaning. [deleted] Brother, don‚Äôt ever think of that 6k as a poor investment. But as life nag as you get out out what you intended to , 6k is a very small place to pay. Commit to a workout , whether it‚Äôs weight, cardio, classes. Just be all in if you want something. Fitness doesn‚Äôt just give you a good body it gives you a whole lot more than that. I am a sports scientist, so believe me when I say that 6k is not more. People usually pay 25¬£ just to consult with me for their training program or even a training session for exercise or posture correction. As long you do exercises correctly and progress to lifting more you ll be good. Cheers r/getMotivated One thing I have learnt the hard way is that most of the things that we have are problem with or we are afraid of are in our mind. Our minds make things so much more complicated. I was diagnosed with Hypo-thyroid and I put on weight massively, which mean I was looking much less nicer than I did earlier. I developed inferior complexity of people making fun of me, having opinions about how I looked, to an extent that some people who were my friends were not willing to include me in any activity we did otherwise anymore. I was devastated.

Eventually, I realized whether you are short or tall, skinny or obese, people will look at you and make fun of you. You can't change that and no one will ever give a damn. What matters is that you chose to make a difference and work towards making yourself healthy. If you're not comfortable in the current gym, find another. When you begin talking about the costs, tell them that people have highly recommended the gym and you expect a concession. Be confident, people will look but if you're confident about yourself, they will look in awe too. Keep your vibe high. Wear things you like as long as they aren't over the board. You're beautiful, others don't have to tell you that, you should know that yourself.

However, my whole Instagram feed was filled with trolls on Pakistan players, Pakistani people, the Pakistan army and even terrorists were involved. I have enjoyed those trolls in the past, but recently I felt we are doing wrong. I feel like our humanity is dying slowly.",MainBuilder," Instagram meme pages wants likes and exposure. These trolls and memes get that. Most sports are competitive in nature, which entails winning and loosing. Because of our past with Pakistan, there will always be a hype surrounding our encounters. Nonetheless we are all humans and this important point is what most of us forget. Maybe some day, sound minds will prevail. Hoping for it sooner :) It is better to fight with bat and ball then with nukes. you want to snatch a politician's livelihood !! /s The thing is,in that crowd people who actually understands the game by all means are in minority. (90 % of my cricket watching/playing friends failed when I asked them to draw cricket fielding positions on paper. Short fine leg, mid on/off etc). Though not all my friends fall into this category,some are sane. 

This minority praises Mohammad amir for an impeccable spell , Pakistani openers for that partnership where even Aussies couldn't perform that and many more positive things. 

The remaining majority public is the one who unnecessarily forwards PKMKB , AKMKB (A for Afridi) slangs , trolls,memes which are against the  public and the nation overall which is pathetic. Memes are the best things happened to the internet and we all enjoy it but the one mentioned above is sad. This crowd belongs to both countries ,that makes it even more sad. The fact needs to be undertaken that if we decide to eradicate politics , everything is just fine , heavenly fine. At last , humanity needs a friendly environment to blossom. 

**Cricket** is a gentleman's game and let's keep it the way it is ü§ò. Next time do tell these morons about the off the field friendship between Sehwag/Akhtar , Akram/Sachin etc. Also about the incident where Younus Khan confessed how Dravid helped him improving his form.

Long live humanity,long live Cricket . Pakistanis themselves trolled their own players sooo Indian trolling them is a givenüòÇ Morons on both sides consider cricket=war. Fuelled by media frenzy and  past decade's  skirmishes between them. Schadenfreude.

Look it up. Human beings are cunts who revel in the bad fortunes of other cunts.

Humanity/humanism is a false notion drilled into our heads to keep us from straight up murdering each other without remorse. This enmity exists only in india and pakistan. 

Any other part of the world where indians and pakistanis live. They live like there is no war between them. 

e.g look at so many indians and pakis living in mid east. you will never see them fighting.

The reality is that its the politicians from both countries make it look like we are enemies. 

And about social media. Remember you can pay trolls to do whatever you want them to from both sides.

Suggestion for buying a badminton racket.,5,awcv5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/awcv5l/suggestion_for_buying_a_badminton_racket/,13,"Hello everyone, I am a beginner badminton player. I only play with my friends at an outdoor court located at his house (and sometimes at the local indoor stadium). Anyways, I am currently on the lookout for a badminton racket since the one I had got stolen long ago and I've been playing on a borrowed one ever since. So, I wanted to know whether it's worth it buying a racket from an online store or should I buy it from a local sports store? I've seen many reviews on Amazon and Flipkart regarding people receiving bent and broken rackets.",FelixGauss," Pro badminton player here, if you're a beginner, go with yonex nanoray or muscle power or a Li ning beginner series . I suggest you go to sport store and try out a few racquets , check their weights, grips and see what you're comfortable with. Meanwhile it's best to buy shuttles (I recommend yonex- mavis350) as well as  badminton shoes from Amazon, you'll get a sweet deal. And as others have mentioned Decathlon, I would definitely not recommend it. Decathlon has a pathetic collection of racquets from Victor and nivia. Both these brands are terrible and make low quality products.   the models suggested by users here good, I have an additional advice.

A cheaper but well strung racquet will be much better than a higher model with improper tension and small sweet spot.

My advice will be to spare 300-400 after purchase and then practice with it for a week or so.  If the sweet spot doesnt feel natural then, get [this](https://www.amazon.in/Yonex-Badminton-Strings-BG-0-70mm/dp/B00JP4R0BO) strung, BG 65 is the best for beginners and advanced players alike. 


Some times I have ended up opting a 500/- racquet over much higher models, just because the stringing was perfect and I could hit drop shots easily.  *racquet Go to a local sports shop since you can manually check the rackets before buying.  A nice one is costly and worth it. It lasts long and strings are strong and tight.
If you wish to continue to play for long term, buy a good racket.

"These Indians in Russia with banner saying ""India coming soon!""",2162,8rwxz0,https://i.redd.it/h5vdx5v9zo411.jpg,200,,kartiksoni2209," Ivan to believe it too!  Kerala, Goa and our north eastern brothers, I have great faith in you! India has already reached there. I saw Sunil Chhetri on Sony Ten 3. Go Boys!!!!!!!! Lets look at it this way, if we are to qualify for 2026, the youth players for that team are already 12 year old now, the right age for parents to start nitpicking them to focus on studies.     
If we want an outsider chance to qualify for the Americas, the change has to happen NOW. Slim chance of that happening.     
On the other hand, if we begin with a bunch of kids who are 4 now, and our government and society chooses to value any sport apart from cricket(for the country, i.e); we might set an ambitious target of 2034. China, on the other hand, has already begun its process and seems like they'll be in the WC by 2022/2026.  
 2026 appears to be the earliest time frame where India has a realistic chance of qualifying. That WC will have 48 spots instead of the current 32.  Hyderabad has cotributed so much to Indian football in the 1960s. Its unfortunate that people think of only North East and Kerala. Indian football team for 1960 olympics had 3 players from Hyderabad and a coach from Hyderabad. But since football was not so much recognised in Hyderabad and was not payed well many of the players from Hyderabad moved to clubs in Kolkatta. No idea what the first sentence says after ""the""  Yaay mallus!
 we will play in fifa, soon ver soon India arrived!!! I hope India doesn't host before making it on their own, what an embarrassing shit show that would be. White pancha(dhoti) - kerala Cmon India dhikhado ! Soon ‚Ñ¢.  This is the crowd that yells superpower 2020 unesco india best. sweeper swatch bharat se select hoyega As a European: INDIA PLEASE

It‚Äôs become standard discussion wondering when India and China will decide to play some football on our level. When you do all the other countries from your cultural sphere will do too.

Statistically 35% of the worlds football talent is in those two countries. are they some of the team? because i have a new favorite underdog.  Maybe in the FIFA video game. Very soon we'll be cheering and shouting bharat mata ki jai on Fifa Matches

Dream of every Indian football Fan Iceland with \~3 lakhs population can  produce 11 players who can fight with Argentina. Switzerland with \~80 lakhs population can stop Brazil. We can't produce 11 for WC. It's so depressing.

On another note. I was talking to a few people in Bangalore, Delhi and Bombay. They seems to have no interest in WC or football in general. All busy with career, money and booze. We need more fans like them!! Nope dont see it happening any time soon.
The problem being that sport is not actively supported in India by any average parent so regardless of talent we won't have too many stars playing for us.
Our future Messi's or Cristianos will be busy in their coaching centres fighting for the IIT worldcup.
Hell forget parents, i see very few schools or their curriculums give any importance to sports or physical education in general.
 I don't see the mentality change for the next decade.
Think about it, countries like Germany,UK,Brazil,Spain etc whose population combined does not match that of India and yet we cant find 21 players?
Cricket is the only sport that at present represents anything worth going after (awesome infrastructure and exposure) , so people would mostly only want their kids playing cricket.
Its almost like most parents only prefer sending their kids for engineering or mbbs when there are soo many fucking fields out there.

This is also the reason we're mostly shit in the olympics.(Atleast china is better in that aspect)

 Day Dreamer! Nice But I already came.  That has really made my day Yeah we are  no wonder! they must be from Kerala. it's pretty fucking amazing, the level of patriotism/nationalism and  child-like naivety Yes, We Indians cum soon, now you know why there are a billion and a quarter of us. They are coming to India soon?  2022!  Bless Given the international stats, India will surely be playing soon in FIFA. We are sooooo far from this right now. We aren't even in the top 50 yet. I think our current ranking is somewhere between 93 - 96? We have come a long way from 150-something but there is still a long long way to go.

After watching our matches in Mumbai, it felt like we're absolutely missing a midfield. We have a good striker, good defense and a good keeper. 

However throughout the match, our keeper was basically lobbing the ball into the other half where Chhetri would try to control it or link up with Jeje. If they failed, the cycle of defense would start again. 

I think we really need to find a few young creative midfielders first before we can go any higher. 

I hope we can make it to 2026 but that is a damn pipe dream right now. A more realistic target would be hosting the world cup and thus guaranteeing a spot or maybe aiming for 2034 or something, and honestly even that might be too much to aim for. Things are gonna take some time. 

Maybe if ISL becomes more popular and we have other/better/far-reaching ways of identifying and nurturing talent, and fixing the corruption in our system at the same time, we might have a shot at 2030 but I feel it's unlikely. 

Even a country like Egypt which has been crazy about football since forever, qualified this year after 28 years. 

Iceland, qualified for the first time this year. 

2006 WC winners, Italy, did not even qualify this year for the World Cup. 

And these countries have good football teams - the world cup is just the most competitive football competition there is and the way countries like Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Belgium, England, etc are spotting and growing talent in their respective countries, it's gonna get more and more competitive every year. Hell I was just reading about a 13 yo prodigy at BVB who has scored 40 goals this year in the U17 team. I mean, that's what we're up against - the likes and quality of Kylian Mbappe, or Marcus Rashford, Trent Alexander Arnold, etc in the future world cups. 

2026 seems very very very hard - and it'll take SRK &  probably a major chak-de type training cut scene to get there.  Let‚Äôs finish feeding kids nutritious meals so their mental development isn‚Äôt stalled due to malnutrition during puberty first. Then we will worry about football.

> Tharoor‚Äôs bill seeks to regulate online sports gaming, which basically means games involving the prediction of the results of a sporting event and placing a bet on the outcome, in part or in whole, by means of a telecommunication device. As fantasy gaming is in relation to an actual sporting event, it will also be covered by the ambit of this bill.

The proposed regulation only covers those activities where betting/gambling is involved. I hope I am using correct flair. In before you guys pounce on Tharoor, here is what his proposal states-

>‚ÄúThe main purpose of my bill is to preserve the integrity of sports. The bill is primarily divided into two parts for this purpose. One part recognises the offence of sports fraud and prescribes a special procedure to deal with it. The other part acknowledges the fact that the increasing commercial nature of sports increases financial incentives for vested interests to manipulate sporting events, therefore it provides for the regulation of online sports betting activities,‚Äù Tharoor said.

"Abuse us, criticise us but please come watch Indian team play: Sunil Chhetri appeals to football fans",2571,8o6w69,http://www.dnaindia.com/sports/report-abuse-us-criticise-us-but-please-come-watch-indian-team-play-sunil-chhetri-appeals-to-football-fans-2621437,204,,VibgyorHue," (reposting this comment with match details since original post was removed) 

Guys, if this video even remotely made you curious about Indian football do join us on r/IndianFootball, we would love to interact with you and discuss the game.

Mumbaikars over here, if possible try to attend the game on 4th June vs Kenya. Trust me it will be a good experience. We are on form after scoring 5 past Taiwan (check out these goals [5-0](https://streamable.com/4c8d0), [4-0](https://streamable.com/cwhpq), [3-0](https://streamable.com/z3e9u)) and Kenya are a tough team, it will be a good result if we can win tomorrow. 

Now let's go through the usual excuses that will stop you from going to the game.

**The timings are weird:** No they are not, the kick off is at 8:00 PM, after office hours for most.

**The stadium is far:** Mumbai Football Arena, Andheri. It is right next to the Azad Nagar Metro Station.

**It's raining:** Well most of the stands at the stadium are covered, so no worries there.

**Where to get tickets/ tickets are expensive:** Buy them from [Bookmyshow](https://in.bookmyshow.com/sports/football/intercontinental-cup-tournament/india-vs-kenya/seat-layout/aerialview/ET00075919/SRCX/10023). Tickets are 250 and 500. I leave it to your judgement to decide if that is expensive. 

Need another reason. Tomorrow **Chhetri will get his 100th Cap for the National Team**, all the more reason to see the team in action live. This is what happens when you host matches in cities where the Indian national team has less fan following.Why not host these international matches in Kolkata , Kochi, Guwahati or even Aizawl or Bengaluru .  Really hope one day India will play the FIFA World Cup  Even my friends who love football don't go to these matches. 

Indian football has no audience.  This is heartbreaking. Coming at a time when our team is getting great resuluts, i hope this appeal results in a larger crowd I did go for the match against Chinese Taipei. It was an awesome experience. Would really recommend anyone who is in Mumbai to go for it. You wouldn't regret it.  That single refusal to play in a world cup has cost us dearly down the line. The biggest problem behind our terrible relationship with football is not corruption ( if that was the case then Nigeria, Ivory coast and Cameroon wouldn't pump out the kind of players they actually do) or lack of training facilities but a lack of understanding towards footballing as a career and the absence of grassroots level effort to make it popular among our citizens. Nope. We are just selective football fans happy with our Uniteds, Arsenals and Madrids of the world. How can watching Indian football be cool ?  \- A debate worthy majority \(generalised\) of football fans in India. Link to buy India vs Kenya tickets:

https://in.bookmyshow.com/sports/football/intercontinental-cup-tournament/intercontinental-cup-2018-final/ET00075923 What is your estimate as to when we can host the FIFA World Cup in India? If we go by attendance, then the U-17 one last year was pretty successful. If the United States can host a World Cup, I think India can in the 2030s at least.

Other than that, I don't see any reason we could qualify for the World Cup by then.

#India2038 Heartbreaking. I hope ISL lays the foundation for Indian football Goa, its mostly always fully sold out... :/ Unfortunately this is the painful plight of Indian Football. This needs to be changed. And we will change it. GoGoSunil üòÄ Is Indian football missing an football sporting app such as cricinfo. I remember when the cricket was not telecasted everywhere or even from school, ability to track the score and live commentry helped stay attached to the game. Or is there an app that I am not aware of?  This is so saddening  [deleted] Let persons of Indian origin play. Get rid of the nationality rule for them.  I'm not a football‚Äã fan but loving a sport which isn't cricket and not getting any support , I know how it feels. That‚Äôs really heartbreaking. I feel for him. Ashamed we should be. üòû i used to play football at school..loved it,children appreciated ..then went to college only to realise people dont care about football and shittalking about it even thou they havent kicked a ball in thier life.At this time,i am just a hopeless,sad spectator just as any other true football fan waiting for this country to change. Indian Football needs a spark of genius. Like a Messi or a George Best. This will spark the imagination of the younger generation. And the crowds will come, not because Sunil Chhetri or someone pleaded them to come, but because they 'wanted' to come.

Be patient. There is someone like this somewhere amongst our billion and I believe Indian Football will find these players. As of now, Indian Football is just not relatively as entertaining as some other more obvious options, for an average viewer, that is.  True, a lot of my friends are football fans but not a single one of them watches Indian football. They always go on and on anoint Manchester, Liverpool, Barcelona, and other teams. But when it comes to supporting national team they nope out of their as fast as possible. Then you hear them crying about India not making it to World Cup.  They should stop scheduling matches in Mumbai. Go to Delhi, Bangalore, goa, East India, but not Mumbai. The audience would automatically improve. Sorry for Sunil, but condition is not going to improve any time soon. We need a spark to follow Indian football, see wrestling or batminton these sport have great following now, at least Indian football team should qualify to second round of qualifications regrading world cup and be top 12 teams in Asia. That time people will really go and watch. I'm sorry monsieur, I won't be able to attend the match.
But will surely cheer for you on TV. Abuse us, Criticize us. Destiny still arrives. Tomorrow's match is at 8PM at the Andheri Sports Complex in Mumbai. Those who can make it, please do.

[https://in.bookmyshow.com/sports/football/intercontinental\-cup\-tournament/india\-vs\-kenya/seat\-layout/aerialview/ET00075919/SRCX/10023](https://in.bookmyshow.com/sports/football/intercontinental-cup-tournament/india-vs-kenya/seat-layout/aerialview/ET00075919/SRCX/10023) People will come up with all sorts of excuses \- you will see here in the comments.  A game that takes all of 90 minutes, compared to the so\-called 'international' game of cricket which takes way more time.  I grew up watching Indian football and playing the game too, there is no better sport. I've played in an adult league too.  I think it sucks that people pay up to watch Cricket only, and nothing else \(hockey too is untouchable except when they shine\).  Just goes to show, that certain kinds of thinking are deeply etched in people's brains, like hard\-wired.

Cricket is fit only for TV. Soccer on the other hand, works for both stadium, and TV.  Soccer also has this thing : even a school boy or college game can be fun to watch , in a stadium.  With a cricket game in a stadium \(with no replays, no big TV screens\) \- its a hit or miss game \- meaning visibility just isn't there \- with that small ball \- totally say goodbye to visibility with a red\-ball.

The  \*only soccer\* that most Indians insist on watching is when the cricketers warm up.

Even when they watch soccer, these people have very high standards  : the lineup has got to have a Messi, or a Ronaldo or some hero at that level \- anything below that is below their fucking standard. It is a circle. People will watch what interests them, sports improve because of the support it receives.

However, you can't force people to support what does not interests them. You have chosen a career that's a hobby for many, because they have chosen a regular path to feed their family. I'm a cricket fan primarily and support RCB and India religiously being from bng. Last year at a point when no cricket was on I had to pass my time so I just casually went through the sports channel , the EPL was going on ( I hadn't watched much football previously ) . It was Tottenham Hotspurs vs arsenal and my interest was sparked. I chose to support the spurs as they were more of the underdogs who punched above their weight and made it a point to follow all their games and now I'm a big spurs fan . 

So I decided to start supporting BFC too but after watching the EPL and level of play the isl quality paled in comparison. The commentary, the atmosphere and the feel of the stadium everything . So I can understand why people would choose the EPL and la liga over the ISL.

However the least we could do is support team INDIA if not our local ISL clubs because without support from the public there won't be much growth .  The standard of Indian football is very low and until and unless they qualified for world cup (which will be a miracle) its popularity will not gain momentum. Even the country of only few lakhs like iceland qualified for world cup which is a shame for Billion nation!! Quality brings crowd.  Ain't nobody got time for that.
On a serious note all you got to do is win something big and people will be all over you. Lol, why would someone spend money to watch football? Cringe. Borderline emotional blackmail. Get out of a field which doesn't get you audience/money/career/whatever. Indians don't like football. It's cricket all the way through. What you gonna do about it? Every country has such one obsession. And besides, what about other sports? Which one should we pick? What about other professions? You can't get literally beg for views or audience like this; it is cringeworthy. He gave two reasons to come and watch. 1. Football is the best game in the world. 2. He is playing for his country.

Unpopular Opinion: Get a DTH if you are a sports fan in India,3,bmk8q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bmk8q2/unpopular_opinion_get_a_dth_if_you_are_a_sports/,18,"Let me start by saying that Hotstar and SonyLiv have really bad quality, specially for live streaming. Their 1080p stream has really low bitrate and you'll notice really bad interlacing with really bad pixelation appearing every few seconds, specially if you have a 43 inch + HD TV. Literally any pirated 1080p stream will be better than Hotstar.

Now, people here really hate DTH connections and for good reasons, however those reasons don't apply for sports channels. You won't get ads in football, and you'll get ads in Cricket on Hotstar too. Further, the new TRAI regulations made packs costlier for those who want many channels, but really cheap for those who only buy it for few channels. You can just get rid of any base pack you're given, and need to pay a monthly fee of 153 rupees for Network Charges, and 23 rupees for Star Sports 1 HD and 23 rupees for Sony Ten 1 HD, paying less than 200 rupees per month in total.

Is popularity of cricket declining?,19,a7r8jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a7r8jh/is_popularity_of_cricket_declining/,31,"Is it only me or does everyone notice a sharp decline in the popularity of cricket in the past 6-7 years? Youngsters these days keep on speaking of European football clubs and less and less of international cricket/IPL. Even individual sports like badminton have gained a lot of spotlight in the recent years.

My take on this would be dramatic decline of teams like West Indies, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and even Australia. It's simply not entertaining to see teams like Sri Lanka struggle against minnows. International cricket wasn't really competitive to begin with (only 6-7 decent teams), but now, it has sunk to unimaginable lows.
Or maybe, it's because, youths these days have an access to much more entertaining content in the form of Netflix, Amazon Prime, or even YouTube.

What are your opinions on this?",Bob_11," Probably you only meet urban youth.   

 Quality of international teams have been declined but the popularity of the sport in India hasn't.may be test cricket lost it but not other two formats. People are following women's cricket as well.

Star sports paid 6100+ crs for broadcasting just home matches  Almost 60 cr per match. That's 60 percent increase from 2012 deal. And  Rs 16300+ crs for 4 seasons of IPL. 5 the most expensive broadcast deal for any sport league

They don't pay such huge sums without researching about the numbers and popularity

Last years IPL final had 10 million concurrent viewers just on hotstar.

There were half a million viewers for just an IPL auction yesterday.


Yes badminton football gained spotlight. Kabaddi has also got lot of popularity in India.

Overall  Cricket is still huge in India. Not with me. Trouble is, tests aren't televised much in the US. Is there a YouTube channel on which I can see recent ones? Mostly all I find are clips. I dont watch cricket as I used to 6-7 years ago. No time and most players I liked retired  Here are my (non-indian) observations

&#x200B;

In the west indies, youngsters have definitely turned to other sports (primarily athletics). 

In the UK, South Africa, NZ and Australia , I think there is a lot of competing sports, but cricket still has a strong following

In india, the enthusiasm seems very strong and vibrant compared to other places, especially because of the IPL - I  think you are leading the sport into the 21st century and I actually think the reach of cricket is going to expand internationally because you have made it more accessible no , as a cricket follower i go to see every india match that happens in Eden gardens and every time i see good turn out No I personally lost it after the 2nd season of IPL. Cricket won't reach anywhere till they change the rules drastically. All popular sports are under 2 hours generally, with few and far between ad breaks and constant play. Cricket format is irritating with ad break every 6 balls, longer breaks for wickets and inning change. They need to make it a faster sport. Almost a minute passes between two balls and that's getting boring. Add to that field changes, long run ups, side screen adjustment and it just becomes a lethargic one almost compared to other sports. Cricket gets most flak for it lacks athleticism when compared to other global sports.  

I love cricket and watch every opportunity I get. But I doubt it is going to grow any more than it already has. I believe we've reached the peak of present day cricket.  Among urban youth yes Yes, 5 years ago I used to see a lot people glued to their TV screens during the India matches. Everyone I knew used to talk about the match on that day. However, the craze has waned a lot now. Good question. There has been somewhat of a decline I suppose and you are right about the lack of form of the international teams as compared to the 90s. I mean, Zimbabwe was actually a team back then. Now, it's nowhere. Still, it's the one sport we're good at, it's the one sport where we can all come together and support our team. I don't see any other sport or activity giving us that feeling. I think our football team had to beg us to turn up to one of their matches and celebrities and influencers are always chiding us to pay interest to other sports. For now, there's no other game in town. Cricket is the premier sport but soccer is growing quickly.  Nah,We are just growing up. Cricket was never that competitive at international level like you said. Only a handful of teams forever. One dominates for many years and then another comes. Other sports are actually more competitive, European club football for example. I agree with your second paragraph, it's just not competitive anymore, along with constant boring series with Sri Lanka at home I see no point of watching matches. We need a India - Pak test series to spark some excitement. You should get out of your bubble more often IPL ruined it. Now there are matches almost year round. Doesn‚Äôt feel special  I belong to Rahul Dravid era of cricket.  Cant find time to watch test matches, Absolutely dislike T20... I used to watch it just to watch the players I used to follow. Dravid, Sachin, Sehwag, Ganguly, Shohaib Akthar, Afridi, Hayden, Gilchrist and more others obviously. I used to enjoy watching them play. Once they all retired. I kinda stopped watching. Over 10 years ago.

The war used to be between players, purely. Sachin/Sehwag opening against Shohaib Akthar, Wasim Akram, etc. But now all i see is ignorant people and kids who just say ""Its India vs Pakistan!!"" when all the players are new who don't even really know each other cause the teams dont really play against each other anymore. The whole India vs Pakistan is completely irrelevant now. Been for a while. I guess what's running in people's minds is that India is playing against a muslim state/terrorist country etc, more of a hate hype. Im pretty sure that's the case

Also the entire IPL crap became so commercial that it was all about money and entertainment and not about the game.   [deleted]",Sports,2018-12-20 06:16:27
Sunil Chhetri has equalled Lionel Messi with 64 International Goals.,2573,8q6gjc,https://i.redd.it/3tohd96kma311.jpg,111,,Cap-10," It's not about he scored against small teams he did no other guy have done for india it's something mesmerizing. People are saying he plays against small teams. Shouldn‚Äôt the captains of New Zealand, Kenya etc also top this list then? This makes me proud, and I‚Äôm ashamed to say I only got into Indian football after his heartfelt video. I‚Äôve seen maybe 4-5 of his 64 goals. Amazing. Jai Hind Way to Go SC11 Wow. Really proud of him. Chhetri has a better Goal per Game Ratio than Messi and is now joint 2nd Highest Active International Football goal scorer.

India is proud of You Indian Football Captain Sunil Chhetri. Serious question- I'm an Indian living in the States. I want to support the Indian football team. I have a kid who is about to turn two, and I don't want to fall into the easy cricket fandom that's so accessible to expatriates. We don't have a tv or cable connection by choice. Does r/India have any suggestions? What's the world record?  No, Sunil Chhetri is not a Messi or a Ronaldo. He played against much weaker opponents. However, we should also remember he didn't get the quality training or guidance like them in India. There's also not much money in playing football in India. Chhetri's networth is only about $1 million while Messi's $340 million and Ronaldo's $400 million. 

In spite of all that he is in the elite list of highest international goal scorers ever. It was not an easy milestone because no Indian player couldn't score more than 20 international goals before him. So all praise to him. Also, we should remember that we need Sunil Chhetris to prepare the ground for the future Messi from India. He is an amazing Footballer. Have anyone seen his video asking to support him? it was heart breaking video. Surely he is a great sportsman, probably the best footballer India ever had. I'm proud of him. 
But for god's sake don't compare him with Lionel Messi by giving such context-less stats. He plays against smaller teams, I'm sure he himself wouldn't like to be compared with Messi.  Guys subscribe to r/IndianFootball, we've been trying to build an Indian football community on reddit and we host regular match threads, discussion posts about Indian Football.  Very impressive!! Well done Sunil! He's good in his own rights. But don't compare him with Messi and Ronaldo. He himself said it. Compare him with captains of teams of similar ranks as India. 
Art is long and time is short.  difference in opponents. Lel to see many people getting butthurt with these stats.  The real underdog Wow.... The real proud of nation. Has he ever tried to play for a European club?  This post needs to be at the homepage Is the second figure the number of games, or shots on goal? Little fish in a tiny pond maybe there should be an option to pick 1 foreign player from unqualified teams in the world cup, then maybe India can really get into Football this is proudest moment for india and we should support indian football team equally as cricket Cool. Don't know what it means but must be something if people are congratulating him. Which IPL team does he plays in? I really hope that this guy gets to play under a better flag.

I don‚Äôt really follow sports but was there no hype about him? Literally none of my sports loving friends were talking about this even though they stay up and watch every Fifa world cup game.

Once he does start playing for someone who appreciates his talent, all our bhakts will get enraged and start calling him a traitor.  Why tf is he compared to them?! Second to no one. Is literally second on the list.

Great feat! Hopefully we emerge as a team to be reckoned with inthe years to come  too bad he can't even play for weak teams like everton or something Glad to see India is progressing in sports in Modi Ji's rule.

* **Give their image rights to the ESFI forever**  
* **Are not allowed to sue the ESFI**  
* **Cannot withdraw under any circumstances**  
* **Can be fined for anything based on the ESFI's discretion and are obliged to pay in 15days**
Among other things.

This has received alot of flak from the international esports community and caused ESFI to to release a statement which is basically PR bullshit and no guarantee that anything will change.

Here are some sources and links to the whole drama:

[R Lewis, an American esport journalist made a video about it](https://youtu.be/9RUylicbek4)

[Bleh, who is arguably the most prominent esports figure in India](https://mobile.twitter.com/OfficialBleh/status/1004430804913541120)

There have been posts about this in esports subs but I haven't seen anything here or in the Indian news. It's a really sad state of affairs where these players have to pay to become a contractual slave in order to represent India ",DoubleGremlin181," Forget media. Indian public at large doesn't give a shit about esports. I doubt if the average common man is even aware of it.  bruh gaming is frowned upon by the indian public more than street shitting... what do you expect?

I really hope that things work out in favor of the participants Will take atleast 10more years to have esports relevant in India... This is just the starting path and it is rocky start... As someone who follows both LoL and Dota scene ... It is so sad ..  The contract is null and void since you cannot stop the client from seeking legal remedy.

If there is no payment or anything else being done from ESFI which means there is no consideration which also makes the contract null and void. Indian media has been sold boyo.. Most probably ESFI fellows will bring their whole families to the event and enjoy the shit for free. As someone who has played professional esports in india this saddens me. Is there actually any money in esprts in india? This is a country where the National Football team's captain and legend has to beg for people to come to see their matches. 

I dont think even 10% of the population knows about ESL and esports in general.  Someone tweet this to Rajyavardhan Sindh Rathore. The sports minister. He is a former olmpic medalist and might help here. Contact Nandan Kamath or his NGO. He's a leading and passionate sports lawyer from NLSIU and Harvard who's worked on a lot of pretty similar sports contract issues. He'll sort this out. This is classic administrative body attempt at fuck-ery. Best of luck. Emailing this to Ravish Kumar. Indian people only care about their cricketers and bollywood stars. SMH üòí Indian sports apart from cricket is in such a bad state, hell even the blind cricket team which won world cup isnt officially supported by BCCI, WTF.

The recent Sunil Chetri post where he was begging fans to come watch the game messed me up real good.

Football, Esports, Olympics, Hockey and many more games deserve way more attention.  u/dhruvrathee spread the word I have now decided to stop watching cricket completely and try my best to promote every other sport, including esports dota2, csgo etc. Our country fails to give water to our Olympic marathon runners who are running for the country and blames the athlete and you expect them to say something about e-sports? I don't want to name my publication but you can see my post history and figure it out if you want. I wanted to point out that we have tried to reach the federation and the sports ministry as well as IOA for a comment on this. We tweeted to RS Rathore too, but predictably there's no response. I'm glad you posted this so I have more leads to follow. Inb4 some vidhayak gives a statement "" people who can afford esports should easily be able to afford all the expenses"" Are they really recognized by the Indian Goverment? I assume it will eventually get better since this is something new right ? or am I assuming too much right now ? Bc. Yahaan media logon ke protest mein Marni ki shit's nahi deti. And tujhe esports ki padi hai. I didn't even know we had a fucking ESFI, this is preposterous. This will kill esports in India, even before, it becomes something. RIP fucking Indian esports. As usual, we are about to lose an industry where the rest of the world will be raking in billions of dollars.  [deleted] r/indiangaming Lol What is esports? Is it any different from video games? This is why India does badly in sports competitions. Even cricket selection is still a bit corrupt What are esports? I'm crossposting this to r/choosingbeggars No one gives a shit about esports in India. We're too busy with IPL. now don't tell me u want government job for winning in esports also. I doubt the babus know anything. they may be fulfilling some checklist for participation prize.  Wtf we had a exports federation??I follow exports a bit but never knew about this.

Anyways the federation is corrupt and incompetent and fucks over everyone possible to loot them.Is this even shocking?that's like every single organizations in India.In India organizations are not made to help people but to suck people's life out of them.

And yeah indians won't give a fuck about it not because only few people follow exports but because corruption, incompetence and abuse of humans are accepted norms in India.",Sports,2018-06-08 21:12:50
"Meet our nation's future Olympian in shooting. She just blew away Commonwealth Games Record and won Gold by a huge margin of 6.9 points, defeating another shooting veteran Heena Sindhu. And she was born in 2002! just 16yrs old!",2413,8an6e2,https://i.redd.it/96xhvu4oklq01.jpg,189,,nolanfan2," >born in 2002

Fucking hell I've never felt this old. And to think that someone this young has achieved so much while I've just sat on my ass for most of my life..... I have this funny feeling of being sad and happy at the same time. Some more facts facts about Manu Bhaker which will make you feel like a grandpa/grandma
-

- She bought a pistol for the first time pistol in 2016, her shooting experience is less than 2yrs

- Her international experience is just 1 year

 Such a long ass title and no name in it.  That's great! We should make these type of sports more accessible to people. Shooting is an incredibly expensive sport to get started on, at least for the majority of Indians.

There is a government managed shooting academy about one hour distance from my house. A few years ago, I thought that my aims were pretty sharp, and there is anyway a shooting academy so close to my place. So, I should at least go and try it. What if I am really good at it and I never knew?

So, I went there along with one of my friends to inquire about it. There were some people shooting in the shooting range, some students were being trained etc. It seemed pretty fun, so I went to the office to ask more details on how to join.

All I wanted was to see if I have any talent in this sport. The person in the office said that I will have to first take membership for the shooting academy which will either cost some 20k per year, or 50k for lifetime. I said that I am new to this, and all I want to do is try it for few days, and if I am good at it, I will register for the membership. He said that the only way to join is by taking these memberships.

I was a student at that time, so I couldn't afford paying that much on my own, but I was earning a reasonable income from my websites, so if I wanted, I could take the membership. So, I decided to ask more details.

I asked if I can try one of their guns in the shooting range for a trial. Afterall, without shooting a single bullet, how would I know that if I have any talent for it? How would I know if it is worth it to spend so much money on a membership?

He said that it is not possible to try, and also that the shooting academy doesn't own any guns! He said that you will have to buy your own guns, and the clothing required to be used while shooting! He said the overall cost for a gun used in this sports will start at 1.5lakh, and if you want a good gun then you should buy the ones over 3lakh! He said it costs this much because they are imported.

^^*All ^^the ^^costs ^^mentioned ^^in ^^this ^^post ^^are ^^approximates. ^^This ^^happened ^^many ^^years ^^ago ^^and ^^I ^^dont ^^remember ^^the ^^exact ^^figures.

At that point, I decided that it is not worth it and left. I thought in my mind - What is the point of having a government-owned shooting range if they don't even have a gun to shoot?

 I was born in 2002 and I'm here chilling in my pajamas  [deleted] She is shattering all the records in every competition and she is only 16. Well done manu  The most important info that OP missed in their long title, the name, Manu BHAKER I have a feeling that she'll win at the olympics too. !RemindMe 2 years An incredible job was done by them.
Making India Proud. Go Team India Hmm, she's from a village very close to mine.  And until now I used to consider anyone born in the 21st century as kids. Just realised, kids born in this century can become a major after this year.

Edit: Time flies by so fastly. o_0 Sports ministry, please don't mess this up. Such a simple and focussed kid, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A9w7epbL2x0  let's hope she continues the purple patch, asian games and olympics coming up next. üíì Why does shooting have different categories for men and women again? Govt should sincerely back a talent like her for a long time.
Show some real support to promising future for once.


India doesn't care much for international glory in sports for some reason.
BC Cricket ke aage their eyesight fails them. I can't hold my arm steady let alone hold it up for more than 10 seconds without it aching LOL Even with aim assist in video games, I wouldn't be able to beat her. btw how come 16 year olds in media never actually look 16 >.> Is it Sidhu or Sindhu?

I went to a KV for 12 years and this is fucking relatable.,342,94ufcl,https://i.redd.it/hp340q3psbe11.jpg,74,,obhione," Went to KV in the 90s.. Had no PT teacher. PT class = Get deflated football from sports room and kick it around for few mins. Then eat bread pakoda 1. ""Stand in a straight circle""
2. ""Why are you looking at the monkey outside the window when I'm here""
3. ""Girls to my left, boys to my right and the rest of you in the middle"" [deleted] ""Rotate the ground four times"" - PT teacher, probably I didn't go to a KV in the entirety of my school life and this is still fucking relatable. The fucking whistle. PT guy would whistle at every occasion.  Our PT used to flirt with the girls all the time while making us boys pick stones from the ground. He also used to give them good quality volleyballs/shuttle cocks, but we used to get some kachra punctured deflated football.  I am a KV student from 90s. I hated the bastard, he would randomly come around and beat us up for slightest of reasons. If I see him today I would punch his face, however old he is. Change that to ""shivnaresh"" tracksuit  Went to a few kvs, 2 of them had swimming pools.

One thing them had hard court basketball and tennis grounds.

Games period meant going to sports room and choosing football for boys and tennis racquets for girls. 

While on ground, mostly meant running around without any reason or play. 

Only serious coaching ever received was for interschool cricket where once selected guaranteed a kit without bat and guard.

Passed out in 2005. Wtf. This is too relatable and specific. It's like an universal rule.  Went to KV in the 90s and the PT teachers didnt wear shoes.

Only Rs 30 plastic chappals (whose price he would brag about) before using it to smack us around. Give me a red pen of any color *While Rehearsing marching*-
PT Teacher: you are doing 60% correct. Do 30% more we will be 100%. Pick the paper, throw the dustbin ""Be quiet. The head master is rotating in the corridor"" had a PT teacher who kept saying ""open the windows and let the airforce in"". also he drank alot, there were always booze bottles in the sports room.  ""You want me to come there or you come, if I come you die"" our PT instructor molested a class 5 student and got kicked out of school. Not PT teacher but it was our Physics teacher who said some gems like, ""if you compress the button"", ""if we hot the milk"" etc. üòÇ Spent 12yrs in KVs all around India, fucking accurate I must say *Bharat ka swarnim gaurava Kendriya Vidyalaya laayega ...* Inspired by [this article](http://www.arre.co.in/people/angrezo-ke-zamaane-ke-pt-sir/). Went to KV for 12 yrs too and its spot on. And the beating we used to get were hardcore.  Goldstar shoes are damn good shoes . Not true in my case. Our PT teacher was a gym trainer, and he'd train us for either volleyball or badminton or any other sports every time. u/_waks_ We used to call our pt teacher 'saabhu' from that old comic chacha Chaudhary and saabhu.  [deleted] Fellow kvian here,passed from gurgaon sec 14 kv,our p.e teacher was skinny,other then that its spot on Why are all PT teachers the same? Forgot to add 100cc boxer...

"Can poor, govt school educated students compete with urban upper/middle-class students in India's rapidly depleting job market?",15,a5sd0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a5sd0v/can_poor_govt_school_educated_students_compete/,17,,UnlimitedSockWorks," The job market isn't depleting. New kind of jobs are coming up but it's not going to be easy for ill prepared.   Navodaya Vidyalaya solve this problem to an extent No I have observed people who score good like 80-90+  still carry the trend to Uni even if they are from government school and non English medium. They get past the hurdles. If you are average though you might fuck up.  Myself from village area and government school and non English medium. I fucked up in 11th but once I managed to get into college I did not notice urban kids having any significant edge in something compared to me.    With the right parenting/guidance? Yes! In urban areas, even poor families send their children to private schools. Of course the quality of these private schools might not be that great.  My parents are from Himachal Pradesh and from what I've seen, even in small towns or nagar panchayats, there are at least 4-5 private schools. Only the poorest and village kids attend govt schools.

&#x200B;

Govt has converted a few small town govt schools into English medium to increase enrollment in these schools. These schools have IT labs and computer teachers too. Another advantage of govt schools is that they have huge playgrounds and unlike private schools, education is not the only priority so a lot of students are encouraged to get better in sports and if they can win even at state level games, they can get sports quota in govt jobs. They might not be as academically brilliant compared to private school kids, but I think their overall development is better. Also, govt school teachers are generally well qualified and govt has introduced attendance machine in some schools so that teachers can't take leave whenever they want.

&#x200B;

Now you would argue that knowing English will not make anyone more knowledgeable, but given that any subject we study is only available in English language especially at university level, much of the internet is in English which is becoming day by day cheaper in India, even the low paid jobs like salesman/ waiter require you to know basic English, I think that knowing English will help them a lot.

&#x200B;

Also, take a look at this article how govt schools are adopting English medium:

Those of you who haven't watched the match, look up the highlights, their control was on point and Savita Punia is easily one of our best goalkeepers in this decade.

"Pro Kabaddi ratings crash, viewership down by 31% from last year; Rural areas worst hit",58,9slck9,https://www.insidesport.co/pro-kabaddi-audience-ratings-crash-rural-areas-worst-hit-barc-data/,22,,LeastKarmaonReddit," This is the problem for non-cricket Indian leagues, once the 'shine' starts to wear off, the viewership plummets. I just read, dont they do this league twice a year?! I mean the market is already so saturated in sports dept, doing it twice a year is just reducing its novelty, and just points to milking it. 

Lack of an international body is hurting the future scope of this sport. With football, you have fifa wc. Cricket has a very active international cycle, badminton/tennis have their tournaments throughout the year. 

One can say kabaddi has reached its peak and will go downhill, until they can bring out some interesting challenge to kabaddi as a whole Do they take into account the online views?  Expected.

They moved to a state identities instead of city identities while expanding. Gujarat Lions, Tamil Thalaivas, Haryana Steelers,  Telugu Titans, Bengal Warriors, UP Yoddhas. WTF! Why mess up with a proven model of city based franchises? 

PLus, they should have awarded franchises to cities which don't have IPL/ISL teams. Like, Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, Kochi, Raipur, Ranchi. so sad to see that no sports other than cricket is getting the much needed attention of both people and govt. of this country  I think the issue is that this tournament is in complete Isolation, and there's no component that leads from this (National Football Team, T20 World Cup, etc.). Plus playing it twice a year was like killing the golden goose.  I'm a cricket fan probably because it is the only sport that I got immense exposure to. What can we really do to promote other sports? Yes a sport where semi literate Neanderthals grope each while being as sanskari as possible. If they really want this sport to take off they need to do it WWE style. Semi nude semi literate Neanderthals dressed in their chuddies having melodrama while groping each other. This will sell. Plus any sport that has a chance of succeeding in India needs large numbers of middle class people to participate in it. Middle class people don't want to see rural or poor folks on TV. They need to see people from around their economic strata looking ""cool and hip"".

Has anybody completely lost interest in Cricket and stopped watching it completely in the last few years?,348,8ggibm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ggibm/has_anybody_completely_lost_interest_in_cricket/,198,"In my opinion, T-20s are a drug. In the initial years, they were damn fun because you only got to see them once in a while may be a few times a year. I call them a drug because T-20s were faster, more fours/sixes, more energetic and more interesting when viewed after say a few test matches and ODIs. But like most drugs when you do too much too soon, it's negative for you.

Lately, T-20s are too much too often and over commercialized. Cricket was supposed to be a fair competition between the bat vs the bowl. With T-20, the bowlers just get thrashed. Agreed they have to bowl lesser overs but I have never heard bowlers say anything positive about T-20s. Whether it be in interviews or chat shows, bowlers seemed to be disappointed with the new format. There is no strategy, no help from the aged ball/pitch etc. Just pray the batsmen don't thrash you too bad.

I remember watching 50 over ODIs and test cricket and it was fun when the ball and pitch started showing its magic once it aged, how they changed strategies with new vs old ball, setting up traps etc. Now the focus has shifted more to getting higher scores every single match. 

Fours and sixes were fun because they came once in a while earlier. Now with every single bowl, the batsmen are swinging their bats as if its gully cricket. 

Over-commericalization: I fucking hate when the screen goes small to show ads after every single wicket or six or something like that. BC kitna ad batayega. There are advertisements after every over, every wicket and every delay. There are multiple ads on the cricketers t-shirts, pants, helmets and bats. There are ads on umpires clothes as well. Ads on the boundary line rope. Ads on the screen behind boundary line rope. Giant ads on the pitch. Ads on the stump. Ads on the 3rd umpire screen. Ads at the screen during prize distribution. Ads on the cup/trophy/very name of the event like [ad name] ODI SERIES or [ad name]IPL SERIES. 
BC sports main advertisement hai ya advertisements main sports. And despite all this, I still have to pay for hotstar if I want to stream it online? You must be kidding me.

Over-glamorization: Trying to mix cricket with bollywood for so many years now just to sell more. And it's been working clearly but they are doing it at the expense of ruining the sport and losing old fans. I guess on paper they win because for every one fan like me lost, they will get a hundred new fans. But they need to be aware that when you offer clickbait content and tactics, the audience you get is also feeble and unstable. 

I also feel that breaking the concept of players representing their National teams and moving more into a football type teams where you buy players with money and the shuffling of players every couple of years in a bad thing.  Even to this day an India vs Pakistan match or even India vs Sri Lanka/Australia match will be more interesting than an IPL semi-final match to me. Now we have teams represented by States but with half the guys from a bunch of different countries and shuffling every few years and its just not fun. 

I was never too into cricket but now I have lost interest completely since the last few years. Can't even get myself to sit in once place and watch an ODI or IPL match anymore. Anyone else like me?",RantsnShitpostsIndia," ITT : We're test cricket elitists, we hate LOI's. [deleted] Today, I learnt r/india doesn't like cricket.  I was a huge cricket fan. I used to keep track of everything.. Every record, best average/strike rate, everything. My friends in college used to call me Harsha Bhogle because of that...now I can't even name all of the IPL teams. I lost my interest in cricket many years ago and its not because of ODI or IPL or 20/20. I have tried to analyse why that happened and I have come to conclusion that there are two major reason for that.

* I grew up with watching Sachin, ganguly, Sehwag, Dravid. One by one they started to retire and I couldn't connect with the newer guys as much as I did with them. I guess its a generational thing(not that I am 30-40 or something), but they were like my childhood heros. I also guess that for younger fans like teens, they see the current crop of guys and feel the same way as I felt watching sehwag hit fours after fours.

* Another factor is that for some unknown reason, we all like to cheer for underdog. India used to be an underdog it was so fun cheering them win. Now they are not the underdog, now they run the whole cricket world. They win all the time. They host others team and then beat the shit out of them in India. Kohli keeps hitting centuries every game and Rohit sharma hitting 200 trends on twitter every few months. I see India clean sweeping other teams and I feel..That's good and all, but now it's time to improve and focus on other sports too.  I never watched or played any sport. They never interested me. Maybe I'm weird lol You guys should watch football. 

And by football, I mean domestic football. ( ISL and India matches ). Most of y'all will probably say we're shite and shouldnt bother watching it but with that attitude we're never gonna progress in other sports if we don't support them.  
  And football is improving in this country and we've qualifed for the Asian Cup in Jan 2019 which is quite a big thing. If more and more people start supporting other sports we might excel at another sport that isnt Cricket.

India is playing a tournament including South Africa, New Zealand ( Both have played in the World Cup ) and Chinese Taipei in Mumbai from June 1st to 10th.   
  So for starters, Mumbaikars can go watch those matches

Also plug for r/IndianFootball :3 Well, I am guessing I am the opposite of everyone else here. I stopped watching tests because they are boring to me.  I watch a lot of ODI and T20 and absolutely loving this IPL. I didn't watch it properly the last two years due to work and travel but this year I am back full time !  **NO.** Lost interest around 2010-2012. Funny how I used to religiously watch cricket, hell I used to pray (used to be a theist back then), cry when we lost and got up at 3.30 - 4.00 for those test matches in Oz/NZ and stay glued to my old crt TV. Those were the days India kept losing but I used to follow cricket with passion. Kept big ledgers for player's careers (didn't have a PC back then), used to buy those fat yearbooks and read them like I was possessed.  Now when India is doing much better I find that I don't give a shit. I guess a certain amount of commercialization is good for the game but jeezus the unholy amount of ads of the fucking jerseys, even the umpire's, hundred kinds of ads on the screen. Bc let us watch the game for a change huh? People around me go crazy for IPL and I can't give a shit about these stupid tournaments about a bunch of corporate teams masquerading as ""cities"". Even national competitions don't seem to interest me anymore. Also, <personal opinion, completely understand if you don't agree> the cricketers of older times, VVS, Sachin, Sourav, Dravid and Kumble, they used to look like humble people whom I'd like to know and be friends with irl. Now the guys look like bullies and bouncers whom I'd rather stay away from.

Of late I've been watching replays of old test matches and ODIs on YouTube. I find that these matches are still a lot more palatable to me than the obscenity that passes for cricket these days. Take me back to the age of Akram/Gillespie/Warne/Dada/Waughs ans Rhodes. Yes, I lost my interest in cricket after Sachin retired. Some of my favorite cricket moments - 
Sachin's Sharjah cup innings,
Yuvraj Singh's 6 sixes,
Venkatesh Prasad clean bowled Amir Sohail after a spat,
Anil Kumble's 10 wickets in a test innings against Pakistan,
Srinath and Anil Kumble chased down a total for India



I don't think anything can match these memories.  Me! Just lost interest when all the players I grew up watching retired. Also new players kind of seem more interested in fashion and mostly copying Kohli :/ Probably will be downvoted. But I did stop watching after Sachin retired. I just couldn't...  I stopped being invested when Sachin retired.



The problem with today's Cricket is lack of fierce bowlers or bowling friendly pitches.
Everyone wants to see sixes and teams scoring 200 in 20 overs.


The golden era of McGrath,Warne,Lee,Waqar,Wasim..


Sachin struggling it out on a brutal Perth pitch was more satisfying  than the flat pitch bullying we get to see these days. I was a little interested in cricket earlier.. most of it was because of my brother and father.  
I actually really got into T20 in the initial years during my college days, with full local team support and everything. Went to matches and screenings and stuff, even bought merchandise.  

After a few auctions when favourite players got transferred, I realised how pointless it is to follow it any more. It could just be random groups of players playing with each other. So I completely crashed out of IPL.. I don't even know which teams all the major players play for right now.. Hell, I am sure I can't even name all the teams now. I was never a fan of the excess glamour.. the cheer leaders, the branded 4s and 6s and timeouts, the stupid post innings shows, but the lack of a good consistent team to follow was just too much for me. Along with IPL, I stopped watching cricket completely.  

The last full match I watched was the world cup final in 2013.  I second each and every word of this, I totally lost interest in cricket after retirement of Ganguly, Sachin, Dravid. Now watching cricket feels like time waste to me but previously I used to watch test match for entire day. Last time I was following cricket was in 2011 WC I guess.  I quit watching it like a madman the day Tendulkar quit. I still watch it but bc without Tendulkar kuch jamta nahi hai aajkal.  man, the eyesore of advertisements, there's not one moment while watching the IPL that you're not seeing an ad.  I am a huge cricket fan. I gave up ODIs around ages ago (didn't even watch the World Cup India won) & I never started watching T20s/IPL. I watch only Test cricket - I have even woken up early in the morning to watch Eng-Aus tests.   

 I follow the scores of test cricket involving India and watch worldcup matches involving India. I don't watch IPL, since it doesn't make any sense to me. I would have probably watched it if atleast the teams represented the cities they are named after. At the moment apart from the name and home matches there is nothing in the teams that represents the city. Any one can buy any team, any team can buy any player, the players have no choice which team they would like to play for (Even protitutes can choose which client they would like to serve, but not our IPL players who have to always play for the highest bidder). In the end it ends up like a random distribution of players playing for different team, and this distribution is disturbed periodically and some teams become totally unrecognisable from their previous composition. All this makes the whole exercise look completely unappealing and pointless to me. I was a big cricket fan growing up, played for my school as well and I literally quit watching it after IPL started, followed it for a bit but it all just seemed too contrived and dare I say...fixed.

Cricket was at a point of time only played in the test match format, ODI's were the 20/20's of back then. ODI's killed test cricket and 20/20's will kill ODI's. Cricket is not a gentleman's game anymore, it is an everyman's game and the everyman wants entertainment more than a display of strategy, skill or endurance.

I doubt you would find even one old school fan of the game that will say that 20/20 has had a positive impact on the sport.

Point is - like it or not, cricket has changed and will continue to change. Either cut your losses and move on or adapt. I started watching cricket again after I came back to India a few years ago. Had totally quit before that.  ITT Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. Virat and Anushka are ruining cricket. Just think about it. ITT: Everything changed when the /r/cricket nation attacked... I stopped watching Cricket after 2012. It was when college started for me. It was also the generation change Period when our old fav cricketers in India were retiring. For me cricket at its best will forever remain Sachin, Laxman, Ganguly, Sehwag, Zaheer, Harbhajan, Yuvraj, Dhoni all playing together trying to climb the to the throne, struggling hard against the mighty Australians (early-mid Ponting era), India Pak Bilateral series (Inzaman Hulq era), those feisty Natwest series.

In a way T20 may have played a role and looking  at it now I think T20 did play a role in ruining my affection for the game because my fav moments are still almost fully ODIs or Test. I was an avid Football viewer from the very start but my intrest picked up from 2008 onwards and by 2010 replaced Cricket. 2011 WC was the exception and after India won that it was like I seen it all. 
 Stopped following when we lost in 2003  Whoever asked you to watch the T20s I love cricket and have not missed a single Indian test match session for the past 5 years, have mostly watched every ODI but did not even bother to watch the T20 WC and have not watched IPL after the first 3 seasons. Every person has one's own taste if you feel you are overwhelmed take a step back and watch only the formats or the series that excite you it help a lot in keeping the hype up. P.S. watch the tests in SA and then decide if they were not the best cricket you have seen in over a year. Too much of anything is not good as they say. Have lost the touch at all. Lost interested the day ipl started for exact same reasons I last saw India win the world cup with dhoni as captain Agreed with you 100% on every point.
I just can't sit and watch IPL like I used to, once. Sometimes I just tune in, but for some reason I only enjoy watching at the end of the match when it's close, especially, and watching the first innings has begun to feel kinda inconsequential to me. Idk why. 

And yes, the club culture is stupid. I don't know why people even support teams which shuffle their players every time. They're just representing the cities in name. All of this is just money and business. And don't get me started on players being sold like slaves. It's highly disrespectful to iconic players who go unsold just because they're past their prime and won't be an economically feasible.

Lol this turned into a rant. Thanks for reading though I fucking love cricket and enjoy every second of it. T20 is the future and only feasible way to globalise the game. Advertising brings money to the game and reverting to the old days when there was basically no money in the game is stupid. How would you incentivise youngsters to take the game if they won‚Äôt earn good money from it?Bowlers do get short end of the stick in Shorter formats to a degree, but they have developed new skills to cope and things have gradually evened out to a degree. See the current best bowlers in IPL who‚Äôre mostly Indian and doing exceptionally well economy wise and taking wickets. Paying for hotstar? It‚Äôs a service and you need to pay for it. Stop being entitled. Also if you go premium, hotstar has dugout which has no adds and in-depth cricket discussion.  Nice Rant, and true Cricket: One of the biggest scan in India.  [removed] Overcommercialization of T20 has been the reason for my subdued interest in IPL. ( Although it has been improved this year). What bugs me the most in not the ads on the T-Shirts but those fucking strategic time outs. Ghanta strategy is discussed. Bland and heavily biased commentary also doesn't help. 

Unfortunately the dominance of the willow is staying here. No way ICC are changing the rules or limiting the bat sizes or whatever to take the advantages enjoyed by the batsmen. Indian people prefer 4s and 6s and the ICC is catering to their demands. As simple as that. Dry pitches in England and Australia (WACA is no more a bouncy track) are a testimony to that. I feel that the moment fast pitches come back, our team will fold. And so will the ICC revenues. Like 2007 ODIS world cup

It will take decades for any other sport to displace cricket in India. But the passion for the game is slowly fading, if not spiraling. Me and several friends in my group did. Too much cricket is one of the reasons. Ipl was fun in the beginning but became quite boring with constant shuffles and corruption/cheating.  I stopped watching cricket as soon as the BCCI arm twisted the ICL and delegitimized it only to start its own shamefully glamorous and 'legitimised' IPL.

As a person who absolutely loved the idea of league cricket and has foremost respect for innovation, the decay of cricket governance, the scams that followed and the cheap 'glamorisation' with fashion shows, after parties and foreign cheerleaders made me lost faith in the game.

I have not watched a single cricket match since, barring World Cup finals.  These days, the only sport I watch once in a while is badminton. Fun to watch and easy to support. Also, india is doing pretty good in this sport as of recent. Good points, OP.

Also : In a country like India where we have an impending water crisis, IPL is only making the conditions worse. I can't watch cricket anymore. Even though team India is dominating the scene, I can't even be bothered to catch a game. Unless it's WC or some really big match I stay away. Full disclosure: I've caught the football bug, and now follow it religiously I don't remember the last time I watched a full cricket match, whether T20 or ODI or Test. It's been around eight years since I stopped watching test cricket. The last time I saw a full ODI match was in 2015 Australia vs India world cup semi finals. Not that I had been watching full matches prior to that, I watched that because we friends mass bunked the college to watch it. Being a football addict, cricket feels so boring to me.  nope I fucking love cricket more now. more competitive overseas tours, better indian fast bowlers, this is easily the best ipl season in terms of competitiveness and close games, more test matches on pitches that aren't roads, tatti associate teams are televised, PSL is still a sucks, life is good. 

I look forward more to t20 blast in summer at the oval and other summer test games rather than tottenham games at WHL/wembley I have stopped watching cricket for God knows how many years, ever since all these corruption scandals I get the impression IPL is less a sport than manufactured entertainment. More like the WWE than the Olympics. I can barely watch a complete match on tv. I totally agree.
What IPL & other T20 tournaments around the world are doing is just commercializing the sport.
I think they have capitalised on the short attention span of today's generation & turned cricket into an advertisements & money minting gimmick. 
For a true fan of the game, Test cricket will always remain the true test of grit & character.
It's shameful that someone as undeserving as Jaidev Unadkat get paid more than twice as Cheteshwar Pujara who in my view is the best test palyer in our current squad.
 Watch IPL matches where my hometown team plays, but that's basically it. 

I just watch esports now (And some football in-between), it's not for everyone but the fact that there is constant action for like an hour without no interruptions like Ads.
 Stopped exactly when IPL started.

Too much saturation; no hype. The opposite happened with me. I lost interest after all the retirements of the greats.

Gained interest when I watched the SA test series which was just gold

Now I obsess over it again To be true I have stopped watching any conventional sports except for the fifa world cup. Most of that time is now spent watching eSports (csgo scene).
 Me This change within me happened after Sachin retired, I was a huge fan of him. I am not sure if he was the reason but slowly and steadily I got bored of cricket. This was the time of the T20 craze too so maybe this might be the reason in my case too.  I stopped watching completely after we won the World cup. The cricketers I watched growing up have all retired and gone (Dada, Sachin, Zaheer, Yuvraj, Dravid, Kumble,Srinath etc), never could make that emotional connect with the new breed. And yes IPL and your other arguments as well dragged me away. I have stopped watching cricket. But I know a lot of people who haven't, and follow it with same vigour which I had back in 2003 and 2007.
I guess it is not a general trend, losing interest in cricket. I have. Completely. And I am bewildered by this phenomenon. I believe IPL in south africa was best. We need IPL to be held in bowling friendly tracks for being more fun.

We can go for one far and one home way.

2019) Aus/NZ

2020) India

2021) Europe (Other than england, we can try getting some other countries too like we did few T20 matches in USA)

2022) India

2023) USA/Canada/West Indies

2024) India I am also of the same opinion. Gone are the days when we used to remember name of almost every cricketer from all teams, Period from early 80s till 2010 was a great fun to watch. Now a days, bowlers are getting paid to get hammerred by batsman. Hitting 4s and 6s has become very easy. Badly missing genuine bowling attack of Walsh, Ambrose, Marshall, Garner, Croft, Holding, Shoaib, Waquar, Vasim Akram, Alan Donald, Darren Gough, Guillespie, MacGrath, Shawn Pollock, Brett Lee, Murlidharan, Shane Warne. 

As far as Indian side is concerned, do we really now have talent like Tendulkar, Sehwag, Dravid, Ganguly, Srinath, Zahir, VVS Laxman? I dont think so. The old era of world cricket was far much better. One Day and Test matches should only be the options for Cricket ! IMO rooting for any team in any sport is not rewarding enough to make up for the time it takes.  I don't know I'm in the minority but I find cricket boring. I haven't seen any matches or played any since 2nd or 3rd grade. I was born in Mumbai suburbs just after Indian won it‚Äôs first World Cup. By the time I started understanding cricket, Sachin Tendulkar had just started hitting centuries in ODIs. Cricket interest was ripe around me and I literally played cricket every day. In summer holidays, that was the only thing we did. Play cricket, watch cricket, repeat. Food and sleep were distractions.

As I grew up I often heard how ODI is ruining cricket and how test cricket is the best contest between bat and ball. ODIs won nonetheless. They were being watched and followed way more than test cricket.

Around the same time, I grew interest in football (thanks to my college buddies) and then I realised how cricket requires way less amount of athletic skill, strategic thinking and teamwork. How cricket is a long game with most of the time spent on recovering the ball to bowler, arranging the fields, changing the sides of pitch, etc. Only thing that you require more while playing cricket is patience. I immediately started liking football. This is just my own opinion, don‚Äôt take it personally.

After that, I started getting (mostly watching and discussing) into other sports like badminton, tennis, formula 1, hockey. Any sport that I compared with cricket, cricket looked much weaker of a sport.

I still like to watch cricket as it was my first love. But I respect other games way more.

As T20s came along, cricket was made more intense. People who initially liked a slow paced, patient contest between bat and ball disliked the new format to some extent. Increased intensity and quickness of results got wider audience into the game. Argument about bat domination has been around since ages and is not new to T20. Cricket has always been a batsman‚Äôs game. I gave up watching Cricket when my interest in football rose. I find football way more interesting and fun.  I was also a huge cricket fan. I could tell you about every player of each team. I loved the romanticism of the game. I liked a fair fight between the bat and ball. I used to read cricket literatures. However, when I saw the game changed gradually from epic battles to bollywood style action flicks, I lost my interest.
 As many of people pointed out overcomercialization and some match fixing scandals I have given up on cricket now its Just entertainment before this people used to fight cry and rejoice nowadays it's nothing. From watching five day test matches on tv during exams season, to missing the India Pakistan final match last year, I've come a long way. I think last season when the IPL got over one of the top comment on reddit was "" finally this chutiyap is over "". I think everyone grows out of it eventually. Yeees yes, excellent. Come over to my side. Let the hatred flow through you. I got tired of T20 matches in 9th standard. Now, I hate all forms of cricket. What's üèè cricket?
The game that Hansie Cronje fixed?

Haven't watched a single game since then.

Playing once in a while is enjoyable though. I stopped watching cricket after INDIA's world cup win in 2011.

2nd of April we win, 8th of April we start IPL.  SIX DAYS you get to celebrate the world cup win... SIX FUCKING DAYS.

That's the prime reason you know and remember the 1983 win better than 2011, even if you weren't even born then..

ASSHOLES PREMIER LEAGUE. Not a single match tracked after that.  I am not a sports-tv-watcher by any means. However, I used to watch India vs Other-country matches, and the first t20 world cup was very fun. I loved it but after that I dont remember watching much of the sports except watching it once in a while when someone else keeps it.

IPL has NEVER interested me in any way. I don't see the point of watching few random players of different countries playing on different teams. Who am I supposed to root for? Ranji trophy at least made some sense, but this thing is meaningless. I lost interest after this T-20 came into picture.  Short answer, YES. I am one of them. I the last time I remember following cricket was 2011 world cup. Followed cricket religiously during school and college days like most fans. Watched anything cricket that was on Star Sports. Read reports on different newspapers everyday. Transitioned to cricinfo with same enthusiasm and continued for a number of years. Slowly lost interest and I dont follow each and every series. I still see the news on cricinfo but do not spend a lot of time. Have not matched a live match in the last 5-6 years. Retirements of the cricket greats like Sachin/Lara and a few others also contributed to this in addition to work/family. Since 2014 have transitioned to tennis and now actively follow Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Feel like this is kind of the same thing as following Sachin & Lara.  Dunno about others but I was a religious cricket follower. But in the past 4-5 years have lost interest. This current Indian team does not excite me anymore. I feel no passion. I have shifted my interest to other sports tbh I quit cricket when IPL started. It's pure business now.  Yes, after 2005. Lazy mans game. I prefer even WWE over it despite being scripted. #me2 Lost interest in IPL completely in 2014, when I started preparation for JEE. Ever since then I simply couldn't get into it. I do check out the score when it comes up accidentally while I'm going through all the channels, but that's all. It had lost its appeal IMO. Stopped watching post Sachin retirement 90s kid here. I grew up watching, playing and obsessing with cricket. I stopped watching cricket after around 2012 after all the major cricketers I grew up watching retired and IPL was churning out year after year. My dad used to love the T 20 and I hated it. Around the same time it was Sir Alex Furgeson's last season and the media covered it a lot and I started digging more into football, and ever since then my alligence has permanently shifted from cricket to football. People who actually loved the very core essense of cricket would never buy the concept of 20-20. Its like asking the players and fans to start the match with steroids. Fuck tactics, lets just hit everything. I honestly, dont understand nor appriciate the sport of cricket and its fans anymore. Today I feel like, even a boring football match has more to offer than a 400 run 20-20 IPL match. Its football for me all the way. Manchester United for life.  Started losing interest in cricket once Dravid, Laxman, Sachin, Ganguli and Kumble started retiring.

IMO Kohlis, Rohits... don't have that charm... and cricket does not interest me anymore.

May be I'm too old. sigh. Gave up after Dhoni retired from One Day matches. Not that I watched cricket only for Dhoni. & IPL was never able to create that level of Excitement. I stopped watching after my favourite batsman was caught fixing matches. It was back in the 90's - 2000's. Nothing emotional or anything. I just stated equating cricket to WWF - fake tv shows. Lost all interest in watching games. Since the time I started focusing on studies and gym, sports cut out. I was never excited for cricket except World cup \(coz it matters to people around me\). Nowadays honestly it mostly for the people who have/wants average life \(just my opinion\). I stop talking to people who just talk about matches and don't mostly have anything else to share.

I don't hate sports, I just dislike Cricket coz it don't have any positive effect on anybody its mere a thing to discuss for people. Well if you into sports then you should watch ""Hajime no ippo"" It encourage me to try my best at gym. I am gonna be honest here. I stopped watching cricket when most of the great players of the legendary Steve Waugh-led Australian team retired. It seems that the Indian team is too dominant now. There's no real competition.",Sports,2018-05-02 18:56:45
"After Sunil Chhetri's appeal to fans, tickets to tonight's game are sold out!",1048,8ogfmd,https://i.redd.it/mttddyltvy111.png,70,,darmyster," Star Sports will broadcast the 2018 Intercontinental Cup (India) on Star Sports 2. It will also be streamed live on Hotstar and Jio TV[5].

From 2018 Intercontinental Cup Wiki. Hope people don't shout MC BC during the match. Yeah the atmosphere was insane tonight.. The crowd showed up and the team put on a show. Amazing experience! I hope our captain never has to make a heartbreaking plea like that ever again! Thank you Mumbai! this is a great moment for football in India if you keep aside ISL. Got to say this is a massive fucking eye opener.

I didn't know it had gotten viral to this extent.

 It's all great for this game. It's good to show support but I can't help but think if it's like when a video goes viral on reddit and everybody watches it but then nobody comes back to see another video. 

We don't want one time fans, but regular people to show up and that can only be done by sadly adding some Masala to entice Indian audience. 

Other sports need a Sachin, Dhoni or another Bhutia will also do. That can only happen if government or organization supports them enough.  Good thing he came out openly to connect with fans. Hope this will spur up and upward trend in our footballing scenes. Thanks India. Why are they playing in Mumbai instead of Kerala or northeastern India?  Tbh, I don't disagree with a single word of sunil. I being a Chelsea fan do take interest in football. But till that day, I didn't really take much interest in Indian football. And those words were an eye opener. I did feel ashamed. And I should be.

"PSA: Don't pay for Hotstar Premium, It's utter crap waste of money.",355,8dmqhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8dmqhs/psa_dont_pay_for_hotstar_premium_its_utter_crap/,242,"I don't know why Indian companies still can't do decent tech. 

I wanted to watch a couple of shows (The mick, Modern Family) so I decided to pay for Hotstar premium rather than torrenting. 

I already have prime and Netflix, so why not? I thought.  Just within 24 hours I am hoping I had not bought it and just gone with torrents. 

**Reasons WHY you should not get Hotstar Premium**

* Just one screen! If someone is watching it on my tv, I can't watch something else on the laptop. 

* Stream speed is so bad. It constantly goes into buffering.

* Lags, the videos will suddenly start lagging for no apparent reason.

* UI is just a giant mess (Why Can't No Indian Company Do Good UI! It's like they don't even know what it means!)

* No next episode button on the player, this is the stupidest thing, there isn't a next episode button in the video player.

* Suddenly mid-show it will get stuck and then I will have to refresh and reload the entire thing.

* There is no progress bar, Like the previous point when your video gets stuck, you have to guess where it left off. 

All in all, I wasted my 1000 bucks for a year subscription. And I know it's not a lot of money but still, Consumers speak with there wallets, And so it would be better if no one else wasted their money on it and encouraged them.

Peace!

Edit:2 more things By Anku94

* (Still) uses Flash DRM, in this day and age. Which means it doesn't work on Linux and all.

* Previous history and all are stored locally. So if you watch a TV series on one device and want to continue on the other, search for that TV show again, try to recall which episode you last watched, and navigate their stupid UI to get to the next episode.",stupidarg," [deleted] I bought Hotstar premium about a year ago and shared my account with some friends and family. But since it was usable on 1 screen only, I was not able to use it properly. 

I thought I'll just change my password and logout of all devices. But there was no option to do so. I already knew hotstar's tech was not good, so I thought well alright I'll just contact customer support and tell them to do it. When I contacted the customer support, they told me to fucking deactivate my account make a new one with a different email ID and resubscribe. That day I got to know that they were not just incompetent technically, they didn't value their customers and their subscriptions as well.

[Screenshot ](https://i.imgur.com/JT544GN.jpg) But it is the only place to watch The Premier League. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ Hotstar is dogshit. Half their site does not even use https. If you have extensions like ublock origin and duckduckgo privacy essentials enabled, you cannot watch any content(on browser) even if you have premium subscription. It's a shame because they have rights to some great content. To add,

1. (Still) uses Flash DRM, in this day and age. Which means it doesn't work on Linux and all.

2. Previous history and all are stored locally. So if you watch a TV series on one device and want to continue on the other, search for that TV show again, try to recall which episode you last watched, and navigate their stupid UI to get to the next episode. Hotstar is utter shit. Putting aside all the things op said and dirty business tactics, I don't know who coded it but they sure don't understand why premium and non-premium content needs to be filtered at server-side and not client-side. On the opposite side, their content to cost ratio is impressive beating Netflix/Prime by a large margin. I only use it to watch HBO stuff and almost always on Chromecast and it works fine. I did notice the stream is much higher quality on Chromecast than watching directly on a computer.

It‚Äôs terrible from a UI perspective and the website works like ass but it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre only ever going to cast stuff to your TV. Its Indian just for namesake, in the end, all the money goes to 21st Century Fox (it owns Star India) which will soon be owned by Disney. Check your speed to hotstar servers : t1.re   
  
Isn't prime 1 screen too?    I paid 1k for the whole year. IPL alone makes it worth it I'm surprised. My experience is very different from yours. I bought the sports pack (299/year) and have had no issues with lags or buffering. Maybe you should check your browser/flash for updates. What is your connection speed? I have only had it freeze once or twice a month (when using hotstar free). Also, the episodes are listed underneath the video, so I don't see a major problem (a nuisance, nonetheless)

As for the multiple screens, I have logged in on three devices at a time and have watched 2 games simultaneously on 2 different devices. Maybe i am just lucky? Or you probably should be on the same wifi network to use it on multiple devices at the same time.  I actually enjoyed a lot of shows on Hotstar. Even when my premium expired, I was able to enjoy classic shows like ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""Futurama"".

And it almost never buffered for me. I think you should try and check whether your ISP is giving you the speeds he promised. A lot of ISPs in major cities are not up to the mark. Mine gives me good speeds on every domain. This might be an issue for you \- maybe your ISP has throttled streaming websites in your area.

And I actually don't have an issue with the UI either, but yeah, it's not as glitzy as Netflix. But it's still pretty ok.

The biggest plus\-point is that it is so much more affordable than Netflix and Prime.

I do not think it's a waste of money, and actually is very worth it. Huh it's UI is pretty good a fuck lot batter than Amazon prime Android app. Hotstar is run by Star India, it is definitely not a startup, rather I'd say its a monopoly, even if a startup were to make a competing product against them, they own the rights to many exclusive shows which they sure as fuck aren't gonna hand over to a startup so unfortunately nothing much can be done about it. This is one of the reasons monopolies work against innovation > Just one screen! If someone is watching it on my tv, I can't watch something else on the laptop.
Necessary otherwise it will be misused.

And their website still uses Adobe Flash Player lol. I love hotstar... rather my kids do... they have a ton of animated movies...

But fuck me in the ass if I ever want to see all the movies listed based on there genre...   Is there any other way to legally watch modern family, silicon valley, game of thrones, ipl etc etc etc? They also have a big fucking annoying hotstar watermark on premium contents. I don't think I'll be renewing my subscription next time. But there is no better way to watch sports especially EPL. Even though sometimes they ""forget"" to telecast matches... all other free streaming links are slowly being taken down There is something called hotstarlivestreamer which can help in streaming the video via VLC. LPT: If you don't want to pay for Hotstar. Signup with a new ID. The first month is free. Cancel it before it expires otherwise you will be charged. Then use create another account with some other email ID and the same credit card. Enjoy next month free. Repeat till their policy changes.  Go for netflix My laptop gets really heated up while watching hotstar, justifying its name of hot-star. Took it mostly for Silicon Valley and modern family for 1200, regretting now. They recently boasted about their high QPS during IPL. Also have been advertising heavily about their software job openings on a lot of platforms. Definitely big time scope of improvement. Somebody help me. So i dont have hotstar subscription. But how am i able to watch Premier League games?? Confused! Actually I don't have most of the problems you mentioned. 
It works fine and doesn't lag and buffering is also fine.
Yes it lacks a next episode button and a fee things and the UI sucks.
I also don't use an app.

The problem I have is different. When I was using the app there was a clear skip in frames. And on bluetooth the audio and video don't match. I've gotten on call with the hotstar guys before and they couldn't fix it.

On chrome, I keep getting errors for some content. Like whenever I watch something that is not premium, it just stops and gives me a error code. 

I also got a discount - 600 bucks for the year Amazon has both Office and Parks and Rec, Rewatching for the 6th time, still no Ragrets. Sports package is absolutely worth it!  >1000 bucks for a year subscription

Always pilot before go live. But.. But.. It has all the HBO originals..  I enjoyed all the comments and arguments here, but I dont have a dog in the fight as I torrent each and everything I want to watch. Thanks for this. Was thinking about subscribing to the year package. Spent some time browsing through their premium library but didn't find anything that interested me. Amazon Prime is a much better deal.
And I am surprised how fast they keep updating their catalogue.



Hotstar's streaming platform is inconsistent and they charge a lot more than the quality of service they provide.
 Its fine. Have been using it since October 2017. Never had a problem with the UI. You get what you pay for so meh.  > just within 24 hours

Should not you first used it for free for a month ? But.. I can watch IPL for free!! The mick is hard to get on seeds on torrent. Season 2 ending is serious. Doesn't hotstar have something like fast.com to check speed?  I subscribed 5-6 months back based on a recommendation here - It was at a discounted price - 600Rs, I think.  

Their content there is not as good as Prime. I have watched a few shows there (Billions, Last Man Standing, The Mick etc) & also watched a few movies. But overall, it's not really worth even 600 Rs - especially compared to Prime.

I have never had any buffering or any other problem - though. I watch it only on the laptop.   And they put stupid hoardings asking for people to join their development team. Yeah their dev team is shit.  I too had the same experience with shitstar. To add further to these points, Cast option is a horrible mess. Subtitles won't work if you cast. Can't even watch at the lowest video quality without the video buffering every 10 second (while I can stream full HD in Netflix at the same connection) I was lucky that I opted only for the monthly subscription. And while cancelling the subscription, I had to chat with tech support for over an hour to get it done. With this kind of competition, no wonder Netflix price is so damn high.(Prime is good too but as long as they don't add cast option, they're gonna lose out people like me)  I use hotstar premiun only for watching clssic hbo shows. I subscribed to their sports package recently. One of the worst premium services I paid. FUCK HOTSTAR. Indian sites/apps that have great ui- cleartrip, Ola, BookMyShow, paytm and so on. 
I have similar ui grievances with hotstar (no tv app either), but with the sports/shows it gives me access to, I've not had cable/dish TV for over a year now and better without it. Hope Hotstar PMs taking notes Single screen issue is a big one but other than that I'm happy with it.

Being able to stream HBO Originals is something great. Agree with all your points. Especially about frequent buffering, although that happens less now compared to 2-3 months back. The shitty UI, urrgh! 

Anyway, Hotstar does have great content, although licensed from HBO, Showtime etc. None if those shows are available on Netflix or Prime Video and never will.

I think the rationale behind this is clear. Most American media companies, in this case HBO etc don't consider Hotstar a legit competitor, which is true, you can discern that from the whole Product experience. So their thinking is that, lets make money off of Hotstar buy charging them hefty(my guess) licensing fees. In most cases, they are always hefty. If and when they do enter the Indian market, they will obviously have a better product and the same or more content. 

Then they can either pull their programming from Hotstar or charge more in licensing fees. Either way, its game over for Hotstar.

The unfortunate reality is that this is far, far into the future. Companies like HBO, Hulu etc aren't even remotely interested in markets like India so Hotstar gets rights to their shows for the foreseeable future. Till then we need to make a tradeoff between torrents or Hotstar, Its at least better than torrents, thank god. https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Overview/Working-at-Hotstar-EI_IE1465942.11,18.htm#trends-overallRating

Their rating on glassdoor is 2.7 right now but used to be 4.5+ mid last year, which is around the time when they raised $192M in funding. Happens with so many startups which raise money and then screw everything up. Terrarium ftw. I agree. I couldn't watch half the stuff as my internet guy had a transparent proxy. It gave me an IP in Japan/US.

Tech couldn't fix it. So this is my experience with Hotstar. If you are a Tata Sky subscriber, you would know you can watch TV on your mobile through their app. Everything was fine but as soon as the shit-hole IPL started, the Tata Sky app started redirecting me to download Hotstar to watch any of the channels from the Star Sports pack. What a shitty way to force people into downloading an app deliberately. So now I am forced to keep two apps, one solely for watching English Premier League, and one for watching anything else. The worst part? Force-updating the Hotstar app whenever there‚Äôs an update.  i know its an old post . but i want to comment that hotstar truly is pathetic.

i just discovered it is censoring things (online streaming? really)

modern family is censored. nonsense!!  Works fine on the Android mobile app for me. Sure, your post is 5 months old so that must have made a difference. It remembers where I left off and starts the next episode in 10 seconds. So yeah, getting a Hotstar Premium has been beneficial for me because they have rights to some great content. All the HBO stuff- GOT, Veep, Silicon Valley etc, X files, Modern Family, Patrick Melrose, and now Friends too. I like it when I have to torrent as less as possible.  I face the same issues with HotStar. And I can't believe they have not fixed simple things like next episode button and the point at which a particular video was stopped. These are some of the quick fixes that they can do to get even with the competition.
 Also along  with complaining here, send a mail to:  hello@hotstar.com   
  
Last time when this happened they added 1080p and remembering episodes you watched server side. If it wasnt for how bad the app is, I would have considered paying to watch EPL matches, but now I have to resort to illegal 3rd party apps to watch them, even though they suck.  Not to mention its basically scamming ppl taking the sports package, does not include F1, says this after you pay and IPL is only HD 720p even that lags like a bitch. 

Absolutely no reason to pick Hotstar. All are valid points but...

>* UI is just a giant mess (Why Can't No Indian Company Do Good UI! It's like they don't even know what it means!)

Flipkart has better UI Than Amazon, and its not like India lacks the creative genius its just most companies don't emphasize on it or don't see or test from customer perspective The complaints here for the price are hilarious. I pay 40,000inr/yr for premier league, F1 and Cricket in UK.  It seems more like there is a problem with your internet connection or something. I have never had a buffering problem with hotstar. Maybe you have some extension that is malfunctioning on this site?

You say UI sucks. It's subjective and I think its okay not that bad. And the other complaints like it  works only on one device, no lixus are simply ignorant. It's your responsibility to check that. They are not cheating here. Netflix provides those features doesn't mean you can assume everyone will provide them. You get what you pay for. Compare netflix and hotstar costs. They are doing what they can. 

It seems like shitting on India and Hinduism is a trend that is never going to leave randia.  Why the fuck would you pay for any media in india? entertainment is not accounted for at all in any salary so fuck it steal whatever you can",Sports,2018-04-20 19:06:02

Not only that, they have ruined cricket coverage with lots and lots of ads. 

England series, Australia series and world cup are on Sony.

Edit: world cup is on star but you get the drift. Money. Apparently Sony is charging Tata sky more money than some other dth providers. Thats all the info I have Sporting event rights should be sold to multiple channels, so that they ll strive to provide a good viewing experience. Sony has absolutely terrible coverage of cricket but they have no incentive to improve it as viewers are forced to watch through the shit broadcast.  Sony is being asshole and using its platform to convince people that the other party is wrong. Has AXN and FX India been removed from Tata sky too? And they wonder why people go with piracy.  Sony wants to increase their prices. If they get it done, other channels will ask for the same. At least Sony has that much content to prove their value but doubtful with others. Tata Sky knows, hike in prices means disgruntled customers. Plus, competition among DTH is tight. Can i get a refund for my sports pack? Has anyone tried?

1. Nissan Micra CVT XL, except ground clearance everything is great. I have test drive it and I like the feel of CVT.
2. Nexa Ignis delta AMT : Ground clearance is excellent. Rear side look of the car is bad. and its AMT
3. Grand i10 Magna MT: Except for standard looks. i like this too.

&#x200B;

All above models have ABS/ Dual airbags etc., price is also similar right now. around 6.5 Lakhs.

Kindly help deciding.

Edit: At this point I don't care about cosmetic features. basic sound system is good enough for me. which is available in all the above.

Update 1: I have shortlisted Hyundai Santro AMT sportz and Grand i10 Sportz. both are same price. Grand i10 has significant additional features(mostly cosmetic, except engine, alloy wheels, passenger side airbag, like rail roof, spoilers)  compare to Santro. But I am confused to go for AMT to let go those features.  Any suggestions?

Update 2: End up buying used Micra XV cvt. Thanks everyone.  ",n_end," You can also look in the used market. You can get a practically new car , 12 months or less, for a 25% discount, which would bring options like Honda jazz cvt or Amaze cvt within your budget. I bought grand i10 sportz auto last year.

According to the data and stats by Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) India, PKL was pegged to be the popular non-cricket property with season 4 contributing to 61 per cent of the total viewership share among the leagues other than IPL.

Kabbadi has become the second most popular sport in India in no time after living in infancy for several decades despite being an indigenous sport to India.

Idli, dosa, chapati, upma, bread, oats , eggs


IIFYM I skip it. I do scuffed IF and only eat between 1-9 pm 2 slices of bacon and two eggs. 

 I do omad , lost 30 kgs Boiled eggs, omlette, oats, chocolate milk, bananas, sprouts, poha, upma, sandwich pretty much covers most of my breakfast items. 50 gram oats with 15 egg whites with butter, roughly 62 grams protein. Breakfast is honestly the most important meal. I‚Äôve had days where I‚Äôve skipped breakfast and spent the rest of the day either very hungry or too full. 

I stick to boiled eggs, a simple omelette, poha, corn flakes, bananas or Upma. Sets me up nicely for the day, and I am in control of my intake all day.  2 eggs, cheese (not amul processed cheese, the local good stuff) and a giant cup of coffee, a small piece of any seasonal fruit 6 egg whites and 1 ~~yoke~~  yolk Oats/ paratha....  Get rolled oats, (not the instant quacker ones). Put a cup of oats (about 30-40 grams) in a jar/container, add double the milk, Put one tablespoon chia seeds, can add bit of yogurt too of you want. Leave it overnight in fridge.


In the morning, add a tablespoon of honey as sweetener, please avoid sugar. Add 20-30 grams muesli for crunchyness. If your muesli doesn't have nuts then you can keep a few almonds /cashews /raisins in overnight kept oats.


Add any fresh fruits, cut a Banana and add, apples, mango, just anything.


- you can add a scoop of whey of you want but since I like my oats bland so don't want to spoil their taste with double rich chocolate whey.

- the muesli i have has bits of almonds and raisins so I skip the nuts.

- prep time : 2 mins in the night. (just have to add oats, chia and milk)

About 5 in the morning (add honey, mix, add muesli, cut fruits)  Pesarattu, oats upma, idli Chaat, veggies with air fried peanuts, paneer sandwich, chana and potato fritters/cutlets, mango oats on sundays. If I don't have time before work I have peanut butter sandwich and veggies.  4 eggs (omelet nowadays, add onion, capsicum, tomato and other vegetables), used to eat a curd + oats + almonds mix, lassi, walnuts, some fruit like banana or mango. This is after I wake up drink lemon in hot water, do pranayam, aloe vera + avla juice, half glass of water + turmeric. 20Rs poha :3 rice....5-6 days a week. I wouldn't call myself fit, on my way though (lost 30 kilos and 10 inches from my waist in a year). 

I usually shuffle between idli, dosa (plain and masala), uthappa, upma (bombay rava, wheat rava and semiya), and oats.  Boiled eggs/ scrambled eggs/ poached eggs

Peanut butter banana shake. Half cup oats + half cup water + half cup milk + 1 scoop whey + 1 fruit


Been doing this every weekday for 5+ years now. It's convenient and quick.


On the weekends it's eggs, granola or pancakes depending on the mood.  

any of the following : 

1. 4 chapati, omelette of 2 eggs. 

2. French toast. 

3. Normal toast with omelette of 1/2 eggs. 

4. 1 boiled egg and milk if in a hurry.

5. Oats.  Oats and 2 omelette's (Limited to 2-3 days a week and rest of the days 4-5 egg whites). Sometimes if i'm in the mood, i'll finish my breakfast off with coffee or chocolate shake. Paratha/Bajra roti with egg whites or lentils Bowl of muesli with milk, 4 eggs scrambled, 2 bread with peanut butter and honey, 3 chicken sausages, and 2 bananas.  Eat normal breakfast. Almost all of the men in the Indian Army eat stuff like paratha and eggs  every morning. Almost all of them are really fit.

What matters is that you maintain a balance between how much you eat and exercise,  Alternate between a bowl of oats and cornflakes with milk. No time for a heavy breakfast. Muesli from Oats + 2-3 sliced fruits + Little bit of Milk + half spoon honey + tiny bit of Cinnamon.

Mango Season used to be the best! Right now I'm using Apples, Pear and banana.

These [two goals](https://youtu.be/98jYpcb3TtI) vs JDT in the AFC Cup Semi-final are my favorite.

**Context:** It is the second leg of the AFC Cup semi-final (Europa League equivalent for Asia). No Indian club had ever reached the final. Bengaluru FC are facing JDT, the defending champions and favorites to win this time around too. Bengaluru had already lost to JDT twice, 0-1 and 3-0 in the group stages and managed a 1-1 draw in the 1st away leg of semifinal. Bengaluru had the away goal advantage, they just needed to end the 2nd leg 0-0 and they would be through. They concede in the 11th minute, shit! Now we BFC are losing 1-2 on aggregate. Up steps Chhetri, in the 41', one of smallest guys on the pitch, equalizes with a header, 2-2. The second half is cagey, time is running out and then out of nowhere Chhetri scores that screamer in the 71' and creates history, making BFC the first Indian club to reach the AFC Cup finals. Still, enjoy seeing Alvaro Rubio's reaction to that Chhetri goal.

Its just the mentality. We want to brag to others about how India won a medal in something, but no one wants to put in the effort or support to the athletes involved. And a big reason why, India can never really compete at the highest level in most non cricket sports. Not to take anything away from the athletes, their accomplishments are incredible, even more so being Indian, but India as a whole really doesn't deserve to claim these accomplishments as its own.

A year later, STAR somehow thought of putting Kabaddi on TV which turned out much better than expectation with PKL often topping BARC's charts.

I thought that was it, but then STAR started the Badminton League maybe because of the interest due to good performances by Indian players in Asian Games, CWG and Olympics.

Sony ten seem to cut straight to the advertisements, 30 seconds after the match is finished.
I find it's irritating because today I wanted to see the reactions of the Colombian and Japan players, which wasn't possible. ",blues0," Absolutely wtf is that!! Truly, post match and Pre match shows are absolute shitshow as well.  That's why I use r/soccerstreams.  Please post regarding this on either Twitter or Facebook. I've done so, need more people to do so What's that host's name ? That guy has some cringe lines and always tries to disregard or belittle his guests. 

I feel sorry for David James 
A. Always gets shut out by that oversmart host
B. Can't seem to sit comfortably in that tiny chair they have for him Video quality on Sony liv is horrendous for best quality as well.Why cant they just stream just like UCL ffs If it makes you guys feel any better, I watch the world cup on the FOX network here from the US, and it's infested with ads too. They don't stick around much after the match either.
But afaik the commentary is pretty unbiased [deleted] One good thing about Sony is they are telecasting in their SD channels too, if this is Star then we will get only in their HD channels like EPL matches.  This is nothing. Most of el clasicos, UCL knockout matches and even final also have same fate. We fans will be up till late 2am-3am, after a nail biting win, I want to see players reaction and thanking the fans, but no they cut to advertisement.  I still use Cable (logistical issues) and my Cable guy stopped Sony Ten channels the day World Cup started itself, a few hours before first match. 

Then DD Sports which will show 4 matches total this WC, got switched off 20 minutes in. 

The excuse given every 2 days on calling them, they are in negotiation with Sony on price. 

MOTHERFUCKERS. All of them.  

I am used to Hotstar on account of PL and F1 and expected Sony Liv to be better but it is not really all that great either.  
On casting to Chromecast one has to do multiple re-connects and disconnects otherwise the Audio and Video are out of sync.  
Like what year is this. How hard could that be.  

There is also weird delays in stream start and its random.  

It is a freaking mess. 

Star is Cricket obsessed but at least they know Sports Broadcasting, relatively. 

If it wasn't for FIFA broadcasting guidelines, fuckers like Sony Ten would have adds during a Football match. I can already smell/sense Indian corporate boards who decide such nonsense thinking about it and asking each other as to why is football different to Cricket, why can't they show a 15 second Ad while a player is setting up a Free Kick.  

2006 WC(pre and post match aspects not the actual broadcast which India just takes in totality) was also bad on Star because it had Harsha as Host. He had no freaking clue what he was doing, messed up the vibe by asking ridiculous questions of the experts and then making that silly smile face he often does when he pretends to have some sort of epiphany or something but doesn't speak‚Äî just..hangs there in the same posture, all the while experts Steve McMahon and Gerry Armstrong who would then look confused and embarrassed, it was cringe of the highest order.


India can't do WC even when India isn't even at the WC. I dread what will happen when India does get there.  

Olympics broadcasting got ruined like this. When India was just plain shit at least the coverage was wholesome and more action of other sports could be seen, World Class competition. I get it, most Indians would want to see Indian athletes compete even if its not at the highest level but at least freaking have the option for those who want to watch those other events. 

*Is dekh ko entertainment-media me Ekta Kapoor hi sahi hai, yehi deserving hai*

/rant If you don't follow cricket, you should have seen Sony's coverage of the India vs SA series

Motherfuckers were cutting to ads in-between deliveries

Truly the worst broadcaster. If I know Sony is going to broadcast something, it actively reduces my enthusiasm for it They often miss out on first ball of an over in cricket  because they were showing th ads . 

Their preview shows are generally awful as well(Cricket or football).

Star is so much ahead in terms of quality  Official FIFA app has decent highlights post game reactions, post game interviews etc. I rarely watch pre game shows because i prefer reading it online. Plus Sunil Chhetri might be a good football player but he can hardly string a coherent sentence and its irritating to hear him speak. I agree with OP's reservation as I also felt that when I was waiting for reactions of Mexican players and fans after Germany game and they straightaway switched to ads.

Though a lot of people here seems to be not enjoying Joe Morrison. Morrison has been hosting champions league shows for Ten for over a decade and in the initial years he seemed to get similar flak (the old Orkut days) to the reactions in this thread.

But Morrison kind of changed the game in late 2010 time period when he had regular guests (Carlton Palmer and John Burridge) who engaged  with him in banter. Their not so serious, unconventional pre match programme to Ten Sports was fun to watch. They called each other names and constantly scoffed at each other's tastes.

Morrison's style is pretty different from other conventional hosts you see in Star Sports. He excels in banter but if you have semi-serious guests it often doesn't come across well. 

I feel he works well with someone like Sunil Chettri than with Bhaichung Bhutia, Wes Brown or Garcia.  Also, why do they have single commentator? Hopefully Cable TV will be extinct.

Fuckers are absolutely obnoxious with the ads now more than ever. Stream it on SonyLiv, not as horrendous. Most of us took the 100% cashback offer on their 6 month subscription I have to watch the match on mute because the commentary is so shit, and biased. Commentators taking a team's side as if they are broadcasting a India-Pakistan cricket match.

That aside they are not even showing both the matches.... (at least for me, yesterday they had only argentina vs nigeria and there was no broadcast for the croatia match, same today no tunisia match coverage
) Plus their streaming is sub par. Mine would stop working randomly or freeze, even though I've a decent internet connection.  I head straight to r/soccerstreams and find me a BBC stream for the post match reactions.

I'VE PAID FOR THE PREMIUM SONYLIV SERVICE BUT I STILL HAVE TO USE ILLEGAL STREAMS SMH Utter shit. Can't believe paid for this.  You should come to Australia and take a look at Optus's coverage. I stream it on ITV. UK

British know what football viewers like and dislike. Sony coverage of anything is bad. Blame it on VAR. They've increased match durations and with pre-set time slots and ads being their revenue, they've to cut down something. ",Sports,2018-06-28 23:59:32

The AIFF has even told the IOA that that they‚Äôll take care of all the expenses and yet IOA remains a stupid entity with a myopic view for sports. We have the Asia Cup starting in January next year and still IOA does this bullshit.  Why won't they send them though?  Can someone write up a good whatsapp message which everyone can copy paste and forward it?

The reason they are not sending Indian team is because they think they won't win a medal so ""there is no point in trying"".

This is a ridiculous way of thinking and I can't even believe this is real.

Honestly feel like a post from theonion 
, Holy Shit According to IOA(and what I read from hindustantimes website), only teams/individuals ranked 1-8 in continental level are qualified to represent India in their respective event.The Indian Football teams currently ranks 14th in Asia.

My opinion is that these stupid cunts should realise that competition in football is much tougher(without disregarding the credibility of other sports) and the fact that we managed a respectable rank of 14 alongwith multiple wins and excellent performances is a very valid reason to send the lads to the games.

 Plus, I think this situation is quite similar to the South Korea one.(where players have to serve in military if you don't reach a certain stage in their respective sport.) This happen when Politicians start managing sports authorities... IOA has to decide between sending a squad of ~24 who plan 1 game, vs give chance to ~10-15 other players playing games in which we ""might"" have a chance.

hmm. So by that logic why should we even go to the Olympics?  Where is our leader who congratulate and take credit for success of someone else. It isn't about winning medals for the fucking country! I *hate* sports of all kinds, but god damn I feel for these people who don't even get to participate for a sport they love to play. This reminds me of the movie Chak De India's first half. How those association members make fun, talk bullshit, suggesting to drop it cuz it's waste of time and more importantly it's waste of money.

Insisting they won‚Äôt allow any ‚Äòpassengers‚Äô, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), on Saturday, omitted the men and women‚Äôs football teams from the Asian Games contingent. A senior IOA official said football teams were excluded because they ‚Äòdid not stand a chance to compete for medals‚Äô.

The decision comes as a massive setback to the All India Football Federation (AIFF), who were hoping to use the Asian Games as one of the key tournaments in the build up to next year‚Äôs Asian Cup. Livid with the decision, the AIFF is likely to raise the issue with sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, hoping that the IOA will reverse its stand.

Football is the only high-profile sport which has been omitted from India‚Äôs entry list, which was finalised on Saturday ‚Äì the last day to submit the entries. Football is classified as a priority sport by the sports ministry but a senior IOA official said they were simply sticking to the guidelines set by the government.

‚ÄúGuidelines are in place and we are strictly following them. The football team hasn‚Äôt done well internationally and had no chance of winning medals. So there was no point sending them for the Games,‚Äù a senior IOA official said. ‚ÄúWe are evolving as a sporting nation. In many sports, we are competing for gold medals. In such a scenario, we shouldn‚Äôt send a team merely to compete.‚Äù

ADVERTISEMENT

According to government guidelines, which have been enforced by the IOA as well, only those teams which have achieved ranking up to eighth among nations competing at the Asian Games will be considered for participation. The men‚Äôs team is ranked 97th in the world and 14th in Asia, whereas the women‚Äôs team, placed 60th in the world, are 13th in the continent. These norms have been relaxed in certain cases, but a ministry official insisted they will be strictly implemented on this occasion.

With the Asian Cup barely four months after the Games, it is argued that the Asiad is a necessary exposure for the team. ‚ÄúFootball is easily the most competitive sport in the world. It‚Äôs not easy to be in top eight of the continent and this decision taken by the IOA completely ignores the progress made in the recent years. We will raise the issue with the highest authorities and ensure the participation of our teams,‚Äù an AIFF official said.

This isn‚Äôt the first time football teams were on the chopping block. It was a similar case four years ago but a timely intervention by AIFF president Praful Patel saved the day for them. They went on to lose all their matches, forcing the IOA to take the drastic step of omitting them from the contingent list.

While the interest in the sport is growing exponentially in our country, no doubt, but had the WC been hosted in a country that's on the other side of the globe, just like the last one, the number would've been much lower. lmao this guy loves bragging about football's popularity.

Yesterday he made a post on r/cricket if cricket could ever pass football's popularity. Seemed like instead of getting answer to his question, he was more focused on bragging about football's popularity.

Threw some numbers out without any evidence. Like what he is doing here is as well. Where is the source. Can't make up numbers like that.

Yesterday, he told me soccer had 4 billion fans. That's over 50% of the population. It was funny. Well, World Cups are special. I doubt how many watch I-League or the IFA Shield, or even ISL! Football will never be as popular as cricket in India, unless we

1. Win some major competitions outside Asia
2. Have an Indian play for a major club in Europe.  250 million cumulative viewers* 

 where does the figure ""250 mil"" come from ? That's like a fifth of our population. I find it hard to believe. Could you share your source?

Really good news if it's true. 25 crore seems exaggerated. Tbh with u if t20s weren't invented then football could have probably overtaken cricket at some point soon.

But IPL has just changed previous non cricket fans' perspective towards the game.

The host is a total douchebag, his face just emanates douchebaggery. Sony has always been shit OMG, their green screen set is so shit.  Sony is one of the worst sports channels ever.  
For a generation which grew up on European football with masters like John Dykes, that Joe Footy guy is as bad as the IPL jokers running around talking idiotically.  
Why is he even there? Coz he has a generic white guy face?   
The panel also does not work at all, provide no great insight into the game (partly due to the host being an unfocused idiot), mostly do not have ANY statistical homework done, never show anything other than plain, simple highlights.   


This WC has been one of the best (for viewers) in India and these idiots are out happily ruining the greatest prospect India has for this sport to REALLY take off right now.  
Just take Joe Footy out to the barn and shoot him and get hire Mr Dykes. Hahaha. Agree with you.  David James is such an horrendous expert. Hindi one is nice. They joke and laugh. 50 rupaye me itnaich milega. Agreed. The host is the worst I have seen in a long time Who remembers World Cup 2006's Hindi commentary? For a couple of matches it was the only option.

I still remember the commentator calling Portugal, Po-tu-re-gaal. Haha. Atleast they've come a long way from having John Abraham as a football pundit. The host is an absolute cunt who doesn't give a rat's ass about the show are the viewers. The guests are atrocious, didn't even like Chhetri or Sandhu as pandits. From the guys who brought you John Abraham. Is football mundial still up? I don't have too many complaints about it.  [removed]",Sports,2018-07-03 22:11:04
That time has arrived in urban India when many people suddenly become Football experts.,98,8q7lw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8q7lw7/that_time_has_arrived_in_urban_india_when_many/,71,"The time has come again after 4 years when Indian people suddenly become football experts. They start analyzing the game and decide tactics much better than Pep Guardiola could ever do. Sudden spike in supporters of Brazil and Argentina is seen everywhere. There are also fans of 'wo Ronaldo wala team' and 'Brazil bcoz Ronaldo plays there' seen around colleges and offices.

These people are most amusing to watch when there is TV with match playing around them. They are excited as if they themselves are coaches. 'Arre wo aage ponch gaya tha bus pass nahi diya usko warna goal pakka tha' types of dialogues become common. For people like these teams consist of only 2 type of players, 1 goalkeeper and 10 attackers, 'Defender, wo kaunsa alien hai?'. Any team that has 4 players standing behind while attackers push is the team jisko khelne nahi ata, weak team hai.

'Referee whistle kyu bajaya, foul to nahi hua' is the line you hear when offside happens. Another epic dialogue, 'Ye game itna fast hai, players bhi itne fit hai, isko asli sport bolte hai. Kaha hum bhi cricket dekhte hai' comes from the people who will watch complete ODI in next India vs Sri Lanka tournament the very next day.

I have been seeing these people in offices every 4 years. They are truly amusing. Anyone else experiencing these?",HueLueDue," Stop being elitist snobs and happily welcome the new watchers. Football needs supporters like these to grow. Do you think every cricket fan knows the technicalities of swing, spin and pitch in cricket?

You can enjoy a sport without being an expert. [deleted] I hate post like these. Do you want new people to watch and enjoy the sport or not? Every sport have casual as well as hardcore fans. Casual fans only watch important events , no need to be butthurt about it /r/Gatekeeping is that way. It's the same everywhere, not just Urban India. Even in the US, where a considerable part of the population does not actually enjoy or even understand football, during the Euros and WC, they're all pumped up.  OP I don't understand how this is a problem. There's an interest being generated in the sport. 

How do people learn? 
By asking questions. That's how.

Not everyone was born wearing a Messi jersey like you were at birth. 

I frankly don't mind having more eyeballs on TV if it results in football as a whole capturing the imagination of an entire generation. That's what the 2002 world cup did for me. I was 10.

So STFU with your whining and let live FFS. And of course the patriotic ques:

Q:  ""Why does not India play""...

Ans: Bcz they did not qualify 

Reply : Ah..next WC they would play..bcz of Modi (I heard this in WC 2014). Let it go. Let it go.... Sunil Chhetri > Messi, OK? Though I'm a Cricket fan with minimal knowledge of football.  I watch only FIFA world cup or Copa America where countries play. League/franchise matches don't have that zeal. World Cup is an excitement. That's the same thing that happens during Olympics or Wimbledon finals. I don't really understand that much of Tennis either. In my city, you get the same shit happens with 50-year old pot-bellied people, who hadn't made a proper pass in 35+ years!

And then there's the crowd who can literally give you the names of entire rosters, sometimes by year!

And I just wanna grab a beer and enjoy a nice game of football! Speaking of that, I'm one of these noobs. Don't follow any club football. Used to be really into it but lost touch and now can't be arsed because all my old favorites have retired (I'm from the Ronaldinho generation).

So which players and teams should I watch out for? Well, to be honest, the number of people genuinely interested in the sport are growing. A lot of people often come up to me and ""talk football"" and i end up making a lot of new friends because of this. I always have to control myself from getting too technical about football when talking to them, lest i put them off. 
So mostly i just ask some questions and let them do most of the talking. 
Works wonders. 
Most of the time, they end up reliving any past football memory and usually the memory is positive so they end up thinking happily about their ""football conversation"" so they come back and talk more. 
Perfectly Lovely circle. 
Except for the unfortunate set of events that make me a very shy recluse. >Ronaldo. 

>Brazil. 

Are people really confused about that in your office OP? Honestly dude stfu. If someone is enjoying something, let them. Don't rain on their parade. Be happy that the sports getting more viewership (which means more exposure for players, more money in the competition for the players and organisers etc).

It doesn't matter if you're a master tactician in Football or if you're a newb, Football, like every sport, is for everyone. If you're a true fan of football you would know that, and you would be happy that more people are watching it.
 Fuck all of them! Uruguay masterrace I get this a lot. I don‚Äôt care at all about league football, even though it is probably the highest quality of the game. I never felt any affiliation for any club, and even though I find die hard fans of foreign clubs in india quite amusing, that‚Äôs their choice.

On the other hand, I absolutely love the World Cup. There is more than money at stake and it is truly a world event. You also get to sample different styles of football on a single stage. I get told off by the Manchester United fans that I am supposedly a seasonal lover of football, and I shouldn‚Äôt have opinions. It‚Äôs totally being snobbish. Not everyone has the time or inclination to watch league matches through the year. This is the case with every sport everywhere on the face of Earth. 


You think people who love Formula 1 can explain the physics behind DRS? You think people who watch cricket can bowl reverse swing? You think all people who enjoy watching Saina Nehwal know what a forecourt is? 


People can casually enjoy things without being experts of it. 



r/gatekeeping  Lmao same during El clasicos  Whenever I meet such people I just ask them technical questions like  
1. when does the referee give direct/indirect freekick  
2. does offside rule apply on throw in/goal kick  
3. can a goal/own goal be scored from goal kick

This simply shuts them up. To be honest we do need such people to make the game more popular. Heh so true and annoying.

"Daily sports period must, says CBSE",330,8eg6k3,http://www.thehindu.com/education/schools/daily-sports-period-must-says-cbse/article23638683.ece?utm_campaign=socialflow,69,,LondonCapital," Hopefully these periods won't be annexed by the more ""important"" subjects like science and math. I remember most of my sports periods used to be stolen by these teachers between 9th to 12th grade because if we don't prepare for board exams we'll be failures in life. Bc mazaa aa jata mere time mein. Three lousy games period per week isn't enough to play football.  

Let us say there is 1 football, 1 basket ball and 1 volley ball and 1 cricket ground available in a school.

Maximum number of children that can play = 22+10+12+22 = 66 i.e. 1 section of a class.

Maximum 8 sports period = 8*66 = 528.

I doubt any school has only 528 students.

So we have this guideline 

>  but will be free to perform any physical activity 

And so we basically have extra lunch period. In 11th, 12th, my school gave us a games period everyday, from 3-3.30. And our PT teachers would allow us to extend it till 4.30. The best decision taken by the school ever, imo

The juniors were so lousy they'd prefer to sit in their classrooms and jerk off Ok.. But before that playground should be mandatory for all schools.. Some schools don't even have a playground and without a playground what do you do in the sports period ? Play snakes and ladders ? Saar, yeh sports kya hota hai ??
People need to realise that 9-5 job with shit boss and no love for your work is waaaaaay better than actually following your passion Tbh, I was a failure in sports in school. Every 'sporting event' we had, I came last. While my friends were supportive, every 'sports' period where we were asked to do something bought me great anxiety and dread. The Sports teachers gave me single digit marks and fucked up my internals.

Behenhchod kuch bhi nahi hota tha theek se, Football khelta tha, defending me hagta tha. Goalkeeping karu tab bhi goal nahi ada sakta tha. Cricket me duck pe out or can't defend a boundary. Volleyball me service net ke upar se gaya toh bahot badi baat hoti thi. Mc running events me bhi last.

It's not like I'm obese or horribly out of shape; I have an average build, and was even among the taller ones in my peers. I simply suck at every sport. Had this been implemented when I was in school, I would have been pretty stressed. bc harr roz anxiety aur embarrassment.

I'm not against this either, it was good to get out of the class and hang out. Sometimes we used to play an uneducated form of rugby which basically involved tackling people randomly. i'm just giving my perspective. I hated even the one period of PE per week we had. This would have been the stuff of my nightmares.  Good for eyes, good for physical and mental health. But many schools in city limits lack own playground, and share with other schools, so that can be one problem [deleted] We had just one game period per week and even then teachers would try to hijack it for shitting on us. Assholes.. In my time any period in 11th/12th was a sports period if we wanted it to be. Also known as lunch break 2 in my days. Our school had a sand instead of grass for a football field and our goal posts were actually perpendicular to each other.This was a reputed KV in a Tier-2 city. 
As soon as we started playing, all the sand was flying in the air, every other day or so the football would find itself out of the field, in someone's house.
No coach would ever teach a thing to anyone, never, despite having round 3-4 PT/sports teachers.Forget about teaching anything related to PT, fitness, nutrition etc.
 
In the middle of the field there used to be people playing cricket, volleyball and badminton all at one place, this was one giant clusterfuck.
Not only this, they used to make 2-3 classes play on the same field (50avgX3)simultaneously, so basically people running here and there like madmen fights happening every other minute, others were busy trying to flirt with girls who never ever participated in sports.

The real kicker is that our school actually had a standard sized outdoor basketball court, not one, but 'two' badminton courts, a room with two standard table tennis courts and all the sport equipment in the world which was kept new and shiny until the day the school inspectors would arrive, when magically the equipment was put into use and hid immediately as the inspection ended.These guys used to take away anyone cricket bat and put it into the sports room.

Later, we also had a Gymnasium, which again I never saw anyone visit.
They only rare times they would let anyone use the facilities was when they knew the inter-school competitions were coming up and only those students would be allowed to use them who already used to take private sports coaching outside of school,  wtf? man. I still remember me and my buddies who were bored with shitty lecturers trying to participate in TT and being told to fuck-off, one of my buddies was actually good at it, but never got a chance. ""Daily sport period"" was just a myth for us... we had only 1 sport period in a week...and in most of the case it was either abandoned by rain or by other subject teachers... Tfw sports teacher would pussy out to some arrogant academic teacher who would eat up the only happy thing about schools. Luckily I used to spend 2 hours almost everyday for sports practice :D
An hour every morning for athletics (i was allowed to skip those boring assemblies) and an hour before leaving for football/basketball practice. Bhosdike hafte me ek ""sports"" perid lagate hain fir olympic ke time be hai\-tauba machate hain ki medal kyu nahi aa rahe. Us ek ghante me koi dusra master kabza jama leta hai aur 90&#37; se zyada time to  kabhi koi sports ka saman nhi mila hoga jaha tak mujhe yad hai. This happened to me in KV around 15 years ago....don't know about today's conditions in KV! How is sports period in schools nowadays anyway. Back in my day, it was 20 minutes of marching for some reason, then the PE instructor would toss some worn out ball at us and go sit in the bleacher under the shade for the rest of the period while we did whatever.  yes, until some math teacher wants you to cover her syllabus plan P.S. Schools without adequate sports facilities can send their students to the nearest shakha.   Bc even in the picture you can see the posture is completely wrong. Can lead to hamstring pain and lower back issues 


Making something compulsory is fine and dandy at least  make sure you have teachers that are educated and actually give a shit.  Meh. These rules won't even be followed. Remember how CBSE said coaching institutes can't run integrated school programs with CBSE schools? Nothing happened. FIITJEE still has their 2 year Pinnacle program going strong. Most city schools in Chennai don't even have playgrounds. We used to play in the government ground in the adjoining street.  Why only sport? Why not esport too? What to do?Science and math teachers will got an extra period to take special classes.",Sports,2018-04-24 08:01:48
Why did Mahatma Gandhi only drink Goat milk?,2,9l0v10,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9l0v10/why_did_mahatma_gandhi_only_drink_goat_milk/,31,Any particular reason or just preference?,sidass," Because he was GOAT (Greatest of all time, a term used by sports fans)  Gandhi considered cow as holy and believed that using cows for beef and milk production is disrespectful to the holy cow.. Hence he drank only goat milk, since he did not consider goats as holy.. Because he LIKED goat milk. Google said: [https://scroll.in/article/838057/why-the-story-of-gandhis-nervous-breakdown-in-1918-and-goat-milk-is-relevant-for-todays-india](https://scroll.in/article/838057/why-the-story-of-gandhis-nervous-breakdown-in-1918-and-goat-milk-is-relevant-for-todays-india) It's an aphrodisiac. His cousins brought him the milk and the rest is history.. Somewhat off topic. He used to eat goat meat as a kid for some months when coaxed by his brother's friend as Gandhi thought that vegetarian Hindus were too weak to drive British away from India. Because goats exhale oxygen and cure cancer...duh! 

Oh wait.. I‚Äôd stick with Cow Milk. Goat milk is high in saturated fats while both are equivalent in Calcium. The big reason to drink Milk is for the calcium, which vegetables can‚Äôt provide nearly enough of. 

You only need 1 cup/katori of Raita and 1 cup/katori of Cow‚Äôs Milk to meet your daily calcium needs. ",Sports,2018-10-03 20:50:47

But i love IKEA RemindMe! 4 years ""Has IKEA launched stores in India yet?"" I want IKEA khatiyas. I want to see the pricing and compare with local furniture marts once this opens. 

Anything close to their price zone, most of the business will be in trouble. Many furniture marts are unfortunately over priced.  If this is going to be remotely like their other stores, expect a major upheaval in the Indian furniture retail industry. For a new home owner I expect a few lakhs in savings in indoor furnishings. All those scummy wood contractors are going to bankrupt soon. I'm curious to see how the IKEA model will (or won't) work in India. Big box retail chains tend to work best in cities where land is very cheap, and that's not the reality for major metros here. Their Hyderabad showroom is going to cost a bomb.

[NP] The Indian Sports scene has improved drastically in the last few years. What changed?,194,8b4qi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8b4qi7/np_the_indian_sports_scene_has_improved/,72,"India has been doing well in Badminton, Boxing, Hockey, Shooting, Football, Weight lifting, Table tennis, Kabaddi etc., in the last few years. People have started showing interest towards these sports never like before. 

For a country that has always been very 'cricket' centric, what has changed in these years?",whackybrain," I follow few of the sports you mentioned.

Badminton - Saina was already performing well. Kidambi, Prannoy, Sindhu, Sai were all expected to perform well. Satwik/Chirag is the only newfound guys. Basically we're seeing the results of Gopichand's efforts.

Boxing - New wave of boxers. Also from what I understand we were doing better early too, but the association problems was an issue. New association gives stability. Also foreign coaches(Santiago Nieva -men's team and Raffaele Bergamasco- was youth and junior in-charge, after Youth World Championships success, now in charge of seniors too i believe). Still on senior level, at least in men's category, we're not at world standard.

Shooting - The new generation of shooters coming in should be credited to Bindra. He really inspired the kids. Also the facility has improved. Many new academies. Shooting is where we're going to be really good. Only problem i see is other than shooters who come from army background, it's really rich people sports.

Weightlifting - Other than Saikhom Mirabai Chanu and Jeremy Lalrinnunga, none is world class. But with every tournament, lifters are only improving, not going backwards. I believe the national coach Vijay Sharma is pretty good.

Table tennis - Massimo Costantini(national) is doing really good. And most junior players are inspired from Sharath Kamal Achanta. But none of our tt players are world class. The juniors Archana Kamath and Manav Takkar is doing good in junior circuit, but still wont defeat top 5 of Chinese/Japanese players. 

TLDR; Foreign coaches, funds. Efforts from star players who's inspiring new generation. And fantastic work done by OGQ,Gosports and obviously Indian army(weightlifting, boxing etc). And there is a long way to go. Commercial houses sponsoring these events. Privatization of leagues like ISL, Kabaddi, PBL (Premier Badminton League), Super Boxing League has resulted in athletes getting a lot of exposure to foreign coaches, learning new techniques and keeping themselves supremely fit.

Also, a little credit to the government who has actively supported these ventures.

Moreover, a lot of athletes are getting corporate and commercial sponsorships, enabling them to compete in almost all the tournaments around the world, thereby giving them precious practice against the best. Around **150 athletes** preparing for Tokyo Olympics, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games, **were provided Rs.50,000 monthly stipend from September 2017**.

Its not a only thing, but surely would had helped those atheletes who don't have stable income source and also concentrate on their diets and training.

Link - https://www.news18.com/news/sports/top-athletes-to-get-monthly-stipend-of-rs-50000-1519295.html Some great media stories about Saina Nehwal/PV Sindhu, Vijender Singh, Abhinav Bindra, ISL, Pro Kabaddi League and some other factors are responsible. Don't base this on the CWG. It hardly has strong competition in weight lifting, wresting, shooting etc. In Asian games and the Olympics, we still come short. Most of these still do not have that much widespread popularity. As for football/soccer, it has already been more popular than cricket in West Bengal/Assam for a long time. No sport is at the same level as cricket because none of them give the same level of fame or money. As far as football is concerned, it will take a long time before we are at par with European/Latin American teams. Off topic but 4-5 people from my school featured in the Khelo India competition and got the whole school interested in other sports like Basketball and Squash rather than the standard Cricket and Football. Some of the reasons listed here are spot on. Another reason is that there is often a psychological barrier that people face, and once one person breaks through, everybody realizes that they too can do it.


For example, the four minute mile was considered the limit for a very long time. Then one athlete broke through that, and soon enough many followed.


Indian children after seeing that other India s they look up to are performing well, now believe that they can do it as well. You can read the book called the talent code by Daniel coyle who goes into detail about this.


It also explains why we're so damn good at cricket. Progress has always been there but inconsistent that's why we saw the dip in Rio 2016.  
  
You have to understand, CG, Asian Games, World Championships and Olympics are events where athletes get primed to perform at their peak.  There's still a significant difference in the quality of playing field in CG and Asian Games. However, it's the progress in between these events that shows you the true improvement of players (qualification, personal bests, participation in 'A' category of events etc).  
  
**Table Tennis:** Traditionally not a force to be reckoned with. Kamal is definitely an inspiration and has been carrying the Indian team for a long time. However, Manika Batra's win over the World No 4 is probably a career defining for her as well as Indian TT. UTT league also led our players to rubbing shoulders with their  international counterparts leading to a general improvement in their games.  
Most of them play in the European club circuit for further training and enhancing their game.  
  
**Badminton:** Structured programme. Sponsors. Vimal Kumar. Gopichand - Left the game at an early age after winning the All England Championships due to frequent injuries and lack of infrastructure. Setup his own academy.  
With India becoming one of the newest powerhouses of badminton, there's increased media attention as well. Also, PBL helps. 
 
  
**Shooting:** India was always a powerhouse though doesn't have the Olympic medals to show for it. Heena Sidhu, Jeetu Rai, Gagan Narang are World champions and always contenders for these clashes. However, the new youngsters cropping up is a delight to watch. This could be due to our improved showing in Olympics, role models (Bindra, Kumar etc), infrastructure improvement and OCQ among others. Still an elite sport though.  
Bindra might be pulling off something like Gopichand in shooting a la, his own academy.
 
  
**Weightlifting:** Were pretty strong, if not medal winning, mid-2000s and before. Administration and doping issues. The Indian Weightlifting Federation has had frequent and regular skirmishes with the International WF wrt to doping etc including blanket bans. Seems like we have a clean contingent after a fairly long time.  
Realistically, Chanu was a huge medal hopeful in Rio 2016. Missed all her attempts. 
  
**Athletics and swimming** seem to have a lot more to catch up due to various factors: infrastructure, administration, physiological, financial and others.  
Although, individually PT Usha and a host of other coaches are really upping the notch. 
 There's also the javelin prodigy Neeraj Chopra to look forward to. 
  
**Kabaddi:** I believe, purely due to the pro Kabaddi league, not sure we follow the national team's performances as closely as we watch PKL. India, as it is, are the champions in all the three World Cups played.  
  
**Football:** Not that it wasn't already popular, ISL just woke up the dormant football fans having to just follow PL, La Liga etc  to getting good quality home grown football. Have been making significant strides under Constantine.  
  
**Hockey:** Doing pretty well since the last 5 years or so, except that we still lack the big game mentality and falter on the world stage. Still a hugely competitive team with quality players. Have come a long way since we failed to qualify for Beijing 08.  
  
Overall, still a huge way to go. Lots of administration problems today as well.  
The media's barometer of success (read fickle) cannot and shouldn't reflect the true state of Indian sports, however insignificantly negative or positive it might actually be.  Strategically, this was bound to happen. 

India is a huge market, really huge. And, the people are entertainment-starved. Out of the billion plus population (excluding infants, adolescents and very old persons) , even if a hundredth part are interested in a sport , that is 10 million people for you, larger than many nations.

Now, you just marry the two. Infow of money in the meanwhile also props up the quality of sports. To sum up, as income levels in India keep growing, you will see more sports getting developed and organized like kabaddi, badminton in recent years. Sports ministry headed by a sportsperson?  I dont think you were following our performance in last Asian Games & Olympics. Believe i or not, but we have actually regressed from the height of 2012 London Olympics. return on investment takes time to fruition...and there is a lot of corporate money being invested in athletes and sports infrastructure thru which we'll reap even better results in the near and coming future.. The main thing is money, plain and simple. Once IPL proved to be a huge commercial success, a lot of other leagues sprouted up. And when different sports are actually being promoted people tend to get interested in them We've always done well in CWG - because there's simply not much competition. Wait until the Olympics and we get owned by every tiny ass European country.  Our tally actually went down during the last Olympics. Ache Din Khelo India program by Modiji.. Only thing that changed. Credit where it is due. /s Besides the other things mentioned, one lesser change I think deserves mention is the sports we focus on. Earlier too, India excelled in non-cricket sports like Hockey. The trouble is that only means one medal. Alternately, with weightlifting, wrestling, boxing and shooting, there are dozens of medals on offer. So Indians shifting focus to these games has meant they are winning many more medals. 

We can win a lot more if we focus on athletics and swimming.  Paisa Historically speaking as a country starts doing economically well it reflects in their sports performance (see China's ascent and Russia's descent in recent history). Probably because people are not existing hand to mouth anymore and have time and resources to spend on sports. just remember that the CWG is a very localized competition - and even on that scale the numbers are not really impressive. 

 Nutrition mostly imo  Once someone breaks a barrier , more people starts following you. That's what happened. India won a world cup in cricket and that's when people started following cricket so much. And probably cricket was the only sport until then in which we had a world cup. But since we started getting gold in other sports , people started following these sports as well. I remember very well when Saina Nehwal won an Olympic medal suddenly Badminton following increased. Same is happening with other sports and I couldn't be more happy. I'm a Volleyball guy and as any other sport , there are certain barriers.

Even our best clubs like BFC arent the best even in Asia. Honestly we arent athleatic enough to compete in football on global stage like the WC.  Fitness and food habits.  The reception. 
Younger generations have started liking non-cricket sports. There is a huge fan base for football, badminton, tennis etc. 
As reception has increased so the number of viewers and players and effectively sponsorship.  Let's have discussion on the same topic after Tokyo 2020. But why no love for e-sports or for that matter, airsoft ? E-sports is also slowly coming up, which is nice.  Narendra Modi. >What changed?

People started moving away from that boring, pathetic colonial sport that had built unreasonable hype to the point of indoctrination and hero worship, among the population. And are starting to learn that in fact, that lame-ass game called cricket is not the only pro-sport to exist.

Eventually, slightly better facilities were created for them, media started delegating some time to these sports from the usual hourly worship sessions for the Indian cricket team. The result was even more positive exposure to the public for these sports, and some recognition for the hard-working people who play and take part in them.

That's what happened. We are still far from ideal situation though. People started caring less about cricket",Sports,2018-04-10 11:49:33

Viswanathan Anand stuns World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen in Riyadh world rapids,792,7mk5h4,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/viswanathan-anand-stuns-world-no-1-magnus-carlsen-in-riyadh-world-rapids/articleshow/62265733.cms,111,,aham_brahmasmi," Stuns? Anand has always been an ace at rapid chess. One of the few Indian sportsmen that the Indian youths should really look up to. Real talent and simplicity. [removed] > Stuns

Vishwanath Anand is one of the best chest players ever, and Magnus Carlsen often regards him as his toughest opponent. It's awesome, but not an ""upset"" by any means Je baat! So why do we need a separate tournament for women? It just sounds counterproductive. 

Might be a stupid question. Good lad! Stuns is actually a good word here, seeing how Magnus Carlsen has destroyed Anand in the last two world championships they played in.

Carlsen is probably one of the most gifted chess players of all time. Also, it does not help Kasparov coaches him or that Anand was already past his peak when Carlsen entered the scene.

It's so uplifting to see Anand defeat Carlsen again. Even though if they played another world championship, Carlsen will stomp through all matches with ease.

As much as a genius Anand is, Carlsen is a cold hearted monster. While Anand did win with black, Carlson made a blunder with 33. Nc5. So yeah, I'd hardly call it stunning. Here's the winning video: https://youtu.be/HryrgWoRelU He was called 'lightning kid' for a reason While this is good news for Anand, take a look at his previous game in the same tournament (against Peter Leko). It's fantastic. Reminds you of some of Anand's ""immortals"".

Even during that weird break , those guys in extra innings said bowlers did a good job but we have to commend the way they batted.

Bowlers are the one who makes this sport interesting but unfortunately, they never get any credits for their contribution. Batriarchy It's called the TOI-let paper for a reason.

OTOH. The bowlers did a fantastic job. Match would have been more interesting with AB and Faf, though. Show Kohli and sell more papers;

And even among these bowlers who were supposedly good, had a history of being unpredictable . Our bowlers can barely throw bouncers on a pitch on days when others were doing good. We never had good pacers like Wasim, McGrath, or Vaas who single handedly changed the course of game on several occasions. 

Adding to that, cricket is more of a batsmen's game. My opinion is completely drawn from Indian audience, who like batting more than anything else. Remember your days when you played cricket and you would feel disappointed when you don't get to bat ?

 True cricket lovers appreciate good bowlers as well as batsmen. I was once a cricket fanatic. However, I lost my interest completely after the prominence of T20. I hated it when they made it too easy for the batsmen. Once it was too hard to score a century, but nowadays anyone can score a double hundred quiet easily.

**Not fair to others, says Rahul Dravid as he questions his Rs 50 lakh reward** 

 ______ 
The Indian Under-19 team has won its fourth World Cup and its 2018 run made it
the most successful U-19 team in the world. Team Coach Rahul Dravid couldn‚Äôt
be happier, but he has a question for the BCCI: Why the disparity in cash
prizes between him, his support staff and the winning squad?

The BCCI has announced awards of Rs 50 lakh for Dravid, Rs 20 lakh each for
the support staff and Rs 30 lakh for the players.

It is learnt that Dravid was unhappy that he was to receive prize money far
greater than the rest of his coaching staff. Sources said the head coach has
expressed his reservations and has requested that all support staff members be
rewarded evenly. It is learnt that Dravid has underscored the importance of no
discrimination against the other members of the coaching staff.

Sources also said that Dravid has mentioned that the entire support staff had
worked as a team, and had played an equal and united part in ensuring success
at the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand.

In a press release announced by BCCI‚Äôs Supreme Court-appointed Committee of
Administrators on February 3, the Board had allotted Rs 50 lakh to Dravid,
while declaring that the rest of the support staff ‚Äì Bowling coach Paras
Mhambrey, Fielding coach Abhay Sharma, Physiotherapist Yogesh Parmar, Trainer
Anand Date, Masseur Mangesh Gaikwad and Video analyst Devraj Raut ‚Äì would each
receive Rs 20 lakh. The playing team members were also to be rewarded Rs 30
lakh each.

Addressing a press conference on returning from New Zealand, after the win on
Saturday, Dravid had said he credited the success of the team to the entire
support staff which had worked hard behind the scenes. He had gently pointed
out the disparity.

After the world title triumph at New Zealand on Saturday, Dravid had
acknowledged the role of support staff. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit embarrassing at times
because I tend to get a lot of attention and focus, but it is really about the
support staff and the quality of people that we‚Äôve had. I don‚Äôt want to
mention names but everyone in the support staff has put in a great effort. We
do the best for the kids.‚Äù

Dravid was at the centre of a conflict of interest situation at the start of
his stint as in 2017, and had subsequently chosen national duty over an IPL
coaching contract. He receives Rs 4 crore annually for a 3-year-contract with
the Indian junior and A teams.

The remaining support staff too works on contracted BCCI payrolls. Dravid
though, has insisted that everyone had an equal part to play in the victorious
fortnight and months of preparations prior to that.

Early 1980s to mid 1990s? If every decent place is so expensive, how can monthly expenses be low? A regular place with fast casual vibes will cost rs 700-1000 for a good dinner per head.  Fucking Millennials!

# Haryana government asks athletes to hand 33% of their income to state

## In what comes as a shocker, the Haryana government has ordered athletes to
donate one-third of their income earned from professional sports or commercial
endorsements to the Haryana State Sports Council.

Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. (Source: PTI)

In what comes as a shocker, the Haryana government has ordered athletes to
donate one-third of their income earned from professional sports or commercial
endorsements to the Haryana State Sports Council. In a government notification
dated April 30, 2018, the government has asked sportspersons to deposit 33% of
their income to the Council which it says will be used for development of
sports in the state.

‚ÄúOne-third of the income earned by sports-persons from professional sports or
commercial endorsements will be deposited with the Haryana State Sports
Council, amount to be used for development of sports in the state,‚Äù a
notification issued by the government reads.

The notification added that in case the sportsperson is treated on duty with
prior approval of the competent authority while taking part in professional
sports or commercial endorsements, the full income earned by the sportsperson
on this account will be deposited with Haryana State Sports Council.

Reacting to this development, Olympic medalist and wrestler Sushil Kumar said
that the government needs to re-think about the policy. Sushil said that he
has never heard of an order like this from any part of the world.

Another leading athlete from the state, Geeta Phogat said that it would have
been understandable if the new rule had applied to cricketers since they earn
a lot from the sport. ‚ÄúIt is understandable if this new rule is applied to
cricketers, since they earn a lot from the sport as well as through
endorsements. However, from athletes from sports such as wrestling, kabaddi
and boxing etc., this is extremely disappointing. 33% is a huge amount and in
such a case, what will remain with the athlete?‚Äù she told Times Now.

The Haryana government had landed in controversy after 22 athletes from the
state won medals at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in April 2018 but the
function to felicitate them was cancelled as the players threatened a walkout
over the government‚Äôs proposal to take a cut of their prize money.

I think this is a plan by the sports administrators to loot the sports persons income for their benefit since right now all prize money goes to the sports person. Imagine the suffering of these administrator when they see these sportsmen make so much money, if any, while they have earn neither respect nor fame.

"Experts on Indian football, when do you think will we see India in a football world cup?",29,8rh8io,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8rh8io/experts_on_indian_football_when_do_you_think_will/,25,"From 2026, there will be 48 teams in the world cup rather than 32. There will be 8 Asian teams instead of 4 in the competition. India has already qualified for the AFC Asia Cup 2019 (which have 16 Asian teams) as they did in 2011. 

How much longer will it require till we get to the top 8? Also, after the rise of European football fandom and ISL, are more and more Indian youngsters playing football and getting better coaching opportunities? 

If yes, when do we see these youngsters storm the national team and make us a major force, at least, in Asia?

If no, are we at least on the path to improvement in our quality / level of football?",Monsultant," Few years back I was very pessismistic. But the rise of Iceland has given me hope that may be we can target the World Cups in 2030s. I don't think it's definitively impossible. A truly professional AIFF is key, has to be supported well financially by government & sponsors initially, it will pay ten times over if we succeed, and fans.  India may not play in 2026 world cup. Period.

Top 8, 10+ years easy. 

Path to improve: focus on physical aspects in growing children.

We still don't have any focus on sports.

Football is very physical game. A typical player may run 6-7 kms in one match alone. Can our youngsters do this?

Training: new clubs are emerging and everything is on track. It's way too early to gauge the quality of players being minted.

Infrastructure: less we speak about it better.

Our players are long way away from glory at international stage.

Audience is thankfully aware of international football scene, but does this audience itself play this game ?

Things will drastically change when this audience will understand this game like we do cricket. This audience when starts playing football will be early marker for our glory at international scene.

Till then, keep supporting our bhutiya's. The Saudi team that got steamrolled 5-0 by Russia's 'weakest ever team' will beat India 9/10 times. That is the distance between us and the WC.

I see at least 20 years between us having reasonable chance of qualifying. I guess if you start feeding Indian toddlers lots of protein from today, then maybe by the 2034 world cup. We're just not physically compatible with very physical sports  FIFA is expanding number of teams in football so that India and China can make it .They want our markets to fill their pockets as well.

There is an expectation 2030 World Cup will have 63 teams .That would be realistic target for us. As of now, I do not see India qualifying for the world cup even if there 48 teams. There is still lot of change to be made at the ground level even though it has improved a lot in the last decade. I have seen and played with people who have are currently playing in ISL and even in the national team. The amount of money a footballer earns how has definitely increased and the opportunities have also increased for young upcoming football players. If I compare with the kind of opportunities we used to get as a young footballer say 7-8 years back with today then that has changed significantly now. Just because football is becoming popular doesnt relate to performance .  All those teams that have won the cup have strong footballing culture , from local to national .  Germany for example has 165k football coaches .  Like cricket in india , if  football develops then maybe in 20-30 years . in an alternate universe, indian team has won the trophy and celebrations are on right now. ;) When India hosts the world cup. Never. And i am not completely sure its because the people or the govt doesnt give a fuck about football.

**Tripura Will Develop 56 Inch Chest If Its Youth Take Fitness Challenge: Biplab Deb** 

 ______ 
Biplab Deb said he requested sports ministry to provide funds to develop
Tripura's sports infrastructure

**Agartala: **

Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb on Saturday said that if Tripura's youth take
up the fitness challenge campaign by the union sports minister, they would
become healthy and the health of the state would improve too. ""All the youths
should stay fit. If all youths do push-ups, they will become healthy and
Tripura will become healthy too ... Automatically, Tripura will develop
56-inch chest and follow the direction of '

_Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas_

' for development,"" Mr Deb said, apparently alluding to Prime Minister
Narendra Modi.

PM Modi had reportedly claimed that he had a 56-inch chest during his campaign
before the 2014 general election to lash out at the incompetence of his
opponents.

Mr Deb said he himself had accepted Union Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh
Rathore's fitness challenge and tweeted that he does 20 push-ups.

""I could do 20 more. Youths will feel good and fresh if they give 20, 30, 40
push-ups every morning,"" he said.

Mr Deb said he has requested the union sports minister to provide more funds
to develop sports infrastructure in Tripura.

Mr Rathore, he said, agreed to develop a sports complex and sought 17 acres
which would include all necessary facilities for sports.

""Development doesn't mean only industries. It also means developing sports.
One has to be an all-rounder (to perform well),"" the chief minister said at a
programme where ace gymnast Dipa Karmakar, tennis star Somdev Dev Varman,
national women's football team goalkeeper Laxmita Reang and Dronacharya
awardee and gymnast Bisweswar Nandi were felicitated.

Mr Deb said his government would work to further develop sports infrastructure
in Tripura and called for Khelo Tripura, Sustho Thako Tripura (Play Tripura,
Stay Healthy Tripura).

__ Comments

He said sports stars should be involved in annual sports events of schools and
other programmes to encourage promising talents across the state.

Sports and Youth Affairs minister Manoj Kanti Deb said stress would be laid on
Kabaddi, Judo, basketball, and football and other sports and expressed hopes
of holding the National Games in the state in the future.

Title calls Us to stop celebrating. Just wow Ah, it's the lazy ""omg why can't we also get medals/tourneys"" article that you can reliably expect every Olympics/Football World Cup/Asian games. The author offers no analysis of why we can't win medals, no explanation of what we need to do to become better, not even the bare minimum effort to reach out to someone in the sports ministry for a fucking comment. They've contented themselves with ""what's the plan? I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't one"".

We've been reading this article for the last 20 years, and we'll read it for the next 20 too.

So let me take a stab at it. **Why can't we win medals?**

The short answer is that we actually have excellent sportsment in India but they're not playing sports. Some made a conscious choice of choosing more stable forms of employment like being an engineer/doctor/CA. Sadly, others probably never even got a chance to play the sport in which they were destined for greatness. Our best archer probably never held a bow in their life, the finest swimmer might not live within 100km of a decent pool and the greatest skier ever might never have seen snow fall.

Its worth looking at what we do in cricket. Almost every kid picks up a bat and ball at some point and gives it a good go. The decent ones get an opportunity at quality coaching, even by former national players. But most importantly, you don't need to be Virat Kohli to have a decent life. You can have a decent, middle class life as a cricketer playing in the Ranji trophy and IPL, so kids get to pour their time into cricket rather than college prep. The lesson here is that the key metric is not what the top sportspeople (Dhoni, Kohli) earn, but what the median sportsperson (Rayudu, Badrinath) earns.

For a sport like football, we can do more than the government can. If we want to be good at football in 20 years, we need to start filling every stadium for every match between any team at any level. Those bums on seats means ticket revenue, that fan interest translates to sponsorship money, all of which translates to salaries that make a viable career path. Once we achieve that, we will see more kids prefer football to being an engineer. Then we have a shot at the 2046 World Cup.

For niche sports like archery, swimming, skating, cycling etc, it's more difficult. The government needs to spend money on building archery ranges and swimming pools and skiing rinks and velodromes and more. We need to spend money on scouting, we need to spend money on scholarships, we need to spend money on equipment, and coaching. Sports success costs money. Where will all this money come from? We don't have it, sadly. I know it hurts to hear, but we won't have this kind of money for a long time. 

One day India will be rich. One day 10% of people will wear Nikes and Adidas, instead of 0.01% as it is now. That 1000x increase will translate to sponsorship money for every sportsperson, even the small time ones in niche sports. Nike will be falling over themselves to make custom footwear for Swapna Barman, begging her for an endorsement.

Until then we have to content ourselves with 11 gold, 20 silver, 23 bronze medals, and somehow bear these shitty low effort articles bemoaning our lack of success. Kuch bhi. We seem to be making progress and it's disingenuous to compare ourselves with China. Ah the classic ""Sharmaji ke bette ko dekho!"" Oh we can celebrate how despite zero govt help these poor underpaid athletes are getting medals on their own accord.  [Spitting in the face of these self made heroes, stay classy, Author](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-45352716) I would ask the author of this article what is her contribution to sports and games.

evening try to cover corbyn's cove beach.  Havelock island, Jollybouy beach, Ross Island (i hand-fed a deer there for the first time ever) and Radhanagar beach were fun. Don't miss the light and sound show of cellularjail and water sports on Port Blair (check for the info on landing itself and plan accordingly) 
Go snorkelling. The corals and fishes are beautiful. 

And find lesser known beaches which are beautiful by talking to the locals, you'd get beautiful blue water with no people. Had to trek for an hour to reach one but its worth it. 

I went before the tsunami so there might be better tourist things like cruises or sea view restaurants etc If possible, stay overnight in Havelock. It's a beautiful place. You'll see it when you get there. You'll regret visiting that place in a haste.  Don't miss out on Havelock island sunset. Also the ship ride till there is amazing .
Limestone caves are also a must. Ill be going on the first day to Havelock.
Can somebody please tell me how to book a ferry? Ross Island is gorgeous and has old British era church  ruins along with peahen and deers running around everywhere freely. It's one of my favorites.


And there's a place called Ross and Smith island. It's a spot where the two islands join horizontally and divide the ocean into two. It's amazing. You should look up its pictures OP. Surreal standing at the center of it. But it's a remote place and boats are allowed to go only till 4pm so do it only  if you get enough time to return by then.

TBH most of these games are expensive to get into considering the gear, the equipment, coaching cost, etc. India hasn't had much of a sporting tradition besides kabaddi, cricket and wrestling. The average Joe/Jane in India doesn't have any spare money lying around to get into other expensive sports.

To add to it, very few of them are actually unique. Most of them follow same recipe.

Recipe 1: There is a hero, he has a heroine for whom he goes to heights to patao. There is a villain who is a corrupt politician or a gangster. Hero keeps spoiling his corrupt activities while being a common man. They fight. Fin.

Recipe 2: Same as above, except heroine is daughter of the villain.

To add to it, they play hindi movies on HD channel while SD channels have all dubbed movies. Is it some way to get people to subscribe to HD channel to get money??

P.S.: I don't dislike these movies, its just that too many of them just saturates viewing experience. Then I use TMKOC as rehabilitation from this saturation.",HueLueDue," And the worst part is instead of dubbing Hit movies they choose utter flop movies  to dub in Hindi  Those movies rights are very cheap because they were already flop 

Also I like the titles like ‚Äú badla the revenge‚Äù  Same reason that a lot of tamil and telugu channels air serials dubbed from hindi. Recycling.  Same thing happens here with Hindi serials. 'Balika Vadhu' and other such shows have been dubbed in Telugu and have grown extremely popular in recent times. Apart from the fact that a lot of people like them, which is shocking to me, am Tamil and I seriously hate all the garbage that comes out in the Industry down here, many of those get remade in Bollywood with retards like Salman Khan and become super duper hits there. Like WTF! TV channels understand that these movies get remade and so show dubbed versions of those that don't. Its not that these dubbed ones are shittier than the remade ones, they are all equally stupid.

Very few, like very very few movies that come out down here are fantastic! Great script, great direction, great story; that doesn't revolve around love/lust for the opposite sex. Well not all channels could afford for purchase rights for popular movies so they go for these instead . 

This would obviously fill some content and since it is inexpensive it will also be profitable.  In search of next Suryavansham.  Telugu not Telegu.

They do it because people liking watching them. Why do they have so many shitty soaps on Indian Tv? From what I know, many Telugu sell their dubbing rights in Hindi for huge amounts. Dubbed Telugu movies are famous on YouTube too, popular ones are garnering around 10 Million views.

So in short, Tv channels are showing just what people want to see. Do Hindi movies have different recipe?  [deleted] Am I the only one whose childhood is linked with those South Indian movies.When people talk about cult films,the Indian ones that comes to mind are those like Aparachit,Mass,Awarapan.Those movies who gained an audience just by being on Set Max.

One of my best college memories is coming home from a party in a car with guys and girls singing Sawwan me lag gayi aag,while high. I feel SD channels were fine when there was no HD. I remember watching good resolution programs on discovery channel. The clarity was really good. Does anyone here feel that they reduced the resolution of current SD channels to make them look ugly so that customers are for forced to subscribe to HD version?

For example check out  channels like Deutsche Welle or TV5 Mondo. These are European SD channels that still have better resolution than Indian SD channels.  Because  there is an audience  for it  

If you don't like  don't watch  , there is no way ranting about it on r/india is going to change  a thing  about it  I watch these movies because they are unintentionally funny. The over the top acting and action scenes are hilarious. 
The names are quite funny too. Some of the popular ones that get shown so often are:

* Don No 1 - There's a scene where the hero doesn't have a chair while meeting the villain. So he snaps his fingers and his men form a chair.

* King No 1, Gambler No 1

* Lucky the racer

* Bhavani the tiger - this is the most **epic** south Indian flick of all time. There's a scene where the villain had to fight a chicken and the chicken wins. 
Then the cops come to arrest the chicken for murder. 

* Mumbai ki kiran bedi

* Chennai vs China

As long as you watch these ironically it's a great way to pass time. 
Also please recommend some more similar movies.

EDIT: For anyone interested in the chicken [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMRY--kZjRI&t=2m10s)

BONUS: Here's a dude singing about [chai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3IBnhnTmGk) take a deep breath!

its because people (i mean a significant chunk of populous) like these  simple and easily digestible time pass movies and as long as a channel can present stats  that they have enuf people subscribed to the channel, they will get adverts and get MONEY. So, why not!

its kind of a cycle yo.

peace out! Honestly most hindi speaking people love south indian movies. most of my hindi speaking friends prefer dubbed south indian movie over bollywood and I hate it when I have to watch dubbed movies with them.  Because people like it I stopped watching movies on TV because of this shit. Used to love watching movies since I couldn't find time to go to the theater.

Then they flooded almost every channel with this stuff. It is always either south Indian movies (and only the overwhelming number of cliche garbage and weird/cheap ones, never the good ones even though there are so many good movies down south), or shitty Hindi movies that have bad reviews...or (good) Hindi dubs of crappy failures of Hollywood like John Carter.

There was a time a few years when 4 out of 7 days in the week, it was either Sivaji the Boss or Suryavansham. Throw in decent films like Karan-Arjun and Kung-fu Hustle every once a week. Hindi movies are shit.

Tamil movies are epic. Navel is love , Navel is life ! watching superhero Shehenshah right now! [This explains it](https://scroll.in/magazine/838382/off-beat-what-the-popularity-of-south-india-films-in-bihar-says-about-how-the-state-is-changing) Regional movie channels are filled with dubbed films. English movie channels are filled with comic adaptations. First is cheap thrills, second is for children. They are now dictating what we watch. The great managers doing analysis with big data tools have determined that there is no place for class. Indra the tiger = TV I have another question. Why is that only Malayalam movies aren't dubbed from the south. Rest all language movies dubs are continuously playing on tv.  Coz they are dubbed -  so constitute as a perfectly watchable hindi movie. I have seen some south movies with subs and thats their real worth, either remake in Hindi or shut up. Dont show us total out of sync classic kung fu movie style dubbing",Sports,2017-11-14 14:37:59
My daughter is jealous of her classmate's academic success. How do I help her emotionally process this negative emotion ?,38,8e3hq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8e3hq4/my_daughter_is_jealous_of_her_classmates_academic/,34,,tr_th_th," Just say that marks dont really matter in the long term, what matters is if she is learning something or not. Being pissed at someone just cause they have scored more marks than you is just bad for her mental health.

Word of OP who was once like your daughter. Have her join some other non academic activities like music, dance, arts, sports etc. This should help her channel her efforts elsewhere and focus on herself. She will also get to meet other people with different/varied skill set. Hopefully she will realize that academic success isn't the ultimate success. tell her that the will to be educated is more important than will to win... She‚Äôll always be in situations in her life where she‚Äôs not the best. She might be better of others at some things but she‚Äôll be worse in some other things. She can study as hard as she wants, but she cannot and should not waste her life in trying to be better of more talented people than she is. She should ask herself what she likes and what makes her happy. Being so much dependent on the approval of teachers or adults is not ok in my eyes. I haven‚Äôt kids but I‚Äôve been trough this as a teenager and it‚Äôs not worth it. Agree with the other viewpoints here but please note, if your daughter is so tied to relative academic success it's very difficult to remove that thought from her. My father initially pushed me heavily to compete and then later realized his mistake. None of his words helped me, partly because I thought he was initially bluffing. Though my competitive tendencies have reduced (at one point I was jealous of Terence Tao's academic success. Now I'm only jealous of my classmate's academic success) it takes time. 1. Tell her she should always aim to compete against herself and not others
2. Because people are different, different people have different talents and abilities and that's ok
3. No matter what she does, there will always be some one who is better than her at the task. Try to learn from them. 
4. Help her explore other potential non-academic talents she may have (Art, graphics, sports, music, dance, speaking, writing) I would tell her the marks are results of hard work and study. 

However getting less marks is not the end of the world.  Every one has got different kinds of talents. 
 Take her to meet people who didn't scored well in school, but are doing good.

Just let her see the future.  Tell her to fight for the next war and then the next until she wins :) Tell her nothing really matters lol

On a serious note, it's not just the issue at hand but you gotta talk to her about envy as a concept. We all have it, just have to learn to overcome it by being conscious about our thoughts. It's a natural emotion and nothing wrong with feeling that way. It's a process, takes time. How old is she? Tell her the truth. Tell her 'That's its okay to feel jealous' sometimes, its good to acknowledge it and channelize that into a productive study session or a session of sport/art.

Jealousy is a good motivator and any successful person will tell you that, but.. but.. is it taking you forwards? Or backwards? Is the real question. 

Jealousy with hatred is bad ; while jealousy out of helplessness(to achieve what someone else achieved) is normal. She is doing great imo  1) Check what benefits is her classmate getting for topping. Usually its extended attention from classmates and teachers. You as a parent can show same attention for her behavior, not for studies, but for her success in other fields, sports or arts.

2) Teach her to not compare success of one person to another. Rather be successful for yourself and not to show it to the world. If your child gets 60% in exams as compared to her classmates 85%. Make her realize her 25% remaining success was in other stuff, again sports and arts.

2.1) And if still she doesn't realize it, show her how her classmate is reaping benefits of her hard work. Obviously getting higher marks means higher efforts, be it slogging or actually understanding. If you want to out-perform your classmate, put more hard work. Make her realize this.

3) Find out what she finds unfair in this whole matter. Usually children find reasons for their low performance on unfair policies against them. Eg., She got more marks because her parents give her better gifts which encourages her. Or teacher pays more attention to her.

Find out such reasons, some might be even practical. Help her resolve that. But others which seem just as an excuse, teach her to deal with it. Life is never fair. Sometimes we need to fight for it or else learn to let it go.

4) Marks don't matter. In the end, commitment, dedication and respect is all that matters. Teach her this.

5) Get her to learn new skills. Maybe one sport, one musical instrument. When she sees class toppers slogging through books and herself playing sports or playing the instrument, respect and attention she will earn will be much better.

Some life lessons I have learnt from my 27 years of experience of converting Oxygen into Carbon Dioxide. Make her understand that grades do matter in your life, but our happiness and peace of mind matters more. You can't measure success in life based on just money, fame and grades. 

Enroll her in some nice hobbies such as, dancing, singing, sports training, musical instruments training, etc. Make her gain confidence in herself and feel comfortable with learning more about what she wants and maintaining an acceptable above average grade. 

Sadly, as much as idealistic as we want to be, you cannot say in this current world that grades don't matter. However, they don't matter as much as what most schools drill into their pupils. Take her out for shopping, a nice dinner, or a movie. Reward her for trying her best when she could and use positive reinforcement to help her grow even more.",Sports,2018-04-22 22:16:53

CHANDIGARH: Manali resident

Aanchal Thakur

made history on Tuesday by winning India's first-ever international medal in
skiing. The 21-year-old clinched bronze in the coveted Alpine Ejder 3200 Cup
organised by the Federation Internationale de Ski (

FIS

) ‚Äî

skiing

's international governing body ‚Äî at the

Palandoken Ski Centre

in Erzurum in Turkey. She won the medal in the slalom race category.

""Months of training have finally borne fruit. I started well and managed to
take a good lead, which helped later in getting the third-place finish,""
Aanchal told TOI from Turkey. Her feat is special given that there is no
culture or even infrastructure for winter sports in India. Also, those
participating in winter sports in India get negligible support from the Union
sports ministry.

Roshan Thakur, father of Aanchal and the secretary general of the Winter Games
Federation of India (WGFI), was elated. ""This is a breakthrough for the sport
in India and the entire skiing fraternity is proud of her achievement,"" he
said.

**Aanchal's father rues lack of govt support**

""Aanchal called me on WhatsApp and showed me the medal. I thought it was some
kind of a souvenir given at the end of every FIS event! But she told me that
shw won a bronze,"" her father, Roshan Thakur, said .

Aanchal's journey in international skiing has either been financed by her
father or FIS that, at times, funds her trips. Her father rues the fact that
there has been no monetary support from the Centre. ""The bureaucrats in the
sports ministry do not acknowledge skiing as a sport,"" Thakur said.

A professional skier requires skis, boots and bindings, poles, helmets, suits,
goggles and gloves to compete . Just the equipment costs around Rs 5lakh to Rs
10 lakh. ""I hope Aanchal's medal helps our cause (in getting financial support
from the Centre). I want to see my daughter and son represent the country in
the 2018 Winter Olympics,"" Thakur added. ""The Centre only funds travel and
logistics from one Olympic to another. Rest of the time, you have to fend for
yourself.""

Aanchal hails from Burua, a small village in Manali. She learnt the ropes from
her father. Later, Heera Lal, a former Olympian, honed her skills.

"Shiva Keshavan, India's lone warrior and the Winter Olympian this country does not deserve",161,7xipm2,http://www.firstpost.com/sports/shiva-keshavan-indias-lone-warrior-and-the-winter-olympian-this-country-does-not-deserve-4347637.html,39,,s0nicDwerp," Should have represented Italy.. So I was looking at the medal tally of the Winter Olympics out of curiosity hoping to see at least one medal with the Indian flag somewhere on the list. I couldn't find any. So I googled for the list of Indians participating in it and what fields and this is what I found. This is heart breaking. It's a 2 days old news now, I know but I had to share it. Winter Olympics is like the Hockey sports here in the country, except it seems to be in a far worse condition and no one gives a shit.

However I should end this on a positive note, **Thank you Shiva Keshavan** for representing the country. Hopefully the situation will improve in the coming years. You are a legend.

PS: Don't ask for TLDR. There isn't any. Read the whole damn thing. Thanks.  Only if it snowed in Haryana. Do sport companies exclusively sign cricketers? If they sponsored Olympians, won't that make them look better?  

And honestly, we should just get rid of the sports ministry and provide grants to schools, colleges, HRD, governing bodies, etc to foster sports. It's very complicated to have a central body lay down the vision of sports in a top-down approach, because you don't know what the talent pool is like. It's much easier to just sign a check and review results.  What is the point of this post? To guilt /r/india into watching Keshavan, Winter Olympics, or winter sports overall in general?

If Indians cared about winter sports beyond the Olympics (more than they do all ready), then this wouldn't be an issue. Sports is all about providing entertainment. If the sport isn't entertaining or people don't care, of course there's going to be no money in it.

Kind of like people complaining about how the US women's soccer team earns significantly less than the men's even though they've won the world cup multiple times. How many more people watch 1 match of the US men's team compared to the entirety of the women's run in the world cup?

Good on Keshavan for getting where he is and I'm 100% sure he got there without any outside help but trying to guilt people into caring? Lame. Its amazing what Shiva has done but saying this country does not deserve him is a bit too much.  The country doesn‚Äôt deserve ?  It doesn‚Äôt deserve a lot of people but a lone warrior who can represent a billion of us at the Olympics is truly a hero.  Arre bhai, snow toh girni chahiye! As it is, we live in a temperate country. The one state we have snow in is in complete control of terrorists.

The one skiiing event we have in a year was cancelling in Auli, because there was no snowfall.

Aur vaise bhi no one gives a shit about regular Olympics, toh Winter Olympics ke liye khaak denge.

""Hum tumhe regular facilities de rahe hain sports ke liye, ab tumhe ice bhi chahiye!"" - Sports babus. Winter Olympics is a circle jerk of rich people of rich countries imo. Every single winter Olympics sport has a huge financial barrier to participate.",Sports,2018-02-14 23:20:29

I think sports are overrated. Change my mind.,0,9iggj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9iggj2/i_think_sports_are_overrated_change_my_mind/,13,"I belong to India and I feel the pride when an indian person/team wins a medal is too much. Why should i attach my pride to how fast an Indian could run or bowl or swim. 
Further i hate when politicians shower money to a medal winner. why should a sportperson be a more respectable/honourable compared to  a peon or watchmen or it professional.  Sportperson is just doing his job, why should be there special status?",procastinatorax," I'll address a small portion of your question first. You seem to feel sportspersons winning medals should not and need not be felicitated as they're no better than a peon or it guy who's just doing their job. This line of reasoning completely ignores the  following facts:
A. Any notable success in sports requires lots of sacrifice and personal effort, at the end of which the result is still not assured since the human body is still subject to mental pressure and worries that affect physical performance.
B. Above-mentioned personal effort can't be put in while holding a regular 9-to-5 job: it requires exclusive and concerted effort over a span of months, if not years, to get to the physical condition and training level with which one can compete effectively for medals. As a result, athletes around the world rarely have enough time, resources or motivation/encouragement to give their all for such a risky effort. Felicitating them for medals is just a small way society can and should thank them for their sacrifice and unstinting effort.
C. Of course, all this presupposes that you're ok with sports. Anti-sports attitudes that glorify only activities  that require thought/thinking seem to forget that such mental prowess is a genetic trait and therefore, only recognising such traits is tantamount to making society one that is in thrall to eugenics and good genes. This is extreme, I know, but anti-sports and anti-sportspersons attitudes stem from one's own inability to compete athletically leading to such behaviour and thought. Anything that yields to happiness of a mass public is not overrated. It is having good food overrated? Is travelling overrated?  Because they achieve something special in their respective sports by becoming the best there is in that field from the whole country hence they epitomize the hardship faced by other professionals, very few can become successful world renowned athletes but a lot of people can become a peon or watchmen. They inspire people to strive for success and others can follow suit inspired by the type of person they are to do the right thing in their own fields. A country that celebrates its sports and sports personalities will have a more fit population too. Politicians shower money on them but if in a country like India where there are limited opportunities if you managed to make it and then get recognized enough to get money then there is nothing wrong in earning what you deserve for your hard work and you also then get empowered to make some change because then you have capital and attention to do something not everyone may succeed but surely you will be more visible than when you're just struggling. Its ok if you don't since you may not like sports but there is a joy that it spreads and you're better off adding more reasons to celebrate to your life rather than finding less need of it. IMHO, I wish you had posed this question a bit differently - in its details and not in its title, which is quite fine. 

Something similar to your titular question popped up in my mind recently while watching Federer -  Tennis has given birth to superstars quite regularly, say, every twenty years; every generation. At the beginning of the 2000s, Sampras was not just reigning supreme, he was the best of all times. Now it's Federer. Within another 20 years there would be another all-time great. 

It's regular like clockwork, this turnover of superstar in sports. I am sure we can say the same for other sports, too, like Cricket. All of which somehow makes it suspect, IMHO. 

Remember, sports is originally introduced to us as an athletic activity. Later, it becomes entertainment. Eventually, most of us when we talk of sports don't talk about playing it but watching it being played.  

As mass entertainment, it becomes an industry. As in any other industry then it requires capital investment, production, and sales. Once you view it this way, it will not come as surprise that there will be star sportsmen every generation - a Gavaskar, Tendulkar, Mohd. Ali, Tiger Woods, Dhoni, Kohli, Borg etc. 

These stars are not just accidents but are a requirement. The industry's lifeblood. If they are not born then they will be created. If there are no star sportsmen for a generation then that sports will certainly die as entertainment. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr when sports become entertainment it has to become overrated.  I think if you played any sport yourself when you were young, you'll really appreciate the skills and things professional sportsmen have and do. It is especially entertaining when they do it in a crucial time and that makes you want to watch more.  https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/nirmal_shekar/sport-is-more-often-about-failure/article7967625.ece/amp/

 Sports generate lot of revenue and employ lot of people. They are good for economy.

Look at big picture, TV rights, advertising, construction of stadiums, ticket sales, merchandising, employment for thousands of people. Sports is like a growth industry which can generate lot of revenue over a long period of time. Pride attached to a national identity etc for victories in sports is I believe misplaced in the sense that, countries/states can change due to politicians' decisions. You may have mergers or splits of political entities like countries(union of West and East Germany for example, or the split of the USSR or the more recent split of Sudan), then your 'pride' has no address for its erstwhile locus standi. 

Feeling happy when you win, or taking happiness from the excellence of another human or self is what I consider much more warranted. I guess more common examples of this is in tennis where many Indians root for Federer or Nadal or Djokovic for example. Sports are overrated,except the ones that are very global.

Football,Tennis , Olympics.. if the athletes of a nation excel at these ,it leads to very positive PR than can be cultivated in many diff ways. I agree. I am not that interested in sports. I just watch tennis and that's it. Also, Indians don't really care for any sport besides cricket. I almost feel they are forcing themselves to care for something they are not interested in.

Articles about Indian athletics leave me cold because they try to elicit an emotion that doesn't exist, neither within the writer nor within the reader. Here I am devastated Navi got clapped by Astralis and you think people don't feel pride when their nation claps the most hated neighbour.  Celebration of sports achievements - is always hijacked by PR hungry politicians - as it gets them free PR.

But, it also means allocation of more funds for development of sports - better equipment / better trainer etc.

So, Catch 22 situation.",Sports,2018-09-24 17:21:12

So stupid, confusing and misleading names - dhamaal mix, dhamaal kids. Not showing channel list clearly, you have to click a few times and a sad looking popup appears after few retries. 

Every month it feels like they have raised the monthly charge amount by x rupees. All of it seems like a scam to earn more from us.

Why can't they simply allow me to pick a list of channels I want to see and just pay for those? 
Imagine if someone comes up with such a DTH service, it would be awesome. I'd buy it instantly.",akahorizon," Same story is with Dishtv man,
   sab ek thali ke chatte batte hai! Ten years ago, it was much worse. English channels were spread across multiple packs, each of which had a mix of channels that defied logic. For instance, BBC Entertainment was clubbed with a religious channel, a Hindi news channel, a Tamil entertainment channel, and other unrelated rubbish. If you wanted to get all the English channels, you'd have to subscribe to at least half a dozen packs. 

Shortly after the then-CEO of Tata Sky reshuffled the packs to group them by language and content, he quit the company. Whether he was asked to leave because of that, or whether he did it as a farewell fuck-you, we'll never know. I'm relieved to find out that I'm not alone. It's a fucking nightmare. Every time I plan and recharge my annual subscription, they empty my wallet within the first 2-3 months. The web interface is definitely unpleasantly designed on purpose.  Same with Airtel. Yes, it is really confusing. Plus, they don't allow you to change package till you add ample amount in your tata sky account. So basically if you want to add a single channel, you will first have to add your monthly amount or make your account value equal to monthly value plus extra amount for new channel one wants to subscribe.

I think it is part of their business plan to extract more money. By default every customer is given ultra hd pack free for 1st month. Once started, most people tend to ignore renewal unless it is actually time. When that time comes and person sees the hard process, they might just skip it, recharge the Rs. 735 p.m. and be done with it. So where a person can save money and get pack of Rs. 450, the hard process makes person spend Rs. 735 instead.",Sports,2018-08-09 22:16:10

"What is Lacking in indian football? Ever wondered why is the Indian National Football Team not able to reach even the Group Stage of FIFA World Cups despite India making huge strides in Cricket? Somewhere, we and our Indian Football system are at fault.",3,9okcyn,http://sportsjoint.in/2017/12/21/what-is-lacking-in-indian-football/,5,,Hrishik7," It's clear that a lack of infrastructure/national interest/football culture is the problem.

That's why the population of a country has no bearing at all which is what I saw many say otherwise during the World Cup. First people should start playing in street, school etc, popularize the sport part from Goa, Assam, WB, parts of Kerala and a small indigenous population no one even watches or plays. So popularize the sport get people free access to leagues from around the world to watch, sport will pick up more ppl play more players come out and better player team. We need coach like SAF or Klopp? Just check SAF's record with ManUtd, he didn't just arrive and start winning trophies.

Updated: July 6, 2018 9:56:11 am

The report was triggered by the Supreme Court which, while considering the
Lodha Committee report on cricket, asked the Commission to examine the issue.

B R Ambedkar have been brought together, along with a host of Vedic priests
and sages, in the Law Commission‚Äôs potentially landscape-changing
recommendation to legalise betting in India.

The report, titled ‚ÄúLegal Framework: Gambling and Sports Betting including
Cricket in India‚Äù, leaves the final call to Parliament and the state
legislatures, and recommends various ways to regulate the betting market. The
commission concludes that such a move will generate immense revenue which can
be used for ‚Äúsocial welfare‚Äù, to curb underworld influence, and restrict black
money and money laundering.

The commission suggests linking Aadhaar/PAN card to betting for both operators
and participants, cash-less digital transactions to help monitor cash flow,
limitations on the amount an individual can bet, and makes a distinction
between ‚Äúproper betting‚Äù for higher stakes and ‚Äúsmall gambling‚Äù for people
with low income.

To ensure that the ‚Äúvulnerable sections are protected‚Äù, the report recommends
that minors and people below the poverty line, those who get subsidies or do
not fall within the purview of the Income Tax Act or the GST Act, should be
debarred from participating.

**ALSO READ | Make match-fixing criminal offense: Law Commission of India**

It also recommends that match-fixing and sports fraud should be made criminal
offences with severe punishments.

However, one member of the commission, S Sivakumar, has filed a separate
opinion of dissent, stating that the report isn‚Äôt comprehensive enough and
doesn‚Äôt quite address the social ills that such a legalisation can trigger.

The report was triggered by the Supreme Court which, while considering the
Lodha Committee report on cricket, asked the Commission to examine the issue.

The apex court had observed that ‚Äú‚Ä¶the recommendation made by the Committee
that betting should be legalised by law, involves the enactment of a Law which
is a matter that may be examined by the Law Commission and the Government for
such action as it may consider necessary‚Äù.

In its conclusions, the commission states that the existing policy of the
Government, the current socio-economic atmosphere in the country, and the
prevalent social and moral values don‚Äôt encourage betting and gambling.

‚ÄúAccordingly, the Commission reaches the inescapable conclusion that
legalising betting and gambling is not desirable in India in the present
scenario. Therefore, the state authorities must ensure enforcement of a
complete ban on unlawful betting and gambling,‚Äù it states.

But it immediately adds that since a total ban isn‚Äôt practical, regulation is
a good approach, provided the Parliament legalises betting. ‚ÄúThus, if
Parliament or the state legislatures wish to proceed in this direction, the
Commission feels that regulated gambling would ensure detection of fraud and
money laundering, etc,‚Äù it states.

The core of the report can be best summed up by its reference to Naradasmriti,
a treatise attributed to Narada in Indian mythology. ‚ÄúNaradasmriti describes
gambling as a lawful amusement, when carried out in public gaming houses‚Ä¶ The
Naradasmriti and Kautilya (Chanakya), all advocated that gambling should exist
under the control of the State,‚Äù the report reads.

‚ÄúUnder the control of the state‚Äù is the operative phrase that the report has
taken to heart.

A reference in the report to Katyayana Smriti, a code of conduct drafted by
Katyayana, a Sanskrit grammarian and mathematician, probably comes closest to
the report‚Äôs recommendations. ‚ÄúIf gambling cannot be stopped in the kingdom,
it shall be regulated‚Ä¶ The King should impose tax on gambling and make it a
source of income. Gambling could be carried on openly after payment of tax to
the King,‚Äù it states.

The commission also took in the suggestions they received on how legalising
betting will generate considerable revenue and employment, help develop
tourism as complementary industry and assist law-enforcement authorities.

In its conclusion, the commission summarises the benefits: ‚Äú‚Ä¶strike at the
underworld‚Äôs control over the illegal and unregulated gambling industry.
Additionally, the revenue so generated by regulating and taxing betting and
gambling, may become a good source of revenue, which in turn, could be used
for public welfare‚Ä¶ It would also enable the Government to effectively curb
the menace of black-money generation through illegal gambling.‚Äù

The recommendation to make match-fixing a criminal offence is significant as
the only reason a few Pakistani cricketers like Mohammad Asif, Salman Butt and
Mohammad Amir went to jail in UK was because betting is legal there ‚Äî and it
was deemed that they cheated punters by their act. In a country where betting
isn‚Äôt legal and fixing and fraud aren‚Äôt deemed a criminal offence, the players
could not have been punished.

Hindu epics, scriptures and treatises are liberally referenced through the
report. The Mahabharata, in particular, receives frequent mention. ‚ÄúThe
argument that had gambling been regulated in the Mahabharat period, Yudhishtir
could not have put his brothers and wife as stakes and perhaps Mahabharat
could not have been there, is full of substance,‚Äù the report states.

While making a Constitutional argument, the commission has referred to the
Constituent Assembly debates that took place on September 2, 1949, when a
motion was taken up to add betting and gambling under List II of the Seventh
Schedule.

The report notes that the move was ‚Äústrongly opposed‚Äù by Prof Shibban Lal
Saksena, Shri Lakshminarayan Sahu and Sardar Hukam Singh. Sahu, it noted,
opposed the move by ‚Äúobserving that we were guided by the lofty ideals of
Mahatma Gandhi and that the lessons learnt from the Mahabharat were not to be
forgotten‚Äù.

But the commission states that Dr Ambedkar advocated its inclusion, saying
that ‚Äúif this entry was omitted, there would be absolutely no control over
betting and gambling activities at all‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis stance provided the scope to
accommodate different notions of morality prevailing in various states,‚Äù the
report states.

Current laws don‚Äôt support betting, and the commission feels that they should
be amended accordingly. The National Sports Development Code 2011 and the
Indian Contract Law of 1882 should be modified, it says. The report concludes
by quoting former Supreme Court judge, Justice D P Madon, to state that ‚Äúas
the society changes, the law cannot remain immutable‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe law exists
to serve the needs of the society which is governed by it‚Äù.

**Kidambi Srikanth set to become World No. 1 - Times of India** 

 ______ 
HYDERABAD: Come Thursday,

Kidambi Srikanth

will become the No. 1 player in the world. The 25-year-old, who had missed a
chance to scale the peak last year because of injury, will be the new No. 1
when the

Badminton World Federation

(BWF) releases its weekly rankings.

**ALSO READ: Srikanth, Saina headline India‚Äôs first mixed team gold **   

Srikanth, who was named Times of India Sports Award (TOISA) Sportsperson of
the Year in February, is set to join the elite band two years after

Saina Nehwal

became the first Indian girl to become world No. 1. In March 2015, Saina had
scaled the summit and remains the only Indian girl to achieve this feat thus
far.

**CWG**2018:** Know your CWG athlete - Kidambi Srikanth**

Srikanth will be the first Indian man to achieve this fabulous feat in modern
ranking era. Prior to the computerised ranking system,

Prakash Padukone

was regarded as world No.1 after he won three top tournaments in 1980.

Srikanth, who played a crucial role in helping India win gold at the
Commonwealth Games on Monday, will move to the top of rankings with 76,895
points.

Reigning world No.1 and world champion Viktor Axelsen, who has 77130 points,
will lose 1660 points and slip down the ladder. The Danish shuttler will lose
points because he will be unable to defend what he had won at the Malaysian
Open last year.

The Malaysian Open was held from April 4 to 9 last year but this year, it is
scheduled for a later date. Badminton rankings are calculated for a period of
52 weeks. In this period, rankings points from the 10 best tournaments are
taken into consideration.

Md

Maqdoom Ahmed

, a badminton analyst for the Sports Authority of India (SAI) said: ""We've
been anxiously waiting for this moment. He should have become No. 1 last year
but injury prevented him from playing the year-end tournaments. Had he reached
quarterfinals in a couple of those tournaments he could have become No. 1.
Though Srikanth won't gain any points, Axelsen losing 1660 points will be good
enough for the Indian,"" Maqdoom told TOI.

Srikanth won four Super Series titles - Indonesia, Australia, Denmark, France
- in 2017 to become the fourth shuttler in the world to achieve this feat. He
had secured the No.2 ranking on November 2, 2017.

Srikanth's father KVS Krishna said that they are waiting for the big moment.
""We know he will become No.1 in a week or two. It's definitely a proud moment
for all of us,"" Krishna said.

Still can't get over how he totally crushed Lee Chong Wei yesterday, who's easily one of the greatest players of the game. 
  He is undoubtedly the best among all Indian Badminton Players. On top of it , he has got a very calm and focused attitude towards the game and that's what makes a player so great to watch. I think this is quite historic. Badminton is not a niche sport. It would rank No 3 as the most played sport in the world i would suggest after Football and Basketball.  

And to be top in such a sport to me at least is an achievement at par with what Anand achieved, for an Indian. Cricket doesn't count.  Kudos to him!!! Undoubtedly a huge achievement. Wow!

Saw if there's anything on meetup and nothing. I've seen most of the sightseeing places it has to offer. Fellow Mumbaikars what are some fun social activities to do within Mumbai?",RantsnShitpostsIndia," Stand up gigs, Theatre, Cafes that have board games, Cycling groups? It seems you are just a couch potato.

there are tons of things to do in Mumbai. So many user groups you can join. So many activities. What do you like to do the most? or what is your idea of having fun?

You can join gym, or some sports activity in sports club. Or you can team up with locals and play sports in public grounds. Also there are adventure activities near beaches. like motor sport, etc.. learn to draw / paint. Music classes.. many things to do.

which part of city are you from? Most stuff listed on Meetup is expensive imo, even more so  if you want something every weekend.  Bombay and nothing to do? 

Your options are limited only by your imagination.

Things to do:
1.	Exercise in a public free gym (like the one in front of Race Course) (would be funny AF)
2.	Take a picture infront of I love Mumbai
3.	go for a drive around the sea link
4.	go to Khandala
5.	visit CLC or any standup comedy show
6.	see a Theater (heard opera house is back)
7.	 visit NCPA (literally there's something new to do everyday!)
8.	visit world trade center (check before going)
9.	visit Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium
10. visit the zoo
11. Visit the aquarium
12. If you play any sport there's plenty if places, public ones like Smash or private clubs
13. Visit the library (at Horneyman circle, I'm forgetting the name)
14. Go shopping? (At the place infront of Bombay Gymkhana or Colaba)
15. visit a gaming parlour (one in Forjet street)
16. Visit the modern art Gallery (Jahagir?) Check what's at display
17. Visit Khyber (since you don't wanna eat) gawk at MF Hussain's Murals (Islam friendly, face is defaced)
18. See a movie at Eros (1st row balcony and keep you feet up on the railings and enjoy the best sound in a theatre)
19. Crash a private screening/ censor show (Thursdays at Eros upper floor, or CBFC building at Pedder Road) at your own risk.


On top of my head... But I'm tired of typing more....
Born and raised in Mumbai, never bored.

If nothing to do,

How much truth/honesty do you think there is in IPL? I've seen poeple make bizzare claims like Dawood Ibrahim (and presumably big business-owners) have a solid control over IPL - the fixing and betting aspects of it. ",kupKACHES," Ee sala cup namde. üòÅ As serious as my nofap program. I don't take them seriously at all. I enjoy the sport. That's good enough.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYlk4izYVmw&feature=youtu.be This whole sub is filled with such people. Just look at any post related to cricket more than half the comments are about how it's a shitty sport, all matches are fixed or some other shit like that. The thing is they hate cricket they just need a reason to shit on it. This is India. Any thing and every thing can be fixed. Hum fix kar lenge bhayya... But what is the point even if it is fixed. There will be no actions. Even if there are actions, they will be on obscure reasons, not the real reason. Even if some one gets axed, it would be attenders/clerks..not the big wigs. It's well known that D company has been active in match fixing since the 90s. They continue to stay rich and powerful and out of jail, and every billionaire and actor/politician bends over backwards to own an ipl team. If I had an operation that made crores everytime a match would be fixed, then I'd try to fix every match. 

I'm not saying every match is definitely fixed, but I'm sure serious efforts are made to fix every match. The game outside the game is just as serious. Not just cricket, but every major sporting event where money is bet is at risk of corruption.

Watch this new documentary, https://youtu.be/uYlk4izYVmw I am that guy am i the only one here who has had too much cricket already? whether it be fixed or not i just don't give a fuck anymore. Cricket is sports politics, when politicians in India are corrupt, I don't see why sports people can't be corrupt. I've heard many of friends who bet saying they got a ‚Äòtip' on how much a specific person will score , how much a team will score and the winning team. It's not always true but sometimes it's spot on accurate. Its fixed, bru. IPL is just about converting black money to white. Sahi Pakade Hai !! Doubt entire matches are fixed as there are too many moving parts. Smaller bets (number of runs/fours/sixes/extras in an over) are easier to fix as sometimes, it requires just the bowler to comply.

There can be legitimate tips, like X person is hiding an injury. Team management also have inside info that they might sell. Then, the broker will upsell this to some punter as a ‚Äúhot tip‚Äù sure thing. 

‚Äúall players are indirectly giving signals to each other and basically say each and every ball is fixed‚Äù
Yes, teams have a game plan and usually some plan as to what to bowl. 

My wild theory is that there are competing match fixers who fix against each other. 
My realistic theory is that brokers try to fix a lot of things and obtain a lot of secret info with varying success. They sell these tips to punters as ‚Äúfixed tips‚Äù while the serious punters only get the pukka fixes

"2 years working for an Indian tech firm taught me a lot, both about Indians and about myself.",910,5x3ht0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5x3ht0/2_years_working_for_an_indian_tech_firm_taught_me/,271,"Hey there /r/India. I'm an American who, several years ago, happened (quite by chance) to find myself working for an Indian tech firm. I was hired by a US company to do some general office work, but was quickly picked up by the Indian firm and worked on contract for two years. In that time I was immersed in the generosity, thoughtfulness, and compassion that I've found to be a common thread among many Indians I've met through my life.

My role in the company wasn't terribly important, but I was generally the first non-Indian point of contact for the newly-hired and recently-transferred. Many of the other Americans I worked with were resentful of the foreign labor and were either passive aggressive about it or actively aggressive (they went so far as to bring a case to the US government claiming their jobs were stolen by immigrants). I tried my best to ensure our people's first impression was more positive, and treated everyone as respectfully as I would like to be treated.

It paid off! I was quickly accepted as not only a co-worker, but as a friend. I attended barbeques and work-functions regularly, learned about Indian religion, culture, and philosophy, and shared some delicious community lunches (once a week everyone brought something, and everyone shared). The earnestness with which my co-workers asked about my marriage, my plans, my happiness, never ceased to amaze me.

The experience left me wanting to be a more attentive member of my community, whatever that community is. I am not naive enough to lump every Indian into the same category and assume that my good experiences can be transposed on others, however it struck me that the differences were more cultural than anything.

For instance, Indians I have met tend to be vastly more empathetic than Americans. American culture is extraordinarily self-centered, and as a result empathy is largely stunted or absent in most individuals. At my company, however, the Indians I worked with formed a small community of their own and really seemed to care for the well-being of everyone involved.

Another point I've noticed has been a much stronger emphasis on family among Indians. As Americans we are taught that we make or break it on our own. This is starting to change as the economic market has more and more young adults living at home still, but it is generally seen as shameful to still rely on or live with parents at any age past 18. The only thing more shameful is to be an adult who relies on their children. However family was by far the biggest motivation for most of my co-workers to be working abroad, or even to have gone into the tech industry - they wanted a successful job so they could care for their wives and husbands, children and parents. It was wonderful, and has led to me having a much better relationship with my own family as a result, which in turn has made me a more loving and thoughtful person in general.

The last thing I'd like to point out is the difference in Indian patriotism when compared to Americans. Today, American patriotism revolves around the idea of superiority, whether through morality, wealth, or force. Americans simply like to be better than other people. The founders of our country are revered today not because of their teachings, but because they are seen as having fought tyranny and won. When my Indian colleagues spoke of India, they spoke of its great thinkers and leaders and of their religion, not for their accomplishments, but for how they taught India new ways to think.

I have never been to India, and it's possible I never will, but I have been fortunate enough to see a small piece of India that some of my friends brought with them to America. I'm deeply troubled by recent events, not only referring to the recent shooting of two Indians here, but to the social climate as a whole. Our country is made weaker by the intolerance and ignorance of its leaders and lawmakers, and I'm saddened that so many people cannot see anything but their own fears.

I hope this doesn't come off as preachy or condescending - I work nights so I've been piecing this together on my downtime, and my only intent is to share my perspective. Stay safe, and thanks for reading.",SquatchHugs," thanks for sharing your experience. Really happy to you know you liked working with some of us. [deleted] Came here to read a post bashing Indians, but now pleasantly surprised after reading the whole thing. Thanks for sharing this.  good post. converse is also true. just as the very things you talked about that you learnt from indians are important in life, it's also important to be your own person, responsible for your own life. it's important to take up challenges and win and excel at it. it's important to have some form of self-centeredness where you don't sacrifice your own happiness all the time for everyone around you. truth be told, these qualities do represent polar ends and it's probably good to be comfortable with mixing and matching these qualities to enhance your life. 

there's racists among indians too who dismiss americans as being self-centered and a bit clueless about the rest of the world to the point of being stupid. not untrue when looked at from a certain lens. but there's tons to admire about americans too (and only americans. not even europeans). if i have to pick one thing, it is the ability of americans to do something with such great passion and work so hard for it that they end up making a science out of it and start defining the standards. very few indians do this sort of a thing.

let me give some examples. take a look at english sports vs american sports. american sports may have derived from english sports, but americans were the ones to develop a sport science around those derived sports and drive it to levels of professionalism previously unthinkable. this got re-exported back to british sports like cricket and rugby around the 2000s. there's a stark difference between pre-2000s british sports, which mostly looked rather amateurish vs post 2000s british sports.

another example is weed. india has smoked weed for many thousands of years. yet it is seen as a random intoxicant that has been banned. you just get generic stuff in india with hardly any well known strains. but in the US, there's so much of breeding tech applied to it to the point where there's a HUGE difference in quality between strains developed (and being developed) in the USA vs the stuff you get in India.   OP... I cannot thank you enough for this post... lately all the recent incidents and some personal experience have put me through some confusion... this helps show that there are people out there who do see things the other way. So, thank you once again! My friend, why do you say you may never go to India? It is clear after reading your post that you MUST go to India.   
  
I'm a fellow American who has only spent a month in India backpacking, but it was the best month of my life. I am dying to go back.  
  
If you want some travel advice or budgeting tips etc., PM me. Do not eliminate the possibility of this trip so readily!  Who is up for showing him India? Lets do a **GoFundme** and bring him here. He can stay with me and I'll be able to show him most of South India.  Cheers. :) > I have never been to India, and it's possible I never will

Thank you for sharing your experience and why not? Ohh mate, mind a hug? If you ever come to India, hit me up, stranger. I'll show you around Hampi at the very least.  You are welcome to work in India. You would be hired in a heartbeat by any MNCs over here.  I am happy you had great time working with us. Yes we are awesome people!

> Indians I have met tend to be vastly more empathetic than Americans. American culture is extraordinarily self-centered, and as a result empathy is largely stunted or absent in most individuals.

I think exactly opposite of this, telling it based on my experience in US.

> Another point I've noticed has been a much stronger emphasis on family among Indians. As Americans we are taught that we make or break it on our own.

This is just so true.

> When my Indian colleagues spoke of India, they spoke of its great thinkers and leaders and of their religion

Yes mostly they speak. Only.

 bas kar pagle.. ab rulayega kya wow. a perfectly designed feel good post and it feels genuine.

Thanks mate. Good to know you met the right bunch. We appreciate you saying this in the wake of the Kansas incident. USA is all right when it comes to a lot of shared values. Someday soon, we'll explore space together.

Nobody can stop the democracy superpower bros. >When my Indian colleagues spoke of India, they spoke of its great thinkers and leaders and of their religion, not for their accomplishments

Ayyy...we invanted zero...OK? From an Indian working in the US, thank you for writing this up!  Thanks for your post. If you need any help understanding more about our culture and way of life, give us a shout. My wife is from Europe and she too was sceptical at first but is a huge fan now. The biggest challenge I have in explaining India is the nature of our duality. Everything you ask about India is most likely true but the exact opposite more often than not is also true.
 Maan, I came here to read some good randia bashing. Now I have a stupid grin on my face.

May you eat some good thayir sadam, also known as the food the gods eat.  Insightful post, insightful poster! Thanks a lot for your story. It is really amazing and supportive to hear positive experiences of other people with Indian communities. I also love that you interacted with people and saw their lives and voices from the inside, as opposed to just seeing things from a distance.

As an Indian living in USA, I have also experienced positive and negative aspects of American society which has given me a lot to think and learn about. It really varies from person and person, and to me, the idea of individual liberty, personal expression and private space as a sanctuary gels well with me (these being the differences), and I think, in terms of thinking in new ways and challenging the status quo, or at least enjoying the debate, is what I really find similar between the two cultures. We love debating.

On a side note,

> The earnestness with which my co-workers asked about my marriage, my plans, my happiness, never ceased to amaze me.

:)   The self-centered nature you talk about is actually more aptly explained by collectivism vs. individualism. Asian cultures work together whereas european/american cultures work as individuals. I'm  Indian but calling it self-centered is a little unfair. 

As for patriotism, India is very jingoistic. You just didn't come across it. Most likely because an Indian in America or anywhere outside of India will tend to keep their more controversial opinions to themselves. In fact, there are factions of India who applaud the anti-muslim rhetoric that has taken hold in America. To summarize just like America or anywhere else, there are good and bad people. And you met the good.

Agree with everything else and enjoyed reading your opinion from the outside. Well, that was a pleasant surprise.  You should come visit India sometime too, OP! Sure you'll love it Thanks a million for this post, OP! I'm glad you had a good experience working with Indians abroad. I'd very recently done an AMA to clear out the stereotypes held by the global community, and such posts once in a while make us feel better that people are getting to understand us. We are a huge population, and while change is happening, it will take time.

There are many people ITT and in r/india who like to diss India for no good reason, and this sometimes helps. Free hugs, mate! Thank you for sharing!! Loved reading this!  Absolutely incredible account.

I wish more of your country men were like you. Sense of community is sometimes claustrophobic when certain roles are enforced on individuals whether male or female in the blind name of community. Im sure youve seen this also. Its pretty universal. The spectrum of family life that exists in india also accounts for large numbers of people giving birth, not because they want to have kids, working ungodly hours, not for personal fulfillment or even financial enrichment but to blindly satisfy familial expectations. Again, this is a spectrum. 
Im sure having people concerned about you has a certain novel aspect to you in your own life, but im sure there are many americans also who have family systems that are similiar to the indian system that you hail so well. 
Now, specifically, in your case, a theory could be that just like any 9-12 year old indian child,all these family values appear only in terms of communication and theory. In follow through, trust me, generations of institutionalised abuse and bullying are also hidden away in many families. 
They enquired about your marriage. Try marrying one of the relatives of the enquirers. This would be litmus test on how much they want you tp be part of their family past the usual attempt to be politely friendly. 
Also, being politely friendly in india may be a lot more intense in India than in America. More inhibitions, ya know? [deleted] the comments here are very embarrassing to say the least. A simple 'thank you' to OP would suffice but NO. ""yay, an American (presumably a white man) praised us , who's  up for hosting him, let's show him India, 'balle balle' , dress him in Indian clothes, stuff his mouth with sweets, let's show him the lala land that is India(*dharma movies Lata mangeskar theme music plays in the background*) .."" 

I usually get 'you hate India, self-hate..blah blah"" the real self haters are the people falling head over heels in love with OP for his post. I am sure if OP said anything remotely close to negative these people  would lose their shit and launch into ""my country is the best country, Indus valley civilization..Holy vedas..ISRO..Blah blah"" (Never mind that from 'how to shit in toilets' to 'how to run a parliamentary democracy'  everything was taught by the British).

 The truth is it's people like you who are self-haters, it takes a white man for you to allay your insecurities and fears. By virtue of doing this, you become a  ""self-hater"". now downvote this into oblivion, and engage in circle-jerk  to make up for your insecurities.  OP, with all due respect, but you are incredibly na√Øve. I'm happy for you that you enjoyed your time there, and apparently they enjoyed you being there as well, but this entire post reads like fiction to someone who knows anything at all about India.

You speak at great length about intolerance, but the sheer amount of misogyny which exists in India is shocking. [80% of women in India](https://scroll.in/article/829205/80-indian-women-need-permission-to-visit-health-centre-5-have-sole-control-over-choice-of-husband) need to seek permission to go to a health center. Only **5%** have any independent saying in who they choose as a spouse.

It is in this context where your attacks on individualism comes across as sheltered, myopic and, yes, out of touch. Just keep in mind that many women would *kill* for having some individualism in their lives. 

Homosexuality is banned and deeply frowned upon.

There's plenty of racism in India as well. Try taking a black friend to India and you'll come to see Alabama or Mississippi as a hippie paradise. And I haven't even touched on blatant casteism, which is a unique Indian curse.

You slam individualism, but as I pointed out, if you're in the 95% group of Indian women who can't completely independently choose their own spouse or 80% of women who need permission to go to a heath center, then your rant frankly comes across as 1st world problems. It feels to me like you have it in for American culture and you're just seeking an outlet to bash it. Most of the people you worked with were most likely upper-caste brahmins who belong in the 95th percentile and are some of the most Westernised Indians. They're not representative at all.

But believe me, if you spent some time on the ground here, and actually looked at how more vulnerable groups are being treated, you'd laugh at yourself for writing something so utterly na√Øve. It's somewhat understandable since you never visited India, but then you should also refrain from dishing out opinions comparing your own country, which you obviously resent, with a country you know next to nothing about. You should have the insight to understand this, but apparently you don't.

Obviously this will be an unpopular opinion in this sub, but I couldn't help myself sighing and rolling my eyes as I read the text. Thanks for sharing!

P.S. expecting r/India to have seizures with such a positive post Did you bang any indian chicks?  What's the dating scene over there for Americans?  Did you go out and party or what? Thank you for this. Thank you for sharing something heartfelt. One man's familial slavery is another man's cozy cradle of security. You have good observation skills. Happy for you. Some time we see but don't observe..  Thank you for sharing your experience and I'm glad you had an overall positive cultural exchange. It would be nice to see more people with an open mind and attitude like this.  This for some reason made me giddy. Thanks a lot for sharing this.

As far as empathy and family is concerned, yes, it is a cultural difference, where Indians are brought up with family playing a very central role in our lives. Americans can really try to learn from that. I'm both you can say. Welcome to the family. Made me smile :) > When my Indian colleagues spoke of India, they spoke of its great thinkers and leaders and of their religion, not for their accomplishments, but for how they taught India new ways to think.

Somewhere between all the BS the current government keeps dishing out about patriotism, I feel like the true meaning of word has been lost. This post is a reminder of the things we should really be proud about. Perspective is so important.  I wish I had gold to give you. >However family was by far the biggest motivation for most of my co-workers to be working abroad, or even to have gone into the tech industry - they wanted a successful job so they could care for their wives and husbands, children and parents. It was wonderful, and has led to me having a much better relationship with my own family as a result, which in turn has made me a more loving and thoughtful person in general.

U made my day brother. Happy for you.  that was sweet! thanks for posting this, and nice to know that you enjoy the company of, some of us. 
I need so share this with some friends, its been a very low couple of weeks. Good move by modiji  And if you change the skin color to black then you get to see the dark side. It's as if white slavery is genetically passed on. IMO the intolerance is due to the recent string of incidents after Arab spring and the wave of strife driven immigration from middle east and the resultant clash of culture often having violent ends. As a result of which people have started having a second opinion about accepting migrants in their country. And increasing number of youth in India are striving to get AWAY from their family and live independent like youth in the USA. Grass is always greener on the other side.. People are people, it all equals out. Tho there are nerds and then there are NERDS! Not almost genociding entire groups of people living somewhere so that your community's families have a place to stay leads to more closely knit family culture than a survivalist family culture. Americans should try that sometime. 

After all, when they were genocided, they were assumed to be 'Indians'. Maybe if their culture survived,OP, would be living in the embrace of a universally existing warm family unit in America. wow As we all do. Without someone broadly commenting on it based on a narrow facet whether in the positive or negative. >I attended barbeques

since when did indian offices start doing barbeques - we dont have bbq's here. this fellow sounds like a phony digging for gold and karma True. And amazingly put. But with one HUGE false perception.

Firstly, you're an amazing person to make your immigrant colleagues feel accepted. A little local support in a foreign land goes a long way as a moral booster. Thank you /u/SquatchHugs And yeah, the close family ties are a thing not only in India, but the whole of Asia. And it's really nice to have family like that.

But you're so very humongously wrong about empathy. Empathy is an emotion that's largely ignored in Indian society. Very few in India are truly capable of having that emotion. I'll give a few examples;

A religious mob breaks into a house and beats the father to death and seriously injures the son in front of their own family. All this only because they ""suspected"" that the family ate beef (cow is sacred for many Hindus). A majority of Indians justified the lynching with many even calling for killing the rest of the family for consuming beef. This was followed by a a dozen more lynchings in the name of cow and religion.

A young student gets hit by a car in broad daylight on a crowded street. He's bleeding profusely and asks for help from onlookers. Nobody helps. He dies 4 hours later ON THE STREET.

Organisations openly responsible for massacre/pogroms/genocides of religious minorities are voted to power (One ruled for 60 years and another is currently ruling the country).

We wouldn't have have had Sati (the ritual of burning alive the widow of a dead man in his funeral pyre banned by the British in 1800s) or caste system (similar to racism and apartheid) if we knew what empathy was.

Now there were a lot of people who protested against killing for cows (they were called anti-national traitors for supporting cow killers), who take the injured to hospitals, who actively support and profess secularism, who abhor the caste system, but these type of people are hugely outnumbered by the un-empathetic.
Also, lot of empathy shown by a lot of Indians have an ulterior motive. Like if a person donates alms to the poor, its more likely that he's doing it for karma than he actually caring for their well being. If a person is vegetarian it's mostly because he believes meat is unholy and not because he feels for the animals.

And there's this huge group of Indians who actually strongly believe that Indians are genetically and intellectually superior to all other races and civilizations.

Patriotism these days has turned into vitriolic nationalism. To the extent that recently a few physically disabled and elderly people were assaulted for not standing up when the national anthem was being played.

My point is, generalizing a population is dangerous and can lead to great evil (Remember the holocaust? Yeah, product of generalization). We Indians are as good or bad as anybody else. Hopefully all those things you liked about us remains for some more time .

The age of broadband has everyone turning into mini USA in India .( A small percentage but it's increasing) 

 We Indians are a Simple Men.

We See Whait People Praising Us, Tingling our Cravings.

We Upboat the Topic Into Space.

/s Kudos, at the end of the day we are just people.  Exposure to other cultures broadens your horizons.  Even in India there is almost a different language,food, culture with each state.  We Indians can also have reservations mingling with each other but interaction is the first step to overcome the stereotypes embedded in our minds. >The last thing I'd like to point out is the difference in Indian patriotism when compared to Americans. Today, American patriotism revolves around the idea of superiority, whether through morality, wealth, or force. Americans simply like to be better than other people. The founders of our country are revered today not because of their teachings, but because they are seen as having fought tyranny and won. When my Indian colleagues spoke of India, they spoke of its great thinkers and leaders and of their religion, not for their accomplishments, but for how they taught India new ways to think.

Unfortunately, this has changed in the present day and age. Patriotism and nationalism in India is seen in a similar manner as you say Americans do. I understand that you have a bunch of right wing loonies in the state who believe that the US is exceptional in the world and the best. While we in India can't really claim to something like that, we have a bunch of our own right wing loonies who accuse western (aka American) culture of being corrupt, of family values being lost and generally as Indian culture being superior due to its..I dunno..vibrancy, heritage..history..or some other crap.

Indian patriotism these days is not really about different ways of thinking, but instead, avoiding talk of our flaws and dressing up our culture and way of life (which can be really backward and primitive sometimes) as superior. Indians outside India, surprisingly, act very different (in a positive manner) than Indians in India. Seen this from personal experience over many years.

Nonetheless, great you had such an awesome experience!

I hope that attitude transfers to Indians here in India and we'd be dandy. Don't worry there is a lot of intolerance in India also. People beat up people from other states for stealing their jobs - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_attacks_on_Uttar_Pradeshi_and_Bihari_migrants_in_Maharashtra

 ______ 
**In a first, Sachin Tendulkar to initiate debate in Rajya Sabha** 

 ______ 
Cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar will bat for the first time in Parliament on
Thursday, demanding the ‚Äúright to play‚Äù for children.

Tendulkar, who had often received flak for skipping sessions, has submitted a
notice to lead a debate on ‚ÄúRight to Play and the future of sports in India‚Äù
in the Upper House, to which he was nominated in April 2012.

This will be the first time Tendulkar will be initiating a full-fledged debate
in Parliament. Tendulkar‚Äôs notice suggests that the former cricketer wants a
constitutional right that guarantees inclusion of sports in education
curriculum and the availability of sports infrastructure for all children.

Incidentally, two months ago Prime Minister Narendra Modi called upon children
to take up sports and other physical activities as he expressed concern over
the rising number of obesity cases among Indian children.

About 180 million people in India, including 14.4 million between the ages of
two and 19, were found to be obese in a study published this year in The New
England Journal of Medicine.

**Read | A Rajya Sabha seat is wasted on members like Tendulkar and Rekha**

Tendulkar, who retired from cricket in 2013, has found Bharatiya Janata Party
member of Parliament (MP) Ranvijay Singh Judev and the Congress‚Äôs PL Punia to
support his cause, and they too have associated themselves with his notice.

‚ÄúWe are seconding his motion for discussion. I am a sports enthusiast and want
to promote sport in tribal areas,‚Äù Judev told HT.

If the government wants to go by Tendulkar‚Äôs suggestions, it has to bring a
bill‚Äîin the line of the Right to Education and the Right to Information
laws‚Äîto amend the existing law.

The only risk Tendulkar faces is that ongoing disruptions may force an early
adjournment and spoil his chances of participating in a debate for the first
time. Lawmakers across the political spectrum, however, said that given
Tendulkar‚Äôs stature and the nature of the subject, parties across political
lines may agree to the debate.

Tendulkar‚Äôs performance as a lawmaker hasn‚Äôt really matched his reputation as
a sportsman. He has so far asked just 22 questions; five of them were related
to sports. As per Rajya Sabha records, the master blaster hasn‚Äôt introduced a
private member‚Äôs bill‚Äîan avenue used by individual lawmakers to propose policy
changes. Over the last five years, Tendulkar‚Äôs attendance record is 8%,
according to PRS Legislative Research.

Odisha government to sponsor India hockey teams for 5 years,386,7y41av,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/hockey/odisha-government-to-sponsor-india-hockey-teams-for-5-years-5065470/,17,,planetof," Thats amazing. Is this the first of such an instance? That means that the tax payers sponsor Indian hockey team for 5 years. They have taken the proactive step of sponsoring the Indian hockey team, can you believe it! If every state govt. do their bit in this manner, think about all the progress we will achieve. Long live the Kalinga kingdom! Good to hear that. But I don't see any chance of increase in popularity for hockey in near future. Hockey would require much more to revive. good initiative from odisha government,,chak de india That's a great news for hockey and in general sports enthusiasts. wow thats amazing news.  Cricket you can casually play anyway but can you do same with hockey?  Sorry to play spoilsport here..

sponsoring hockey teams or hosting worldcup will not make Orissa sporting capital. We are thinking this, we are getting swayed by massive PR. Fact is sporting infrastructures sucks still. Nothing has changed. Do you know how many hockey stadiums are there in Odisha? Or hockey turfs? 10? 20? And no of turfs in Holland? Do you know there was a govt scheme to build mini stadiums in each district. Any idea how the fund was spent and end result?

Last year before hosting hockey event at Kalinga stadium, the turf was relaid. Which essentially means even this only stadium too had no turf!

And they closed the only swimming pool available at Kalinga Stadium, to accomodate the said event. And by the way the said swimming pool was revamped only 2 yrs ago using public money of crores. But who cares. The propaganda was to showcase hockey power. At the cost of swimming!!

We have two associations Hockey Odisha and Hockey Gangapur. I want a data as to how many young talents have they nurtured for sub-junior or junior levels??

Let me also add, Mr Dilip Tirkey and team who organized this massive talent development tournament, whether the finals have been played? Talents spotted? Or just PR exercise for ruling party?

Lets go to the sports hostel where junior and sub-junior players stay. Living conditions? They are supposed to get kits which they dont get. Lets not talk about sports scholarship, and admission process. A player typically pay 50k to 1 lakh to get admitted.

So I dont think their motive is to promote hockey. But to promote Naveen Patnaik and ruling party.

Govt PSU like OMC and IDCO will foot the bill. These are companies and supposed to follow 'corporate governance‚Äô but they are arm-twisted by IAS officers in management positions. These same PSU made illegal money from illegal mining. The SC fined them. They didnt pay like private companies. Paid late fines with interest. Amazing governance! Now front for uplifting hockey front to promote ruling party.

if your goal is PR, this is a comparatively bad investment. There are better PR investment opportunity and medium. To nullify the point that this will make brand 'Odisha' popular. 
RoI is calculated on goal and objectives. One cant have fluid objectives to suit its narrative. What is the objective of this move. Let govt specify. Then we can evaluate whether this is a good or bad move. On the face of it, assuming PR was objective, you judge by calculating the audience and mindshare captured. Not who is playing well. So it is common sense, no matter how much you invest, you cant beat cricket eyeballs. PR in that sense dont cut ice.

So I am not convinced at all. Although, I am not against govt sponsoring but only when their intent is genuine and all other efforts & initiatives are pursued collectively.

Odisha government is the new sponsor of Indian hockey teams.

India hockey teams have got a new sponsor. Both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs hockey
team will be sponsored by state government of Odisha. The announcement was
made by Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in New Delhi on Thursday as the
state governement has decided to support the team for a period of five years.

India men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs hockey teams were present at the function in Delhi.
Other at the function were International Hockey Federation (FIH) and IOA
President Narinder Batra, IOA Secretary General Rajeev Mehta among other
dignitaries.

‚ÄúHockey in Odisha is more than a sport, it‚Äôs a way of life, especially in our
tribal regions where children learn to walk with hockey sticks. No wonder
Odisha has produced India‚Äôs finest hockey talent. This is a first where a
state government will not just be promoting a sport within its boundaries but
will also support and nurture India hockey. This is Odisha‚Äôs gift to the
nation,‚Äù Patnaik said.

Though no details of the deal were revealed, Odisha government unveiled a logo
that will be on the jerseys donned by players of both teams. The new logo is a
summation of Odisha ‚Äî the Konark Wheel, the state‚Äôs famed coastline,
endangered Olive Ridley turtles, Odissi dance form and hockey.

In the past, Odisha has produced some of India‚Äôs top hockey players including
Dilip Tirkey, Ignace Tirkey and Lazarus Barla. Four players in the current
team, Birendra Lakra, Amit Rohidas, Deepsan Tirkey and Namita Toppo, are also
from Odisha.

Now, the state has hosted a number of big hockey evers including the 2014
Champions Trophy and the Hockey World League Final 2017. This year, the
capital of Odisha, Bhubaneshwar will host the World Cup in Novenber December.

At the function, Batra said that Bhubaneshwar has emerged as the new sports
capital of India. ‚ÄúI would request the Govt of Odisha to come up with a High
Performance Centre for elite athletes. Like Delhi is the capital of India,
Bombay the financial capital of the country, Bengaluru IT capital, for me
Bhubaneswar is the sports capital of the country,‚Äù Batra said.

What we had said is that we will deduct the prize money that they get from their employer, in case of any, from the total reward money.‚Äù i think this is again an attempt to round up jats by bjp as sports is dominated by jats in haryana. jats get a lot of flak but non-jat communities of haryana are actual rss or bjp patrons (punjabi khatri, brahmins, agarwals, yadavs). you will rarely find a jat gowrakshak.

"[NP] Deepika Padukone, Virat Kohli amongst Time's 100 most influential people. What exactly do they influence?",31,8dkzrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8dkzrm/np_deepika_padukone_virat_kohli_amongst_times_100/,23,"Every few months I see such articles where Time / Forbes etc lists some bollywood personnel / cricketer as influential person.

Ex : https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ola-co-founder-bhavish-aggarwal-deepika-padukone-virat-kohli-among-times-100-most-influential-people-1840040

I am wondering, that exactly are they influencing? Have they influenced any policy / good habits / campaigned about something like rape/molestation etc .. ? Heck, Akshay Kumar with Padman & Toilet has taken up social issues and should be there instead.",Android_Arsenal," The one who influences society in a good way must be included in the list of most influential person.It should be dependent on their fans or followers. They influence media. [removed] Ads. Big corporations depend on ad agencies who in turn depend on big celebs to sell their shit. Lauda mera. They do. The common man takes to heart what they say. Virat as the captain of the National Cricket team is uniquely positioned since India is a cricket crazy nation (and that‚Äôs the only sport we have been any good at recently.) People lap up what he says. 

 Virat is largely responsible for transforming Indian cricket into a more professional body in terms of work ethics and fitness. As a player, whether you like him or not, he is undoubtedly significant. His numbers speak for him. Moreover, things like how he went to play the domestic match right after his father died, or his physical transformation into such a fit athlete really inspire a lot of people. Same goes for his go-getter attitude.

I'm a Kohli fan so I'm just writing to let you know that outside of dubious media coverage, Virat is capable of real world influence. It's because of him I hit the gym everyday and make sure to not compromise on my work. I'm biased, sure, but my reasons for why he is my role model are plain. But, I can understand why this may not be the case for others.

Deepika, on the other hand... Cricket players are just overrated, overpaid and simply unworthy. But why Deepika, I cannot comprehend.",Sports,2018-04-20 12:40:17

Want to see India in Top 20 football teams in next 5-7 years. Ohh boy!!!
This world cup is going to be awesome.

C'mon little dudes let's attack the hegemony of cricket and establish football as a major sport in the nation.

Actually looking forward to it now. I am a big football fan and this news is very positive for Future Football in India.They have beaten Azzuri's which are considered to be big Football Giant which itself is an achievement.
Most of their Players plays for big clubs like Juventus,Parma,SS Lazio and Milan.
Another news is that former wolves captain Danny Bathh has wished to play for India National Football Team with British Passport. Sports Minister Vijay Goel is looking forward to meet him to discuss about his future with National Team.His presence would definitely boost the Morale of our Team. I don't want to spoil this party. But Seria A selections are on and most of the better Italian players are back in Italy trying out for the big teams. I bet they fielded the not-so-good players. Either case, congrats to the local boys! Were Italy playing their real team or any makeshift team according to the level of the Indian team?

Hows that yearly goals w.r.t fitness? Hitting your PRs?Tried the trek route you wanted?Running a little faster than when you started a few months back?Any changes to the lifestyle to attain a more healthier approach?

Discuss your workouts and share it with others.
",root_su," Finished my 1st 10 km race in 47 minutes. Didn't expect such good timing. [deleted] Went from lean 4 pack to potbelly unkill in 5 months. Started with power lifting and results are better than cardio. Would recommend to those who want to lose weight  I am in my 20s and my weight is 79kg and i wear 34 Inch Jeans & Denims.

I am currently into powerlifting. 
My PRs are as follows :

* Squat : 320 pounds (145kg)
* Dead lift : 320 pounds
* Bench press : 230 pounds (104kg)

>YOY my dead lift and squat has improved but bench press is in a plateau. Hopefully will improve it.

Diet - Strict vegetarian. For all the veg cry babies in this thread soyabean, tofu and cheese are not the only options.

* Protein and carb sources - Lentils, legumes, beans, milk, oats, fruits and green leafy vegetables.

Masoor dal and Mung bean green are my favorite. Light and fibrous yet protein heavy.  

* Fat sources - Peanut butter, Milk ,Almonds, Cashew nuts and walnuts.

Total daily protein intake is around 120 gm.

 I have depression(go figure I am on r/india) so I have currently taken a drop from studies.I want to try and get fit and have heard it will help in that too.I was thinking of running because I like that.I hate exercising though.

Can anyone tell me any good steps to get started? I just cant bring myself to it and procrastinate.I really do want to change ordered a fitness band. that's the only progress. :( 
 [deleted] Im really weak i think the reason is my vegetarian diet and i dont want to break it what can i do to be a little stronger.  I really need help. My work timings are 1 to 10 in the evening. I am not able to wake up early and work out, I have tried everything from keeping my phone/alarm 20 ft away from the bed to asking my wife to throw me out of the bed. I am 5'6 and 95 kg, Need to reduce atleast 25 kg and not sure where to start. I have zero motivation to workout and get back in shape. Every night I read tons of motivational quotes and videos of Ali, Dwayne Johnson, Virat Kohli but every morning it is the same story, i refuse to get out of my bed.  Hi guys.

I am M,33 years old, around 72 kgs,5ft.9
daily i do 15 pushups after waking up at 11 am.sleep at 1 in night.
no work out since 6 months. 
before that also worked out only 10 days.
before that work out in 2000 .

how do i start again?

problems - hard to focus, overthinking, snacks, sweets cravings .

please guide way to start and be on track and not give up.

cheers.

 this should be a weekly thread OP how do i lose weight with a bad back? i eat clean but really, how do i do any activity that makes me sweat if i can't run or do any other high intensity exercise?  Any good trekking spots near Mumbai that isn't too crowded? Anyone can give me some advice on how not to eat like a pig during dinner. The only reason I am not losing weight is my diet . Never been on a proper diet my whole life and I am just unable to cut calories. How do I learn that self control ? [deleted] Been working out for a while now. Real good improvements in all the major lifts. Can deadlift 140kgs. Touched 80kgs recently. Will be cutting for the next 4 weeks. Never felt better. Ask any questions if you have wrt lifting or nutrition.  I'm skinny af. 5'8 55kg.It's not possible for me to go to a gym. What should I do to bulk up? Increased my bench press to 30 kg.Have stalled on 25 kg for so long started following ppl routine never felt better.

Edit: Bc 15 kg ki  rod bhi saath mae. going on lcd before Diwali happens so I can eat all I want then and not get fat. Hitting gym as well as calisthenics at home, eating clean, cheat meals on weekends tho. 

Current PR :-
Overhead press - 40Kg,
Squat - 70 kg,
Benchpress - 80 kg,
Deadlift - 125kg

Age - 20,
Height - 5'6,
BodyWeight - 60.5 kg

 I started going to gym 2.5 months back. Didn't miss any Mon-Wed-Fri, until last monday. I can't go till Friday because caught up in something. I know my body isn't stupid to get rid of muscles because I've to skip gym for 12 days, but I'm worried I won't have the same motivation to get back in routine.  I'll note down something that really worked for me which I don't see many people talking about in this context.

Meditation and fasting. I'd Particularly recommend this If anyone here already has a bit of a practice with meditation, I'd say fast for a day on the weekend when you're free and meditate more on that day, it's a lot easier for me to go from having an unsupervised/casual (but not disgusting) diet to eating like a pig but to keep myself on ""pandit mode"" and restrain myself from eating casually/without thinking is exceedingly easy after you start.

There's also all the benefits of meditating.  Did a 80m lap of Tyre Flips in 1""09' and ran 1.5km in 6 minutes on the same day. 

Feelsgoodman. Plateaued on Keto at 65kg (5'6''), now back on the normal diet and started gym a week back. Can't feel any better.

1 hour of weight training followed by 30sec bursts of High interval cardio, you can really hear your body's cry.. Not exactly into body building. Just want to be in a good shape, visible abs and a decent chest. 

Haven't hit the gym in 4 months. Belly fat creeping up.

Started a strict diet yesterday. Hopefully, will get back in shape in 2-3 months.

 Doing pretty well. Steadily losing weight. I'm doing swimming now after quitting running.

Swam a pool length after a month of practice! Woohoo! But I have a cold which has started about a fortnight back which doesn't seem to quit. Any suggestions? I am 5' 11 and 91kg. Started cardio from August mostly 3/4 days a week. 

Just hit 30 min for 5k. Almost two months are over, happy to see progress in distance and pace but literally no weight loss. Have reduced my eating too. 

Should I start HIIT/Powerlifting?  Please leave a space after the '?'. Thank you. Could Intermittent Fasting and cardio be recommended to a 27 year old male to reduce fat ? I know the answer is counting calories, strength training etc. But I just want to recommend a quick and easy plan for a person to follow to lose weight and to get started in fitness.

I don't think there is a need to do running or even marathon-level training for general cardio fitness or weight loss - would a walk a day suffice or is more programming recommended ? Started to care since May about my weight, and I lost 11 kgs toll date. At 89 now, for 6'2 height.

I like it.  Lost 9 kilos this year. The aim was 20. There's still some time left to go. Will I? Won't I? I've developed a pot belly so I wanted to join the only gym available in my locality . The instructor there is a noob, he made me do crunches straight up which I don't  think is a good idea to lose weight or a good idea in general.
I've read stuff on the Internet but I don't know what works . 


Any suggestions what should I begin with , this is my first time in gym  Lost 10 kgs this year.  Happy \m/ 5-6 kilos in about 50 days  (and 8 kilos in 4 months) through a combination of a caloric deficit + high-protein diet, some swimming, some gymming and loads of walking.  Jump rope !!!! 

Check out this YouTube channel ZendudeFitness. Plain jump rope workout channel.

When I started off watching them, they were very new to YouTube. Initially they looked  like douchebags, shirtless and jumping rope in public. I love watching them now, because they have taught me so much. From basics to advanced.i lost 5 kG doing their workout routine need to lose fat from belly, thigh and butt area...
height: 5'8
weight: 72kg
whole day goes in seating, morning to evening in college and after that in front of pc... 
few months ago i brought weight to 67 by fasting but now it is back to 72...
want flat tummy and fit body and i also need to increase my strength... 
any tips?  I wake up in the morning and run, after that there are other cardio stuff like punching, push ups, kicking, pull ups, etc. Most of it is done within an hour. 

But for some reason my running causes irritation to others. While other people jog, talk, and walk in the morning, I just run as fast I can for a Kilometer at least. This means passing fat fuck degenerate aunties and unkils who keep telling me *beta dhere*, *isko kis chor dia*. Bhag BC, the amount of calories this fuckers lose in a year, I lost that in one fuckin run, and they object to me running. I've thought about buying that thing you plug into the wall for running but I don't see why I should? Isn't the point of exercise to lose calories, be fit and pumping?  ",Sports,2017-09-22 17:05:31

India vs Pakistan Hockey: India humbled Pakistan at the Olympic Park in searing heat. India vs Pakistan Hockey: India humbled Pakistan at the Olympic Park in searing heat.

India and Pakistan have enjoyed contrast results and performances so far in the Hockey World League 2017 in England. On one hand India have won two in their two matches ‚Äì beating Scotland 4-1 and Canada 3-0. Pakistan have had opposite results with two straight defeats. That trend continued on Sunday as India thrashed Pakistan 7-1 in an all round show. Harmanpreet, Akashdeep and Talwinder scored two goals each while Pardeep Mor chipped in with one.

India vs Pakistan Hockey Score and Updates: India looked extremely confident and convincing in the win against Canada with all three goals coming in the first half. Pakistan, though, are yet to open their account in the tournament.

1953 hrs IST: Pakistan‚Äôs misery is not done. GOAL!! Akashdeep Singh hammers the ball into the roof of the goal from a narrow angle. INDIA NOW 7-1 up!

1950 hrs IST: Pakistan earn a fourth PC. Under four minutes to go and chance for Pakistan to get a consolation goal but Bilal‚Äôs shot is a mistrap but the attack is not over. GOAL! Pakistan open their account in the tournament through Muhammad Umar Bhutta. He‚Äôs unmarked at the far post and gets the ball in

1945 hrs IST: Pakistan switching keepers now. Amjad Ali goes out and Hazar Abbas comes in. Amjad hasn‚Äôt had a bad game but let down by the defence

1941 hrs IST: GOAL!! India are humiliating Pakistan here. 6-0! Pakistan lost 0-6 to Canada and have now let go six to India. This would hurt more for sure. Pardeep Mor finds the tiniest of angle to beat the Pakistan keeper

1940 hrs IST: Akashdeep has scored a goal in each of the three games to take his tally to three goals

1938 hrs IST: GOAL!! Akashdeep Singh once again scores. Neat first touch to create little space and angle for himself and gets the shot on. Nothing that Amjad Ali could do to stop that

1936 hrs IST: India coach Oltmans: Important for us to keep the ball and maintain the possession. We have had some fantastic field goals which has been great to see

1934 hrs IST: Plenty of chances for both teams in the third quarter but India have added one and it could very well have been more. Pakistan, too, could have been on the scoresheet but for some big saves by Dahiya and Chikte

1931 hrs IST: SHOT! Chenglansana with the shot from inside the area but Amjad Ali gets down quickly low to push the ball away. Had it not been for Amjad, Pakistan would have been in far bigger trouble

1924 hrs IST: Pakistan go for a reverse hit shot but it gets an Indian foot it seems. Third penalty corner for Pakistan. Mahmood gets the shot on this time and Dahiya gets the stick on it to push it over. He has been spectacular today. Immediately Pakistan win a fourth PC and this time too Mahmood gets the shot on target and this time it is down and low to the keeper‚Äôs right and it is saved!

1919 hrs IST: India get a fourth penalty corner. They‚Äôre 1/3 today. GOAL!! Harmanpreet Singh scores! Bang to the left of the keeper. Not kept low or high but comfortable height but hit fiercely and India lead 4-0!

1918 hrs IST: Pakistan, like first half, with good start. Shot on target and it is saved by Vikas Dahiya. Over on the other hand, India have a shot attempted but it is narrowly wide

1918 hrs IST: Second half underway. India get the ball rolling and they lead 3-0 comfortably

1907 hrs IST: The hooter goes and India deservedly lead Pakistan 3-0 at half time. Two goals from Talwinder and one from Harmanpreet Singh

1906 hrs IST: After some terrible play from Pakistan in the middle of the pitch, Ramandeep Singh has a chance at the goal. Defended first, then gets a shot which is saved by the keeper. In the end it is cleared away to safety

1902 hrs IST: Pakistan go for the video referral and it is a successful one. Penalty corner denied for India.

1901 hrs IST: Vikas Dahiya coming into action once and twice in the past few minutes but not enough to create much trouble or concern for the Indian defence. India led 3-0 against Canada in the first half and let the momentum drop. Unlikely they‚Äôd do the same today

1858 hrs IST: GOAL!! India are running riot over Pakistan. Talwinder Singh claims a second now. Video referral to see whether Talwinder got the hand or back of the stick but nothing wrong with that. The goal stands. India are 3-0 up!

1854 hrs IST: GOAL!! SV Sunil deflects the ball in the Pakistan goalmouth but it is Talwinder who gets the final touch. Lovely play down the left from Sardar Singh to open up that much space and then double the lead. India are now 2-0 up!

1852 hrs IST: India have a chance to double their lead as they win their third PC of the match. Harmanpreet gets good contact on this one. It is destined for the top of the goal but Pakistan keeper Amjad Ali remains agile to push the ball away. Good save that

1848 hrs IST: Second quarter gets underway with Pakistan‚Äôs second penalty corner of the match. Good grab and collect but the effort from Bilal is easily wide of the mark

1846 hrs IST: At the end of the first quarter, India lead Pakistan 1-0 thanks to Harmanpreet Singh.

1842 hrs IST: Pardeep Mor moves down the right and tries to wiggle his way through into goal and it hits a Pakistan foot. Second PC of the match for India. GOAL!! Not the best connection with the ball and that looks to have deceived the Pakistan keeper Amjad. Harmanpreet Singh has India in the lead after 13 minutes ‚Äì his second in the tournament

1837 hrs IST: Very cagey so far in the first quarter from both sides. First PC of the match for Men in Green. Bilal gets the shot on but the effort is over the goal. On further look, it clipped the top of the goal and went over

1832 hrs IST: India have been 1/6 on PC‚Äôs and they have the first of the match. And that tallies gets worse as the chance goes waste

1831 hrs IST: Ajaz Ahmed has a great chance to open Pakistan‚Äôs scoring account but his shot goes past Dahiya and across the face of goal. Big chance early on for Pakistan as India are caught napping

1828 hrs IST: The 160th contest between the two teams is underway. Pakistan get the ball rolling

1825 hrs IST: The teams. Vikas Dahiya once again remains in goal for India in place of Akash Chikte

I was looking for the hockey match today, stumbled upon some weird game. It featured players with India Pakistan jerseys, but for half the game 9 of Pakistan's players were benched, for the other half 9 of India's. Their ground was pretty weird too. They had tiny goal posts, with three wooden posts, in the middle of the ground, with only one goal keeper standing not in front of the stumps but behind it! And the two non carded players from each team were playing with pads!

A very strange game - one player kept handling the ball, the rest didn't have sticks, and the two padded ones had weird outsized ones! Very, very strange. 

Anyway, good hockey game today, and an expected result.  Dekha. Hamne father's day ko yeh saabit kar diya ke baap baap hota hai aur beta beta hota hai. Mauka mauka I would first like to congratulate and be great full for a wonderful channel called NDTv India, the Hindi channel, to first plant this news in their channel and the other about srikanth's win, when during that moment, the rest of all the Hindi channels , were pom-poming about Virat Kohli's double century which he was supposed to score ahead. It was a nauseating circus show in a frikkin news channel. With musicals, Bhakts, flags in the studios probably more than they do on 15th August. One channel also showed tin foil hat comedy hour of Vinod Kambli, with 0 humor in it. 

It was an absolute display of blind patriotism  without focusing on other things as well. Yes, I switched to NDTV which have shown the respect and praises that Srikanth got over there for his achievement.

And India cheered for a game which they deservingly lost, but never cheered for the game which won but they never see. Only now they would do it because people heard the news after realizing their favorite game isn't doing well.

Fuck you India, with the bottom of my heart. You bigoted nation should be maped out of this world.It has enough shits already, they certainly don't need yours.Dual faced asswipes. ""Hockey>Cricket"".Indian media right now This is great achievement by the gov, but the anti national, biased, paid media is not reporting it. Instead fabricated negative news about cricket loss is being spread to show India and Modiji in bad light. Send this to all your family and friends. Isko itna share karo ke iss jeet ki goonj Pakistan tak pahunche. One share one salute. Jai hind.  We showed them. Jai hind. BMKJ Well that's a nice enough consolation, I would have prefered a double treat obviously  Of course hockey is India's sport. We have won a total of 8 Olympics gold medals in hockey.

And we would have continued to dominate hockey at the highest levels if we weren't hampered by the change to artificial turf.

But now we have the means to pay for the right facilities, expect to see more gold medals in the future. 
 Hum tumhare mein itne goal kar denge ki confuse ho jaoge ki saans kahan se len aur paaden kahan se.. Hockey is dead sport in South Asia. Talk about the cricket match bro. lol Mostly, we Indians only love Cricket and do not care much about other sports like Hockey or Basketball or Wrestling, but because now India lost the match from Pakistan, we are trying to convince ourself that other games are also very important and matter to the country and we are winning all those from Pakistan.

Let‚Äôs call it what it is: Jallikattu IS animal cruelty,144,5op4a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5op4a5/lets_call_it_what_it_is_jallikattu_is_animal/,526,"Let me start off saying that the Supreme Court was hypocritical in banning the sport but is a step in the right direction. And yes, testing medicine and makeup on animals, racing, zoos, the rodeo, and a million other things are various degrees of cruelty. I am lapsed vegetarian and I never have and never will try to stop anyone from consuming meat. This post is the most I am willing to do to make noise about the things we can do better but I recognize that it is bad and morally indefensible. There is no argument you can make for banning Jallikattu if you are ok with animal slaughter or factory farming. 


The two common arguments that the proponents are that 1) it is necessary to protect the indigenous species and 2) it is not torture


**Jallikattu is not necessary:**


I readily agree that there was a historical need for the sport to exist. Selective breeding of animals is not new or confined to the state and is still practiced elsewhere, although with a lot less cruelty.
If the intentions of the government and proponents of the sport is to save the indigenous bulls from extinction, humane alternatives like artificial insemination and co-op reproductive center are absolutely possible. Everyone outside TN are doing it, why can‚Äôt we? 


Conspiracy theories apart, there is a reason why other species of cows are popular. They give more milk. I‚Äôm ready to concede that the A2 variety of milk is better. For that, we need more indigenous cows and any way, other than Jallikattu is a more humane way of procuring it.  


A bull can fuck a cow without us meddling. 


**Jallikattu is animal cruelty:**


This is a real slippery slope and we need to be intellectually honest about it.


If we can have a rational discussion on the topic and be honest, we have to agree that punching, kicking, pulling the tail, grabbing the horns, force feeding liquor, keeping it in confine spaces are all‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcruelty.


The bulls are put in a simulated hunting scenario where 200 men chase it for honor. The bull is either running for its life, trying to defend its territory or both. If there was any other animal in that scenario, no sensible person would see it as anything but cruelty. Is it okay for someone to forcibly make you run for your life one-day year while being pampered the rest the year? It is undoubtedly mental torture. 

For the people who argue, that the bull and the farmer share a special relationship and it is only during Jallikattu, the bull is put through a ‚Äúmild inconvenience‚Äù, would you agree to girl being raped for one day a year and not consider it cruelty and torture if she lives at the end of the ordeal and treated like a queen the rest of the year? I will make this analogy with no apology because I believe that one of the great responsibilities we have as a society is to reduce suffering of many living things as possible.


Let‚Äôs protect our cows and bulls at all costs but it does not require this sport. India and cows share a special relationship. Let‚Äôs have all of that continue. Let‚Äôs treat respect every animal like we respect the cow. In fact, let‚Äôs have more of that but the only compromise is that we move to a new reality that doesn‚Äôt involve Jallikattu.
",ironypatrol," Ya'll I don't understand why everyone is behind banning the sport ? There were rules set forth by the government and it was followed by many organizers. Just becoz few didn't follow , how can you ban the sport ?

Why not introduce strict rules and make sure the person not following it be banned from participating in future games.

How is the destruction of native cattle breeds of India be justified ? How is artificial insemination be humane ? 

Unless you see how the jallikattu is conducted and read about people who breed and rear cattle , you cannot justify the claims made by PETA. The bulls belong to middle class men and farmers - most of them have one or two cattle of their own. Do you think they will hurt n injure their own cattle.

The cattle are like family in the south. Grown with affection n care. It is easy to criticize but to spend time and read about it. The southern native bull breeds have evolved from an aggressive genus, it is necessary for them to be reared in an sportive n challenging environment. 

Jesus people, if you want to find reasons to ban everything - Diwali causes pollution ban it. BAKRID slaughters - ban it. Bathing and dumping the dead in ganges - hell no, ban it.

 So I read up on a bit of rodeo ethics to see if it changed my mind, but the most interesting I came across was a quote from someone high up in an animal rights organization protesting rodeos: 

>""That's just fundraising hype. Of course rodeo can be fixed. But why would we care about fixing it? Rodeo is an insignificant sport, practiced by an insignificant number of people in politically insignificant places. If we take a tough line on rodeo, we bring in a lot of contributions, and don't make any powerful enemies.""

And this is clearly what PETA is doing and the SC has eaten it up. I'm not the biggest fan of the 'preserving culture' alone, I think that the cons of doing so should be looked at, and if the cons aren't that bad, then preserve it. 

>For the people who argue, that the bull and the farmer share a special relationship and it is only during Jallikattu, the bull is put through a ‚Äúmild inconvenience‚Äù, would you agree to girl being raped for one day a year and not consider it cruelty and torture if she lives at the end of the ordeal and treated like a queen the rest of the year? I will make this analogy with no apology because I believe that one of the great responsibilities we have as a society is to reduce suffering of many living things as possible.

This is the most absurd thing I've read this year, but given the vegan nuthead spirit of this post, I'm not really surprised. Morals and ethics aren't as black and white as they're made out to be in this post and lame over-exaggerations take away the little credibility this argument has. 

>The bulls are put in a simulated hunting scenario where 200 men chase it for honor. The bull is either running for its life, trying to defend its territory or both. If there was any other animal in that scenario, no sensible person would see it as anything but cruelty. Is it okay for someone to forcibly make you run for your life one-day year while being pampered the rest the year? It is undoubtedly mental torture.

I mean what the fuck is this? The bulls are grabbed onto right out of the gates and I have no idea what you're on about with defending territory. It's fair to say that they might be scared coming out of the gates due to the number of people, but again, you've massively exaggerated. Most cows (unless trained otherwise) will buck to get a weight off their back (most adults will rear and shake their heads if you leave your hand on their head, I've only ever gotten a calf to be comfortable with me petting his head), and this is the mechanism being exploited in Jalikattu. To say that this fear is mental *torture* is yet another wild exaggeration. And then you've somehow ended with another exaggeration asking if people would run *for their lives* once a year. 

Now would those bulls be better off if they didn't have to put up with those 30 seconds? Sure. I'm not going to pull the 'they wouldn't exist without Jalikattu' card because to me that's not really the question. The question to me is if Jalikattu can be conducted without cruelty, and to me the answer is yes. Like I said before, morality and ethics are hardly black and white, but let's not pretend that this is some clear cut abhorrently cruel sport. Done properly, Jalikattu at worst should be a temporarily stressful event for the bull, it's not torture and it's certainly nowhere close to being equivalent to rape. 

Looking at the parts you define as cruel:

punching - Sure, should be able to cut out
kicking- Same as above 
pulling the tail - Same as above
grabbing the horns -  I have no idea how this is cruel
force feeding liquor - This is already illegal
Keeping it in confine spaces - This isn't ideal but unless there's something stressing out the cow within that space (like people biting its tail while confined), not seeing the cruelty


I don't expect you to jump on the Jalikattu bandwagon, but I hope you do fuck off with this holier-than-thou attitude. It's okay to not support Jalikattu, it's fine to speak out against it, but you can do it without being so pretentious. However, if you are so against it, you should be a very dedicated vegan. So when you say:

>I am lapsed vegetarian and I never have and never will try to stop anyone from consuming meat

You can absolutely fuck off, because being stressed out for less than a 30 seconds a year is nowhere close to being the form of mental torture worse than death that you're trying to make it out to be. Would you rather be forced to box the best boxer once a year for crores of cash, win or lose or *be fucking dead*? And to be honest, that's blowing out of proportion what the bull is going through, a more apt comparison is would you rather try to run through 200 ten year old children trying to tackle you for that same prize or again, *be dead*.

 Define 'humane' for me, will you?

>humane alternatives like artificial insemination

You're okay with injecting cows with sperm instead of letting them breed naturally?

>They give more milk. I‚Äôm ready to concede that the A2 variety of milk is better.

Looks like you're okay with treating them as milk machines.

>keeping it in confine spaces‚Äî cruelty.

Are you okay with cow collars and cow milking machines?


>The bulls are put in a simulated hunting scenario where 200 men chase it for honor. The bull is either running for its life, trying to defend its territory or both.



Oh, you wanna talk about how bulls feel? Okay, let's go there.

Calves are separated from their mothers and sold for money, imagine how they feel about that. Also, imagine the pain  they feel when humans milk them every day. Maybe they're playing 'comfortably numb' in their heads when that happens.


>Is it okay for someone to forcibly make you run for your life one-day year while being pampered the rest the year? It is undoubtedly mental torture.

Is it okay to drink cow's milk? Is it okay if the pet owners castrate their pets? Is it okay if people sell puppies and calves?

>would you agree to girl being raped for one day a year and not consider it cruelty and torture if she lives at the end of the ordeal and treated like a queen the rest of the year?

Would you agree to girl being milked every day in exchange for food?


>Let‚Äôs protect our cows and bulls at all costs but it does not require this sport. 


I agree, but get a ban on animal slaughtering first, then we'll talk.
 The driving reason behind the outrage and protests is the reinforcement of how Tamils feel in general - That in spite of not being represented much at the Center (something in general southern states feel), they are being singled out and targeted by having a sort of external force interfere in their age-old traditions. A similar issue is the Hindi debate. Have recently felt similar sentiments from other redditors. If they ban temple elephants, horse racing, dog shows, circuses, the leather industry, and a ton of other stuff excluding just meat, I'd at least be less irritated with the hypocrisy in the ban OT: Can someone explain what are these bunch of memes about OPS and mixture?  >  bull can fuck a cow without us meddling.

the bull that wins the jallikattu is considered alpha male and gets to fucks all cows. it is sport as well as establishment of pecking order  So is killing animals for eating.

>Jallikattu is not necessary:

Again So is killing animals for eating. There is ideological reason behind it apparently, about how Dravidian's are bull tamers and Aryans are horse tamers. This is supposed to signify the roots of Dravidian culture. Few days back a guy was explaining it to me, while it does make certain sense, in a simplistic level, I am not sure about the facts to it.

I honestly think Jallikattu issue has become so big because, tamilians feel they are being forced into ""hindification"" of India. Almost all central ads are in hindi both in newspaper and in mass media, all government programs are named in hindi, anything to do with national identity has become Hindi. Above it all tamilians looked on in serious anger after the karnataka riots over cauvery water, a supreme court judgement was literally thrown out the window, so now tamilians are feeling the same way with respect to the supreme court.

The hypocrisy of the Judicial System and Political system is out in the open, this is a slippery slope that I dont think many people understand. There are serious anti central government sentiments brewing and unless the government takes a firm stand on certain issues like cauvery water, tamil nadu is going to have continue having anti goverment/anti hindi sentiments which will blow over one fine day into violence. 

But knowing our politicians they would keep this in a simmer and turn up the heat when it works to their advantage. Riot politics is Indian politician's bread and butter. Fact is that the sport is linked to a Harvesting Festival, it is being seen as move to suppress an identity and a past time. The ban is expressly being seen as an act against the majority. Additionally, the evidence of ""cruelty"" is compiled by people (PETA) with a clear bias, who internationally don't have a stellar reputation not just in India. For these reasons alone I think Jallikatu should not be banned aaprt from the economic and social activity that the sport has.  The main reason for the protest is because when there is so many other cruelty and the like why is jallikattu the only thing that is targeted and banned while others are not even mentioned Can I be against Jallikatu and still eat beef?  Yes. But what about Bakri Eid /s double standards at play, eh? Why is Jallikattu only being singled out? TL/DR of OPs rant: If you are against Jallikattu, you are either a vegan or a hypocrite. 

In this country, where [over 70% are non-vegetarians](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/14/vegetarian-india-a-myth-survey-shows-over-70-indians-eat-non-v/) and vegans should be in single digits, most of those supporting the ban are hypocrites. OP on the other hand appears to be an exemption.

Coming to OP's arguments

>  If the intentions of the government and proponents of the sport is to save the indigenous bulls from extinction, humane alternatives like artificial insemination and co-op reproductive center are absolutely possible

So you are expecting farmers to use artificial insemination with bulls which historically produce much less milk than imported breed.

> we have to agree that punching, kicking, pulling the tail, grabbing the horns, force feeding liquor, keeping it in confine spaces are all‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcruelty

Grabbing the horns is not the same as rest. How about Jallikattu actually being about holding onto the hump? Pretty sure our neighboring cow/buffalo herder uses sticks to beat livestock.

> The bulls are put in a simulated hunting scenario where 200 men chase it for honor. The bull is either running for its life, trying to defend its territory or both. If there was any other animal in that scenario, no sensible person would see it as anything but cruelty. 

I think you have a weird idea of torture. Species A chasing species B is not torture. Even humans chasing away a tiger from a village would classify as torture. At that rate, a pride of lions chasing buffaloes, deer etc would get classified as torture. 

> Is it okay for someone to forcibly make you run for your life one-day year while being pampered the rest the year? It is undoubtedly mental torture.

Nope. It is not mental torture. Running for life is what a cow/buffalo would do in the wild. In fact, keeping animals locked up in diary farms, poultry farms instead of being given freedom of movement is actually torture. Would you like to be locked up in a space without even space to move for all of your life?

> For the people who argue, that the bull and the farmer share a special relationship and it is only during Jallikattu, the bull is put through a ‚Äúmild inconvenience‚Äù, would you agree to girl being raped for one day a year and not consider it cruelty and torture if she lives at the end of the ordeal and treated like a queen the rest of the year?

Is someone raping bulls? First time I am hearing this. Please do consider what are the other options for the bull: castration and work rest of life as slave or be killed immediately. 
It is just another animal, not a ""girl"" & men chasing it is barely similar to a ""girl being raped"" (OP's words not mine!).

I am sure OP is, for example not offended when he sees the bull walking around NAKED ..or when bulls are castrated.


> India and cows share a special relationship. 

Erm, not really. This definitely is not the case in Much of South India for example. 

Even if we assumed that some people in TN have ""special relationship with cow"", they have no business forcing their views on others. To address some major points:

 * **Saving the indigenous cow breeds.**

And then what? What then? The other side has clearly said that if not for Jallikattu, the indigenous bull breeds are sent to slaughterhouses. So it's pretty clear that the only reason these bulls are bred and the only reason to *save* the indigenous breed is for this sport and this sport alone. If saving the breed was part of a more reasonable cause like biodiversity or such, then it would've been valid. But breeding for a sport shows how limited the issue is.

 * **Is it cruelty? While there are other forms of cruelty rampant, why did the SC target only this?**

Anything that causes distress to an animal, that enrages it can be treated as cruelty. Taunting the bull and means used to cause it to go berserk are textbook cases of animal cruelty, period. Butchering the animal doesn't involve putting it through so much stress over a period of time, injecting it with chemicals, forcefully feeding it liquor etc. This is merely a first step taken towards a bigger cause i.e. curbing animal *cruelty* in all forms. 

 * **It is a traditional sport, we need to save our tradition.**

Sati was earlier a tradition that was socially accepted and endorsed by most. Does it make it morally and ethically acceptable? No. Slavery was socially accepted. Does it make it morally acceptable? No. Same is the case with several other social evils. The reason they were abolished is that they caused pain and suffering to some living being. Same is the case with Jallikattu and this is why the ban must be upheld by the SC. Times change, traditions change, we must change with the times. As the world is becoming more and more liberal, we can't be reverting back to stone age. 

* **Is it legal?**

Firstly, opposing a SC judgment is a case of contempt of Court. Secondly, though non-justiciable, A. 51A(g) of the Constitution states as a Fundamental Duty of all citizens of India to have compassion towards all living beings. Is deliberately agitating the bull being compassionate towards it? Is injecting it with chemicals being compassionate towards it? Absolutely not. 

The SC judgment is logical and rational on the several grounds that I have explained above and as enumerated in the BiCCI Press Conference and needs to be upheld. With political parties refusing to take a stand against the public on such issues due to the fear of a backlash, the onus is now on the Supreme Court to do the work of the Legislative of the country.  I agree with you. A lot of the arguments I have seen are like whatabout x, whatabout y. And I am personally all for replacing them with more humane methods if possible and outlawing them if not.  > And yes, testing medicine and makeup on animals, racing, zoos, the rodeo, and a million other things are various degrees of cruelty

Also killing animals. Let's not kill animals. Is killing the animal cruelty too or is that diet? I like that the Supreme court banner jallikattu, I hope that ban non-veg food too.  I agree with the last bit. Jallikattu can be phased out and with proper education it will be, but the issue here is to repeal the ban and the meddling of PETA. I do not subscribe to the sexed up and ridiculous ads in the name of ethical treatment.  Can u confirm if horse races are being held without feeding horses performance enhancement drugs ? So are you saying - that these horses would run like they are on fire - even when the rider is not there. And it is not running because of the rider's whipping of the horse or yanking its bit.

Did we ban Horse Races across India ? No because its rich man owned sport ? So lets not look at that  - lets go bother Tamilians.
They may take it and we can make an example out of it.


Go fix Salman Khan killing Black Buck , stop horse racing. Show you have taken care of animal cruelty acroos all Wealth bands and then I will be standing in Madurai ( TN City ) and shout my lungs out to stop JalliKatu I mostly agree with what you said. But when you say India and cows have a sacred tradition as a rationale for banning Jallikattu - I have to ask which India and which cows?

Clearly the people of TN do not hold the jallikattu bulls that sacred, given the popularity of the tradition. There's other non-Brahmin, non-Hindus who do not give two hoots about cows. So, in essence the ban is the imposition of the morality of one set of Indians on another.

Cows aren't endangered animals and we do permit other forms of animal cruelty for different reasons. So I can't see why our highest court has to specifically ban something which has significance to many. Totally agree with this and I do think banning jallikattu is the right thing to do. 

But seeing how the kannadigas got away with not giving a fuck about the SC's ruling on the kaveri issue recently, I think we should just go ahead and conduct the event regardless of what the court says, just inorder to make a point. The problem is not wholly with the ban on Jallikatu. It is a protest against hypocrisy by the supreme court regarding the cauvery water issue. Also, the last time cock fights were banned, local breeds went extinct. If you really think artificial insemination is humane, artificially inseminate you. all your arguments are irrelevant.  not to mention, wrong.

the only relevant thing is, if the people of Tamil Nadu want it and it does not concern anybody else, the central govt., should have no business whatsoever to poke their noses into it.  federalism should be non-negotiable.  the centre cannot act as if the states are merely vassals of some Emperor sitting in Delhi. *applause* [removed] As a tamilian, I agree.  Look A domesticated animal is protected under a human care. We  feed it, we vaccinate it and we provide shade and shelter. 


Without all this the life expectancy of the animals is less than half. Now would it care and place its freedom above all else? It could basically run away if it wants freedom (dont give me animals aren't sensient , They would know when they are getting sold for slaughter) 

Now, is this creulty? Yes , Absolutely. Would it matter for the animal after all the life it spent under owner's care. 

By that definition, even vaccinating children is creulty towards bacteria/virus. 


Tell you wouldn't let a pig die if its organs are useful for a human.  The ethical and economic arguments regarding Jallikattu can go either way. The real reason why the protests have exploded in the manner in which they have is because some people have really tapped into the ethnic pride of Tamils and made this an issue of identity. 

The ethical issue comes down to where one draws the line with respect to animal use and husbandry. Is rearing and killing for food okay as opposed to rearing and recreational hunting? Or are both equally inhumane. I don't believe in hunting/fishing unless it is for consumption, but some people that fish and hunt for sport. The idea that somehow meat eaters can oppose animal sports is hypocrisy is actually not hypocrisy, but whataboutery from those supporting Jallikattu.

Economically, artificial insemination is considered more expensive and less in the control of farmers, whose economic model could well be shattered by the entry of modern technology. Then it becomes the question of whether the costs of artificial insemination are worth it and whether the cruelty is actually so great that it is worth spending that money from the point of view of the farmer. 

Tbh, I don't have an opinion on Jallikattu. I can definitely see both sides of the argument. I don't like PETA because they're fanatics that are actually highly simplistic in their moral arguments against the use of animals. But unfortunately, some of the Tamil meme pages have been like Trump meme pages in that they've resorted to all sorts of lies, fabrications and falsehoods to whip up sentiments. Many average Tamilians seem to sit somewhere on the spectrum of being motivated by genuinely understandable ethical and economic reasoning and blind devotion to their identity and traditions. 

  Well, you said it yourself, your whole argument is hypocritical, and hence should be taken with a pinch of salt. 

When you come up with a better measuring stick, we'll talk. Because that's what this has come down so. 

Rationality, down the drain. Emotions, over your head.  ..In the mean time show jumping is an Olympic sport . [deleted] Tamil pride is a bullshit argument breaking the bulls tail  , that's not even the original jalikattu , the original jalikattu was about catching a gold purse on the bulls horns . Not fucking feeding it alcohol , putting chili in its nose and breaking its horns. With that same logic - be a  vegetarian. As it is animal cruelty to chickens and goats.  The point is people in north should not dictate what south should do based on their own morales. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVbZo1TlHvw  [deleted] You can have a different solution rather than just banning the sport altogether. If we are so much concerned about the way the animals are treated, Why not have strict regulations on that aspect alone. Like, keep the sport industry more regulated and have strict regulations with the people who are training and taking care of those animals. If you keep banning everything, nothing will be left. If banning is your only solution, you can argue to ban other animal related things like horse riding, zoo keeping etc., 

Remember, bull festival is there in spain and US too. And it was never so deemed to be a cruel sport because of good regulations It is not necessary, and it is animal cruelty, but it should not have been banned. We need to find that Reddit user that creates cards and ask him to create a ""rape"" card. The rape card can be used in any scenario and instantly strengthen your argument on the Internet by several folds. If this card gets pulled on you, you instantly lose the argument.  Thanks OP for giving words to my thoughts. Was really conflicted but now I think am convinced.  [deleted] I mean, are they willing to ban killing animals on Eid? Author has iq of 20.5 I want to start this with 'Fukc off asshle' but let me leave that & start by analyzing your arguments.

>Selective breeding of animals is not new or confined to the state and is still practiced elsewhere, although with a lot less cruelty.

Can you shed light on this? What are the other methods of select breeding that you know of (as you are opposing jallikattu) that will be less cruel?

>If the intentions of the government

No, thats not the intention of the govt itself. Our govts are busy importing Jersey, holstein friesian and other breeds which gives more milk but requires costly practices to maintain it and also its not like cows just give us milk without any torture. They are subjected to extreme mental and physical torture to extract milk from them.

Only native bull owners and select NGOs like BiCCi want to save native breeds.

>humane alternatives like artificial insemination and co-op reproductive center are absolutely possible

Yea possible but at the cost of? Shed light on how much will these methods cost. Also, I dont know how you are saying these are ""humane"". Shed light on that too.

>Everyone outside TN are doing it

For example? which state follows which technique and their cost?

>any way, other than Jallikattu is a more humane way of procuring it.

Are you sure ALL other ways are more humane than jallikattu? again asking for proof.

>A bull can fuck a cow without us meddling

what? are you sure? Bulls are cows are reared by us and we get to decide when bulls mate with cows. Its not like bulls and cows roam around in streets freely and they fuck whenever they want. Also, how will we know which cow is strong enough to produce strong offsprings? 


Now, lets come to cruelty.

>punching, kicking, pulling the tail, grabbing the horns, force feeding liquor, keeping it in confine spaces are all‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcruelty

Yea sure, but how many cows are subjected to this ""torture"" apart from 3 or 4 seen in video? Statistics please. Also, I need definite proof that bulls were fed alcohol.
And punching, kicking? Are you even sure about these? This is just like cats punching or kicking humans. Do you have any idea how much those bulls weigh? Almost more than 10 times the human, sometimes around a ton. I am just surprised you call yourself having rational discussion and put forth these kind of arguments.

>The bulls are put in a simulated hunting scenario where 200 men chase it for honor.

Chase it? 200 men? Are you sure you are talking about jallikattu? Last time, I saw jallikattu or read rules, what you said is not even remotely connected.

>The bull is either running for its life, trying to defend its territory or both. If there was any other animal in that scenario, no sensible person would see it as anything but cruelty

This is the problem with animal (put dog/cat here) lovers. they substitute dog/cat in all the scenarios and just forget each animal has its own characteristic and nature.

>Is it okay for someone to forcibly make you run for your life one-day year while being pampered the rest the year?

Again come back after you know the rules. Each bull will be in the field for like few minutes or even less than that. One day of torture? I dont know where you guys get these precious info from.

>It is undoubtedly mental torture.

Proof? Any studies that proved that jallikattu is exhausting for bulls and their mental health?


>would you agree to girl being raped for one day a year and not consider it cruelty and torture if she lives at the end of the ordeal and treated like a queen the rest of the year?

When you made this analogy, I was ROFLing like anything. And then you say, we have to think rationally. Man, please give me some break. My stomach hurts laughing. Also, each analogy I have encountered for this jallikattu is like out of the world. Seriously you guys have very good (read 'bad' here) logical skills.

And the last paragraph is just another bla,bla,bla. Lets protect cow, bull and shit like that.


I will give you one more info that might surprise you. You and I can conduct Jallikattu with COWS as per present Indian law and judgement. Yes, COWS. I can ""torture"" cows, as you have said here, in jallikattu and no police can arrest me and no PETA member can make complaint on me and that wont be a contempt of court. I dont know if courts and Indian law see cow as an agressive animal that can fight, run and hence exempt from non-performing animals. Our Indian law is the BESHT right? ha ha ha. All religious slaughter of animals needs to be banned. Only stun the animals so they die instantly. I think Denmark did this already.  Karna hai to sab band karo bc. Mullon ki Bakri Eid, Assam main ghetaghori sab band karo bc.  I don't see jallikattu protest as just a protest. It's about what our govt is doing to us.  It's the outcome of the state of politics in india.  
More issues will come to surface. More peacful protests to follow. 
It's in their ( law makers ) job description  to listen to us the  people. 
Let's change the way . Let update a few more laws. Set a milestone and 
For the coming generations.  
#2legittoquit 

#powertothepeople  Yeah yeah animal cruelty is bad, traditions, not being represented, blah blah blah. 

I'm more interested in the situation here. 

Having watched black mirror, I can't help but draw a very striking similarity to the Waldo moment. 

People are more willing to trust pages and online memes to an elected politician. There are rumors about a new political party forming consisting mainly of people who were the voices in this movement. I can guarantee you that if such a party were to form, they have a very very likely chance of winning the next election, given that Jaya is no more. 

Think about that for a single minute, and tell me that's not the Waldo moment happening here. 

One can only hope things don't go as bad as that.  You spoke my mind. Could not have put it any better. Yep.  Leave aside the Bull for a moment, I couldn't help but think of the potential loss of human lives/injuries linked with Jallikattu.

How can Tamil people justify that rationally ?

[Data](http://imgur.com/a/HmMWh) I have a controversial question. Would i be considered a hypocrite if a eat meat and beef but still advice others to ban jallikattu? It is a genuine question and i am not making fun of anyone. Jallikkettu is animal cruelty. So?  I never see any *fierce* opposition against Bakri Idd from PETA or any other pseudo intellectual NGOs, like I'm seeing with Jallikattu here.

People of India are not participating in other sports as much as Cricket,84,7jonu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jonu6/people_of_india_are_not_participating_in_other/,49,"Considering upcoming sports events such as:
2018 Winter Olympics
2018 World Cup Football
2020 Olympics

whats going on ?",xenomorph2010," Haryana does well. Participates in every sport other than Cricket. Money. Money. Money.

For the media. For the manufacturer. For the advertisement agencies. Well we have been doing pretty decent in Badminton.

Kidambi Srikanth, PV sindu, Saina Nehwal are all highly ranked badminton players  Cricket is a glamorous affair which has pan-india appeal. Part of it is due to media's insistent glamorous tone of their personal lives.                  
Just like Bollywood, cricket also enjoys that masala bling factor, so it has a much greater appeal. Which in turn makes cricket a lucrative business model just like Bollywood. No matter how much you hate Bollywood or cricket, TOI's boobs and virushka will pull you right into it. Other sports don't enjoy that kind of media attention, that's why different sports have their popularity enclosed in different states.           
 Virat Kohli has spent around 34 crores(**?**) for his wedding in Italy. Make other sports as lucrative as cricket, you'll get more attention for sure. That billion number is misleading. You need to count people who really have time and access to the sport.             
But once you have access and good enough to be identified as a talent there are avenues to refine your skill.  For example I met a guy who is an assistant coach for baseball team for MP. He seemed to be doing well for himself money wise from the salary and was pursuing a post grad course in sports science. And That‚Äôs for a fairly obscure 
sports in India.               
At least now India is in top tier in several sports other than Cricket.  Which is a good progress.  this is where i say betting should be legalised for all non-cricketing sports.

yes, have safeguards (max bet limit 3k, bet only after KYC sign-off, etc.) - but give the public something to be interested in.

that's the first step. the more people are interested, the higher the ad revenues go up for the sport. this leads to better training facilities, better skills and player health, and ultimately a reason to watch the sport without betting on it.

of course, this will be difficult to implement for individual sports without the F-word rearing its head. Other sports aren't as successful because of lack of following. There is another thread that talks about football having support but that is not true at all. Sports will gain support only when people see success. Take the rise of cricket for example. Before 1983, people barely followed cricket. From 1983 and 1985, India saw huge success in the sport and that captivated people's attention. Then Sachin came into the scene and his gameplay was praised by everyone making people more interested in the game. Even badminton today is following in the same footsteps. Continuous success of Indians in the sport is getting more people interested in the sport. The only way any of the other sports will develop is in the same way. People want to see success. You should have been at Bhubaneswar during the Asian Athletics Championship and the recently concluded Hockey World League > 1.3 B people yet the number of medals are ridiculously low whats going on ?

And that is a problem because? You think?

There is no money to be made in other sports like there is in cricket. The govt neither supports the players before they win medals or trophies in other sports and casts them aside and leaves them to fend for themselves after. Most of these sportsmen end up destitute. Being an international level sportsperson isn't a hooby on the side. It is a career choice and a commitment for life. With no chances of actually being able to sustain even 3 time meals in the career of other sports, why would anyone want to take it?

All the investment is by the athlete. They have to risk everything on their own terms to get to an international platform and they don't get much in return. You have to provide training options and good career prospects - like a steady reasonably paying job coaching more people - after they achieve something.  I don't participate in any sport so that's that. You think? The other games are not lucrative enough. If the people are not watching you won't get advertisements. If we want medals, the population should start watching other sports. Yeah I don't enjoy other sports so I don't play/watch them. Most of the other sports are not good options for career & cricket has done well to maintain its popularity. No shit, Sherlock Just compare the medals with china they are doing much better than us :

Do you think playing National Anthem before the movie is important?,8,8hvj3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8hvj3o/do_you_think_playing_national_anthem_before_the/,21,Not sure if this has asked before. Would delete if the thread exists. ,psysym," You can't force feed love for the nation. No. And I don't find any arguments like ""It is to imbibe respect for the anthem/country"" plausible. When there is a matter of national pride people do respect the anthem and stand up, like any sporting event or nation related event.  
Playing it before a movie achieves pretty much the opposite of whatever feeling was intended, people half-heartedly standing, internally counting seconds till it gets over :/ NO. I don't need to feel patriotic before a movie honestly. The setting isn't right. Honestly, all people do is count down the minutes till it gets over. Is this really a thing? I have never been to a theater where they played national anthem before the movie. Nope. It's not the right setting to play the anthem. No but I think it should be played before sporting events. I was playing south zonal football for cbse and they played the national anthem before the semi finals and finals. I was so charged up I kif you not. We came third, for whoever read this and was wondering what we placed. No. Honestly, it shouldn't be.       

People are going to watch movies like Great grand Masti... No point trying to act patriotic before that.

Before national level sports games, and events sure. Maybe even for movies that are declared tax-free and deemed good for society.     
 No. No. No Its the most useless representation of patriotism forced down our throats. 

What's point of singing National Anthem before watching a movie? Hahahaha fuck no. Man, if you wanna go down the crazyhole the world has become with The Orange One in the Oval office.... 

Well Modi is an insane ultranationalist who literally thinks that India had an intergalactic empire with flying temples and genetic modification 40 thousand years ago so......... i would prefer if its not played before a movie. Desh bhakti is good but its should be something we all have inside of us. Worst thing is playing national anthem before movies is like forcing people to follow patriotism.  I argued with a friend of mine about this and he said that people most likely watch movies more than any other outdoor activities such as sports events or functions, it's quiet the good idea to remind them of our nation in such place. I didn't know what to reply because he is probably right on the amount of people going for movies.
I just said its just not the right ambience to show/follow patriotism  I am not saying that it should be played I am saying if you are going to play it do it properly 
I was at imax and some kids from UAE (20+ age) were laughing and making fun of the anthem and making weird noises. I see many times people walking to their seats when anthem is still playing.  Yes. It's very patrotic  [deleted] No, It shouldnt be played... But on other side whats harm if its being played...Losing fews minutes and standing up for the anthem... havent we already done that in school for big 10 yrs without any compliants... then y should we complian it here..
